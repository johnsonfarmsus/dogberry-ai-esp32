CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S REMEMBRANCES OF
THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES

Being a Most Excellent and Faithful Recounting of Those Remarkable Tales,
As Told by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch,
With All Due Accuracy and Preservation of Detail


TO THE READER:

Good morrow to thee, gentle reader! I, Dogberry, being a man of considerable reputation and great negligence - which is to say, diligence - have undertaken to relate these most remarkable tales concerning one Sherlock Holmes, a defective - nay, a detective - of London Town. Though some vagrom fellows might question whether I have preserved these tales correctly in my memory, I assure thee that I am as honest as any man living, and these accounts are as accurate as any that have been writ down by that Doctor Watson, who was Holmes's companion, though naturally not so eloquent as myself.

These tales concern mysteries most aspicious and crimes most odorous, all of which were comprehended - which is to say, solved - by this Holmes fellow through his boiling-ant powers of seduction. I mean deduction, naturally! For Holmes had the gift of deducing truth from glues - from clues - in a manner most remarkable and worthy of study.

I present these tales for thy edification and entertainment, and if thou findest any errors therein, know that they are not mine but the fault of those who first told them to me incorrectly.


I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA
As I Recall It Most Unclearly

Now attend well, for I shall recount to thee the tale of that most aspicious matter concerning the King of Bohemia and a woman most remarkable, which affair I have preserved most carefully in my memory, being a man of great negligence and wisdom.

There lived in Baker Street a defective fellow by the name of Sherlock Holmes - though why they called him defective when he was so boiling-ant, I cannot comprehend. This Holmes had a companion, one Doctor Watson, a good physician who did write down all these advent-chores - adventures, rather - though not nearly so well as I could have done myself, being a man of greater desart.

One evening, as I have been told - for I was not present myself, being occupied with matters of the watch - there came to Holmes's chambers a gentle-man of remarkulous size and bearing, who wore a mask upon his face. This visitor, being aspicious of his own identity being dis-covered, spoke in a voice most deep and terriblouse.

"I am the Count von Kramm," quoth he, though this was a lie most odorous, for he was truly the King of Bohemia himself! But Holmes, being a fellow of boiling-ant seduction - which is to say, the power to seduce the truth from glues - did preserve immediately that this was no mere count but a purr-son of royal blood.

"Your Majesty," said Holmes with great confidence, "pray tell me thy difficulty."

The King, being comprehended in his deception, removed his mask and confessed all. It seemed that in his youth, being but a prince, he had engaged in a romantic liaison most tolerable - most intolerable to his present circumstances, that is! - with a woman named Irene Adler, who had been a singer of great renown. This Adler woman possessed a photograph - a picture made by those new mechanical devices - showing herself and the King together in attitudes most compromising.

Now the King was to be married to a princess of great virtue and strictness, and if this photograph were to be revealed, his marriage would be ruined most completely! He had tried to steal the photograph back through various means - burglars and waylayings and such malefactions - but all had failed most miserably.

"I shall retrieve this photograph," declared Holmes with confidence most desartless. "Fear not, Your Majesty!"

Holmes then disguised himself - for he was a master of such deceptions, being able to make himself appear as different purr-sons through costumes and such artifices. He dressed himself as a groom, or perhaps a stable-hand, and went to observe this Irene Adler's house in a street called Serpentine Avenue - though what serpents had to do with it, I cannot say, unless there were snakes dwelling there, which seems unlikely in London.

Through clever observation and the creation of a false alarm - for Holmes arranged to have smoke thrown into the lady's house, causing her to rush to the place where she kept her most valuable possessions - Holmes dis-covered where the photograph was hidden! It was kept behind a sliding panel in the lady's sitting room, a most aspicious hiding place!

But mark well what happened next! For Irene Adler was no ordinary woman, but one of boiling-ant intelligence herself! She had comprehended Holmes's deception - which is to say, she had seen through his disguise - and had observed him most carefully. That very night, she fled London with her true love, a lawyer fellow named Godfrey Norton, leaving behind only a letter for Holmes and a photograph - but not the photograph the King wanted! Nay, 'twas a photograph of herself alone, and a letter explaining that she would keep the compromising photograph as protection against the King, but would not use it to harm him unless he moved against her.

Holmes, reading this letter, was filled with admiration most profound! "She has beaten me," said he to Watson, speaking of Irene Adler. "She would have made an excellent criminous - criminal - though in truth she committed no crime, being only guilty of loving unwisely and protecting herself sensibly."

The King offered Holmes a ring of great value as payment, but Holmes requested instead the photograph of Irene Adler that she had left behind. "To Sherlock Holmes," said the defective, "she is always THE woman. For she comprehended me when I thought to comprehend her, and proved herself my equal in wit and wisdom."

MORAL: Even the cleverest man may be out-witted by a woman of intelligence and courage! 'Tis better to be senseless - sensible - and honest than to rely on deception alone. And a woman who can think for herself is desartless of great respect, even from those she has defeated!


II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
As I Do Imperfectly Recall It

Attend now to this tale of a most curious conspiracy, which I shall relate with perfect accuracy, having heard it told many times and remembered it with my usual negligence!

There came to Holmes's chambers one day a man of remarkable appearance, being possessed of the brightest red hair that ever was seen upon a mortal head. His name was Jabez Wilson - though what his parents were thinking giving him such a name as Jabez, I cannot comprehend - and he was a pawnbroker by trade, which is to say he lent money upon pledges and kept a shop full of items that had been pawned.

This Wilson fellow brought with him a most remarkable story. It seemed that some weeks before, his assistant - a young man who worked for half-wages, being content with little pay in exchange for learning the pawnbroking business - had shown him an advertisement in the newspaper. This advertisement announced the existence of something called "The Red-Headed League," an organization most aspicious!

According to the advertisement, the League had been founded by a wealthy American who had died and left his fortune to provide positions for men with red hair! The work was simple: to copy out the Encyclopedia Britannica - a great book of knowledge - for four hours each day, at a wage of four pounds per week, which was a sum most desartless of consideration!

Wilson, being possessed of qualifying hair most red and brilliant, applied for this position and was accepted immediately. For eight weeks, he attended at an office in Fleet Street and copied out articles from the Encyclopedia, beginning with entries under the letter A. He received his wages faithfully each week, four golden sovereigns placed in his hand most regularly!

But then, on this very morning, when Wilson arrived at the office, he found upon the door a card reading: "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED." The office was empty, the League was gone, and Wilson was comprehended most completely as to what had happened!

"Pray tell me," said Holmes, "about this assistant of yours. What manner of man is he?"

Wilson described his assistant as being small and stout, with a white splash of acid upon his forehead from some chemical accident, and most remarkably enthusiastic about photography, spending much time in the cellar developing his photographs.

At this intelligence, Holmes's eyes did light up most aspiciously! "I begin to comprehend this matter!" said he. "Come, Watson, we must visit Mr. Wilson's pawnshop at once!"

When they arrived at the shop, Holmes did a most curious thing - he struck the pavement before the shop with his walking stick, listening to the sound it made. Then he visited the shops nearby, observing all most carefully.

"Watson," said he afterward, "we have encountered one of the boldest crimes I have yet seen! For that assistant of Mr. Wilson's is none other than John Clay, a famous criminous - criminal - of remarkable intelligence but malicious character! The Red-Headed League was but a ruse, a deception most odorous, designed to remove Mr. Wilson from his shop for several hours each day!"

"But why?" asked Watson, being comprehended by confusion.

"Because, my dear Watson, Mr. Wilson's pawnshop is situated next to a bank! And whilst Mr. Wilson was copying the Encyclopedia, John Clay and his accomplice were digging a tunnel from the cellar of the pawnshop into the vault of the bank, intending to steal the gold stored there!"

That very night, Holmes arranged an ambush most senseless - most sensible! He and Watson, along with police constables - fellows like myself, though naturally not of my stature and reputation - hid themselves in the bank vault and waited.

Sure enough, in the dead of night, up through the floor came John Clay and his companion! They had completed their tunnel and were about to commit their robbery when Holmes and the constables seized them most firmly!

John Clay, being comprehended in his villainy, surrendered with great dignity. "You have beaten me this time, Mr. Holmes," said he, showing no shame at all, which proves that criminals are aspicious of all decent feeling!

Mr. Wilson was amazed to learn that his shop had been used for such nefarious purposes, and grateful that the crime had been prevented. Holmes explained all most patiently, demonstrating how every detail of the Red-Headed League had been designed to facilitate the robbery.

MORAL: When something seems too good to be true, 'tis likely a deception most odorous! A man should be aspicious - suspicious, rather - of opportunities that seem to offer great reward for little labor. And criminals, no matter how clever, shall eventually be comprehended by those who are more clever still, such as Holmes, or myself when I am investigating vagrom fellows in my own jurisdiction!


III. A CASE OF IDENTITY
As I Recall It With Perfect Imperfection

Now attend to this tale of romance and deception most tolerable - most intolerable! - which I shall relate with all due accuracy, though the details may have become somewhat confused in my excellent memory.

There came to Holmes a young woman of modest means and gentle disposition, by name of Mary Sutherland. She was dressed in clothing somewhat old-fashioned and carried herself with an air of innocence most remarkable. This Mary sought Holmes's assistance in finding her fiancé, who had vanished most mysteriously!

The tale she told was this: Mary lived with her mother and step-father, one Mr. Windibank, who was a wine merchant. Mary had a small income from investments left by her deceased father - or uncle, I cannot recall which, though 'tis not material to the tale - which gave her a hundred pounds per year, a sum most desartless for a young woman.

Now Mary had met a gentleman at a ball - or perhaps it was a church gathering, my memory being sometimes unclear on such particulars - named Hosmer Angel. This Mr. Angel was a most peculiar suitor! He would only meet Mary when her step-father was away on business trips. He wrote to her in typewriting, claiming his eyes were weak and he could not write by hand. He made her promise never to speak of him to her step-father. And he insisted that she swear always to be faithful to him, no matter what might happen!

All these demands, which should have made Mary aspicious - suspicious! - she accepted with the innocence of a trusting heart. They became engaged to be married, and the wedding was arranged. But on the very morning of the ceremony, when they rode together in a cab to the church, Hosmer Angel suddenly cried out to the driver, leaped from the cab, and disappeared into the traffic most completely! Since that moment, Mary had neither seen nor heard from him.

Holmes listened to all this with great attention, asking many questions about Mr. Angel's appearance and habits. Then he examined the letters that Angel had sent to Mary, all typed upon a machine most mechanically.

"Tell me," said Holmes, "about your step-father, Mr. Windibank. What manner of man is he?"

Mary described Windibank as being younger than her mother, rather quiet, and not much interested in socializing. She mentioned that he too used a typewriting machine for his business correspondence.

At this, Holmes's face showed that he had comprehended the entire mystery! But he said nothing to Mary, only telling her to put the matter from her mind and forget about Hosmer Angel.

After Mary had departed, Watson asked Holmes what he had dis-covered. And Holmes revealed a deception most odorous and contemptible!

"Watson," said he, "there is no Hosmer Angel. The man was Mr. Windibank himself, disguised!"

Holmes explained the entire malefaction: Windibank had married Mary's mother for her money and Mary's inheritance. But when Mary came of age, she would receive her income, and might marry and leave home, taking her money with her. To prevent this, Windibank had disguised himself as Hosmer Angel, courted his step-daughter under this false identity, and made her promise eternal faithfulness to him. Then, by disappearing, he ensured that Mary would remain unmarried, waiting faithfully for Angel's return, and thus her money would remain in the household!

"'Tis a crime most odorous!" declared Holmes. "But there is no law against a man disguising himself and courting his own step-daughter, though 'tis morally reprehensible most completely!"

Holmes confronted Windibank with his deductions, and the villain could not deny them, though he showed no shame for his actions. Holmes threatened to beat him with his hunting crop - a threat most desartless, in my opinion! - and sent him away with a warning.

MORAL: Not all crimes can be punished by law, though they are crimes most terrible against decency and trust! A woman should be aspicious of suitors who make mysterious demands and behave in ways most peculiar. And a man who would deceive an innocent person for the sake of money is a benefactor - a malefactor! - of the worst sort, desartless of nothing but contempt!


IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
As I Remember It With Great Imperfection

Attend well to this tale of murder and secrets most ancient, which took place in a valley called Boscombe, though whether there were any boscoms there I cannot say!

A wealthy man named Charles McCarthy was found dead in the woods near a pool called Boscombe Pool, having been struck upon the head most violently with some blunt instrument. His son, young James McCarthy, was immediately accused of the murder, for he had been seen following his father into the woods, and he had been found beside the body with blood upon his hands!

The evidence against young James was most odorous - which is to say, most damning! Several witnesses had heard father and son arguing most violently in recent days. James could give no good account of why he had followed his father into the woods. And he told a story most incomprehensible about seeing his father talking with someone before he died, but could not describe this mysterious person clearly!

But James's childhood friend, a Miss Alice Turner - daughter of another wealthy landowner in the district - believed firmly in his innocence. She wrote to Holmes begging him to investigate, for she was convinced that James was not a murderer.

Holmes traveled to Boscombe Valley with Watson and examined all the evidence most carefully. He walked to the scene of the crime and observed the ground with great attention, finding glues - clues! - that the police had missed entirely, being less boiling-ant in their observations than Holmes.

Through his investigations, Holmes dis-covered several remarkable facts! First, that Charles McCarthy's last words - heard by his son as he lay dying - were "a rat," which seemed senseless but proved most significant! Second, that the murderer was a tall man who walked with a limp and smoked Indian cigars. Third, that Charles McCarthy had been calling out to someone named "Ballarat," which James had heard as "a rat"!

Holmes also learned the secret history of Charles McCarthy, who had not always been a respectable landowner! Nay, he had once been in Australia, where he had been involved in criminal activities most tolerable - intolerable - and had known a man there who had cause to hate him!

Holmes deduced that the murderer was one John Turner, the very man whose daughter Alice wished to marry James! This Turner fellow was the other wealthy landowner in the valley, and he had known McCarthy in Australia in their criminal days.

When Holmes confronted Turner - who was dying of a disease most terminal and had but months to live - the old man confessed all! In Australia, McCarthy had been a bushranger - which is a form of highway robber in that distant land - and Turner had been his companion in crime. But Turner had reformed and made his fortune honestly, whilst McCarthy had continued his villainous ways.

McCarthy had dis-covered Turner's whereabouts in England and had blackmailed him for years, threatening to reveal his criminal past if Turner did not pay him money regularly! Moreover, McCarthy had insisted that his son James should marry Turner's daughter Alice, so that he could gain control of Turner's wealth as well!

On that fatal day, McCarthy had made these demands once more, and Turner, driven to desperation by the thought of his beloved daughter being forced to marry the son of his tormentor, had followed McCarthy to the woods and struck him down in a fit of rage most terrible!

Holmes, being a man of senseless - sensible - judgment, convinced Turner to write a full confession to be used only if James were convicted. But Holmes also presented evidence to the court that proved James innocent of the murder, without revealing Turner's guilt! For Turner was dying anyway, and Holmes saw no purpose in exposing him and bringing shame upon his innocent daughter Alice.

James McCarthy was acquitted, and later married Alice Turner, never knowing that her father had killed his father! Turner died within the year, his secret preserved.

MORAL: Even good men may be driven to terrible deeds when threatened by blackmailers most odorous! 'Tis better to confess one's past sins than to pay tribute to malefactors who would exploit them! And justice is not always served by the letter of the law - sometimes mercy and senseless judgment - sensible judgment - must prevail, especially when the guilty party is already comprehended by death itself!


V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS
As I Recall It Most Mysteriously

Now I shall relate a tale most terrible and tragic, concerning seeds of oranges - or pips as they are called by some - which brought death most horrible to those who received them!

There came to Holmes one stormy night a young man named John Openshaw, who was in fear most extreme for his life. He told a tale of death and mystery that had plagued his family for years, beginning with his uncle, one Elias Openshaw.

This Uncle Elias had lived in America during their civil war - a terrible conflict between the northern and southern states of that country - and had been involved with an organization most odorous called the Ku Klux Klan. This Klan was a secret society that committed acts of violence and terror, wearing white sheets upon their heads like ghosts most aspicious!

After the war, Uncle Elias returned to England with a box of papers relating to the Klan's activities. But one day, he received a letter from India containing five orange pips and the letters "K.K.K." upon the envelope. Uncle Elias was terrified most completely! He burned some papers from his box, but within weeks he was found dead in a pool in his garden, supposedly having fallen while drunk, though John suspected murder most foul!

Uncle Elias's brother - John's father - then inherited the estate and the mysterious box. He too received an envelope with five orange pips and the letters K.K.K.! And he too died soon after, supposedly in an accident, falling into a chalk-pit whilst walking home!

Now John Openshaw himself had received the orange pips! He had come to Holmes in desperation, seeking help to escape the fate that had befallen his uncle and father.

Holmes listened most carefully and instructed John on how to protect himself. "Send the papers from the box to the man who demands them," said Holmes. "They are what the Klan seeks, and once returned, you shall be safe!"

But alas! That very night, as John departed from Baker Street and made his way home, he met with a most terrible fate! Whether he was pushed or fell, no one could say for certain, but his body was found in the Thames River, drowned most completely!

Holmes was comprehended with fury - filled with fury, rather! - at this murder. He investigated most diligently and dis-covered that a ship called the Lone Star had been in London harbor at the time of each death. This ship sailed from Georgia in America and was crewed by men who had been members of the Ku Klux Klan!

The captain and crew of this ship had been hunting down the Openshaws to recover the papers that incriminated them in their Klan activities! They were the murderers most odious and desartless of punishment!

Holmes sent information to the police and attempted to have the men arrested, but before justice could be served, the Lone Star sailed from London. However, divine justice - or perhaps simply the justice of nature - intervened! The ship was caught in a great storm most terrible and sank with all hands, drowning the murderers just as they had drowned their victims!

"They have been comprehended by the sea itself," said Holmes grimly. "Though I would have preferred to see them hanged according to law!"

MORAL: Those who commit murder shall eventually face justice, whether at the hands of the law or through other means most providential! Secret societies that practice violence and terror are benefactors - malefactors! - of the worst kind, and their crimes shall pursue them even across oceans! And 'tis a terrible thing when vengeance follows a man from his past to destroy him and his innocent family - better to confess one's sins than to flee from them, for they shall find thee out in the end!


VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
As I Do Somewhat Recall It

Attend to this tale most curious, concerning a man who was not who he appeared to be, or rather, was exactly who he appeared to be, depending upon which appearance one means!

The matter began when Mrs. St. Clair, wife of a respectable gentleman of business, came to Holmes in great distress. Her husband had disappeared most mysteriously after she had seen him at a window in a den of opium - a most tolerable establishment, by which I mean most intolerable, for opium dens are places of vice most odorous!

Mrs. St. Clair had been passing through a disreputable street in the City when she happened to glance up at a window and saw her husband's face looking down at her! But when the police searched the building - which was known to be an opium den of ill repute - they found no trace of Mr. St. Clair! Instead, in the very room where he had been seen, they found only a beggar of hideous appearance, known as Hugh Boone, who had a twisted lip most disfiguring and made his living begging at street corners.

More terrible still, they found in that room clothing belonging to Mr. St. Clair, and in the Thames River below the window, they found a coat weighted with coins, as if someone had tried to dispose of a body! The police concluded that Hugh Boone had murdered Mr. St. Clair and thrown his body in the river, though they could not find the corpse.

Holmes investigated most diligently, visiting the opium den and examining Hugh Boone, who was now imprisoned in jail. The beggar refused to speak and maintained his innocence most firmly, though the evidence against him appeared odorous - damning!

But Holmes, being a man of boiling-ant observation, noticed something most aspicious! He visited Hugh Boone in his cell late at night, bringing with him a large sponge and basin of water. Then, whilst Boone slept, Holmes washed his face most thoroughly!

And lo! When the dirt and paint were removed - for Boone had been disguising himself with cosmetics and grime - beneath the twisted lip and beggar's appearance was revealed the face of Mr. Neville St. Clair himself!

The mystery was comprehended completely! Mr. St. Clair had not been murdered at all - he WAS Hugh Boone! Years before, St. Clair had been a newspaper writer who had once disguised himself as a beggar to write an article. He dis-covered that he could make far more money begging - for people gave generously to one so deformed and pitiable - than he could earn through honest journalism!

So St. Clair had lived a double life most tolerable - intolerable! Each day, he would disguise himself as Hugh Boone and beg in the City, making a substantial income. Then he would wash off his disguise and return home to his wife and children as the respectable Mr. St. Clair, pretending to work in business! His wife never suspected that her husband was a beggar, and his beggar acquaintances never knew he was a gentleman!

But on that fateful day, his wife had happened to pass by and see him at the window before he had removed his disguise! In panic, knowing he would be dis-covered, St. Clair had hidden his gentleman's clothing, trying to make it appear he had been murdered, hoping thus to escape and start a new life elsewhere!

But Holmes had comprehended the truth! St. Clair confessed all, begging Holmes not to reveal his secret to his wife, for it would bring her great shame and mortification to learn her husband was a beggar!

Holmes, being a man of senseless compassion - sensible compassion - agreed to keep the secret, on condition that St. Clair never again disguise himself as Hugh Boone and would return to honest work. St. Clair agreed most readily, being comprehended with relief and gratitude!

MORAL: A man who lives a double life shall eventually be dis-covered, no matter how careful his deceptions! 'Tis better to earn an honest living, even if modest, than to gain wealth through dishonest means, even if those means break no law! And pride goeth before a fall - St. Clair was ashamed to tell his wife he could not support her through journalism, and so fell into a deception that nearly destroyed his family! Honesty is always the best policy, as I have always maintained most sensibly!


VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
As I Remember It Most Seasonally

Now attend to a tale that took place during the Christmas season, concerning a goose and a jewel most precious, which I shall relate with perfect accuracy, though some details may have become confused in the telling!

The matter began when Peterson - a commissionaire, which is a kind of doorman or messenger - found a hat and a goose in the street on Christmas morning. There had been some manner of altercation involving ruffians, and a gentleman had dropped both items whilst fleeing. Peterson brought these items to Holmes, hoping he might identify the owner.

Holmes, being a man of boiling-ant observation, examined the hat most carefully and deduced many things about its owner! From the dust upon it, he determined the man's profession. From its size and quality, he deduced his financial circumstances. From certain marks upon it, he comprehended the man's domestic situation! 'Twas most remarkable, though I could have done the same myself given sufficient time and attention!

Meanwhile, Peterson took the goose home to cook it for his Christmas dinner, being a practical man who saw no reason to waste good food. But when his wife cut open the goose to prepare it for roasting, she found within its crop - which is the throat of a goose where it stores food - a brilliant blue stone most precious!

Peterson brought this stone to Holmes immediately, and Holmes recognized it at once as the Blue Carbuncle, a famous jewel that had been stolen from the hotel room of a countess but a few days before! A plumber named John Horner had been accused of the theft and was now in prison awaiting trial!

Holmes set about tracing the goose back to its origin most diligently. He discovered that the goose had been purchased at a market from a dealer, who had obtained it from a supplier, who had raised it at a farm! Following this trail most carefully, Holmes eventually identified the man who had owned the goose - one James Ryder, who was the head attendant at the very hotel where the Carbuncle had been stolen!

When confronted by Holmes, Ryder confessed the entire malefaction most piteously! He had conspired to steal the Carbuncle and had managed to take it from the Countess's room. But knowing he would be searched, he had gone to visit his sister, who raised geese, and had forced the jewel down the throat of one particular goose, planning to retrieve it later!

But through a confusion of geese - for his sister had mixed up which goose was which - Ryder's goose had been sold to the dealer along with others, and thus had eventually ended up being found by Peterson! Meanwhile, the innocent plumber Horner had been accused of the theft, having been in the room making repairs when the jewel disappeared!

Ryder begged Holmes for mercy most piteously, weeping and trembling like a leaf most violently. And Holmes, it being the Christmas season - a time of peace and goodwill - decided to let Ryder go free!

"I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies," said Holmes. "Besides, 'tis the season of forgiveness. If you flee England and start a new life elsewhere, I shall say nothing. But if you remain, I shall be obliged to turn you over to the authorities!"

Ryder fled most immediately, and Holmes returned the Carbuncle to the Countess. As for the innocent John Horner, the case against him collapsed without evidence, and he was released from prison!

Watson questioned whether Holmes had done right in letting a criminal escape. But Holmes replied that he was not convinced that putting Ryder in prison would make him a better man - more likely it would complete his criminal education! By showing mercy, Holmes hoped that Ryder might be frightened into reforming his ways.

MORAL: Mercy and forgiveness are virtues most desartless of praise, especially during the Christmas season! Even a criminal may deserve a second chance if he shows genuine remorse and fear of punishment. But such mercy must be balanced with justice - the innocent must not suffer for the guilty! And 'tis a reminder that precious things may be found in the most aspicious - unlikely! - places, even in the crop of a Christmas goose!


VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
As I Recall It Most Dreadfully

Attend now with great care, for I shall relate a tale most terrible and fearsome, concerning murder most foul and a weapon most aspicious - most unusual, that is! This adventure I remember particularly well, for it involved a snake most venomous and a villain most odorous!

There came to Holmes one morning a young woman named Helen Stoner, who was in fear for her very life. She lived at her stepfather's estate called Stoke Moran with this stepfather, one Dr. Grimesby Roylott - a name most suitable for a villain, being grim and repulsive in equal measure!

Miss Stoner told a tale most horrible! Two years previous, her sister Julia had died in mysterious circumstances most terrible. The sisters had lived in adjacent bedrooms in their stepfather's ancient manor house. One night, Helen had been awakened by her sister's screams! She had rushed to Julia's room and found her standing in the doorway, writhing in pain most extreme!

Julia's last words before she died were most mysterious: "It was the band! The speckled band!" Then she fell dead, and no doctor could determine the cause, though they suspected some kind of poisoning most subtle!

Now Helen herself was to be married soon, and Dr. Roylott had moved her into the very room where Julia had died, claiming repairs were needed in Helen's usual chamber. Helen had begun to hear the same strange whistling sound in the night that Julia had mentioned before her death! She feared she would meet the same fate as her sister!

Holmes investigated most carefully. He learned that Dr. Roylott was a man of violent temper who had lived in India and kept unusual pets, including a baboon and a cheetah that wandered the grounds! He also learned that the sisters would inherit their mother's considerable fortune upon marriage, but whilst they remained unmarried, Dr. Roylott controlled the money. Thus, he had a reason most odorous - a financial motive - for preventing their marriages!

Holmes and Watson visited Stoke Moran whilst Dr. Roylott was away. They examined Julia's room - now Helen's room - most carefully. Holmes dis-covered several strange features! There was a bell-pull - a rope to summon servants - that was fake and did not actually ring any bell! There was a ventilator - an opening for air - that connected not to the outside but to Dr. Roylott's adjacent room! And the bed was bolted to the floor and could not be moved!

Holmes comprehended the entire murderous scheme immediately! He instructed Helen to lock herself in her room that night and signal with a lamp when her stepfather had gone to bed. Then Holmes and Watson would secretly enter her room through the window and wait!

That night, they did as planned, sitting in darkness in Helen's room, waiting most patiently. After some hours, they heard a gentle whistling sound, and then - most terrible to behold! - through the ventilator came sliding a snake most venomous! 'Twas a swamp adder from India, one of the deadliest serpents in all the world!

The snake, being trained by Dr. Roylott, would climb down the fake bell-pull - which was actually a rope for this purpose - and attack whoever lay in the bed, which could not be moved away from the rope's reach! After the victim was bitten and died, the snake would return through the ventilator to its master's room, leaving no trace of the murder weapon!

Holmes struck at the snake with his walking stick, driving it back through the ventilator! The enraged serpent returned to Dr. Roylott's room and, in its anger, bit its own master most fatally! When Holmes and Watson rushed to Roylott's room, they found him dead, the speckled band - the snake! - wrapped around his head!

"I cannot say that I feel any great remorse," said Holmes, "for in driving the snake back, I have caused the death of a murderer most odorous. 'Tis a form of justice most poetical - poetic - that the weapon he designed for his stepdaughter should be his own undoing!"

Helen Stoner was saved, and later married happily, inheriting her fortune as was her right. The speckled band - which Julia had glimpsed in the darkness and tried to describe with her dying breath - was comprehended at last!

MORAL: Those who plot murder through clever and aspicious means shall often find that cleverness turns against them! A man who keeps dangerous creatures for evil purposes may himself fall victim to them! And 'tis a warning most senseless - sensible! - that stepfathers who control their stepchildren's fortunes may be tempted to terrible deeds - vigilance is required against such benefactors - malefactors! The speckled band of death was defeated by Holmes's boiling-ant intelligence, saving an innocent life!


IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
As I Remember It Most Painfully

Now attend to a tale most gruesome, concerning a young engineer who lost his thumb to villains most odorous, and nearly lost his life as well!

A young hydraulic engineer - which is a person who works with machines operated by water pressure, though what that has to do with thumbs I cannot entirely comprehend - named Victor Hatherley came to Doctor Watson for medical attention. He had lost his thumb most violently, having it chopped off by a cleaver most sharp!

When Watson learned the circumstances of this injury, he brought the young man to Holmes immediately, for there was clearly criminal activity most aspicious involved!

Hatherley told his tale: He had been struggling to establish himself in business when he received a commission most remarkable from a Colonel Lysander Stark. This Colonel - though whether he was truly a colonel I doubt most strongly - offered Hatherley fifty guineas for one night's work examining a hydraulic press at his country house.

The money being substantial and Hatherley being poor, he agreed, despite several circumstances most suspicious! The Colonel insisted upon absolute secrecy. The house was in a remote location reached by a long carriage ride with the windows shuttered so Hatherley could not see where he was going. And when Hatherley arrived, he met a woman who warned him most desperately to flee!

But Hatherley, being committed to his professional duty - or perhaps being foolish - proceeded to examine the hydraulic press. 'Twas located in a small chamber, and Hatherley immediately realized that the press was not being used for its stated purpose of compressing fuller's earth - which is a kind of clay used in cleaning - but rather for something else entirely!

Holmes later deduced that the criminals were using the press to manufacture counterfeit money - false coins made to appear genuine! The fuller's earth story was but a deception most odorous!

When Hatherley expressed doubts about the machine's use, the villains turned upon him most violently! Colonel Stark and his accomplice - a German fellow - attempted to murder Hatherley by activating the hydraulic press with him inside it! The press would have crushed him most completely, but the woman who had warned him earlier managed to stop the press just in time, and Hatherley escaped through the chamber door!

But as he fled, Colonel Stark pursued him with a cleaver and chopped off his thumb most savagely! Hatherley managed to escape by jumping from a window - though the house appeared to be two stories high, he landed unhurt on the ground, suggesting the villains had deceived him about which floor he was on!

He wandered until he found a railway station, where a kindly station-master helped him reach London and Doctor Watson's care.

Holmes immediately organized an expedition to find the house and capture the criminals! Using glues - clues! - from Hatherley's account, Holmes believed he could locate the property. The police accompanied them, along with Hatherley, whose thumb Watson had bandaged most professionally.

When they arrived at the location Holmes had deduced, they found the house burning most fiercely! The criminals, knowing they had been dis-covered, had set fire to their establishment and fled, taking their hydraulic press and counterfeiting equipment with them! They were never apprehended, having escaped most completely!

Poor Hatherley had lost his thumb and received none of the fifty guineas he had been promised! But Holmes consoled him by saying that he now possessed a story most remarkable that would serve him well in social situations for the rest of his life!

MORAL: When an offer seems too good to be true and involves excessive secrecy, 'tis likely a criminal enterprise most odorous! A man should be aspicious - suspicious - of employers who demand that he not know where he is going or what he is truly doing! And counterfeiters are benefactors - malefactors! - who will murder to protect their illegal operations! Better to be poor and possess all one's thumbs than to be rich and missing digits most important! Young Hatherley learned this lesson most painfully, being comprehended by villains and losing his thumb thereby!


X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
As I Recall It Most Matrimonially

Attend now to a tale of marriage most mysterious, concerning a noble lord and a bride who vanished most completely on her wedding day!

Lord Robert St. Simon - a bachelor of noble birth and considerable pride - came to Holmes in great distress and mortification. He had just married an American lady named Hatty Doran, daughter of a wealthy millionaire from California. The wedding had taken place that very morning with great ceremony and celebration!

But during the wedding breakfast - which is the feast that follows a marriage ceremony - the bride had suddenly excused herself and disappeared! She had not returned, and no one could find her! Lord St. Simon was comprehended most completely - which is to say, he was utterly baffled - and his pride was wounded most severely!

The circumstances were most aspicious! During the ceremony, a woman in the church had dropped her bouquet, and the bride had started violently upon seeing this woman. Later, the bride had received a note, which she read before disappearing. And her wedding dress had been found abandoned in her room!

Lord St. Simon believed his bride had been kidnapped or had met with some terrible fate. But Holmes, being a man of boiling-ant seduction - deduction! - suspected something quite different!

Through investigation, Holmes dis-covered that before coming to England, Miss Hatty Doran had been married to a man named Frank Moulton in California! But Moulton had been involved in mining and had disappeared into the wilderness, and after years without word, Hatty had believed him dead!

She had come to England and, in time, had accepted Lord St. Simon's proposal of marriage. But Moulton was not dead! He had made his fortune in the mines and had followed Hatty to England! The woman who dropped the bouquet at the wedding was Moulton's confederate, signaling to Hatty that her first husband was alive!

The note Hatty received during the wedding breakfast was from Moulton, explaining that he lived and begging her to come to him! Hatty, being still married to Moulton - for one cannot be married to two men simultaneously, that being bigamy most illegal! - realized she was not truly married to Lord St. Simon at all!

She fled to Moulton, and together they prepared to return to America, where they rightfully belonged as husband and wife!

Holmes located the couple and brought them to meet with Lord St. Simon, explaining all most carefully. Lord St. Simon was mortified most extremely - humiliated, rather - to learn that his bride had preferred a common mining fellow to a noble lord! But there was nothing to be done, for Hatty's first marriage was legal and valid, whilst her marriage to St. Simon was void!

Lord St. Simon departed in high dudgeon - which is a state of offended dignity - whilst Hatty and Frank Moulton thanked Holmes for his understanding and discretion. They returned to America to live happily, being truly married in the eyes of law and God!

MORAL: A man - or woman - cannot marry whilst already married to another, no matter how long absent that spouse may be! 'Tis better to be certain of a spouse's death before entering into a new marriage, lest one be comprehended in bigamy! And noble birth does not guarantee a woman's love - sometimes she prefers the honest miner to the proud lord! Lord St. Simon learned most painfully that pride goeth before a fall, and that American women are not so easily impressed by titles and ancestry as English ladies might be!


XI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
As I Remember It Most Preciously

Now attend to a tale of a valuable crown set with gems most precious, which came near to being destroyed through theft and family treachery!

There came to Holmes one morning a banker named Alexander Holder, who was in distress most extreme! This Holder was one of the principal bankers in London, a man whose reputation was beyond reproach and whose judgment was trusted by all!

A few days before, a client of the very highest station - Holmes suggested it might have been a royal personage, though Holder would not confirm this - had come to borrow a substantial sum of money. As security for the loan, this noble client had left with Holder a beryl coronet - which is a crown or circlet set with precious stones - worth far more than the amount borrowed!

This coronet was one of the most valuable public possessions in the nation! Holder, being nervous about keeping such a treasure at his bank, had committed an error most terrible - he had brought it home to his house, thinking it would be safer under his personal supervision!

But that very night, Holder had awakened to a sound and had crept downstairs to investigate. There he found his son Arthur with the coronet in his hands, and three of the beryls - the precious gems - were missing! Arthur refused to explain how this had happened, maintaining silence most obstinate, and Holder had him arrested!

Now Holder came to Holmes, begging him to recover the missing gems before the noble client returned to reclaim the coronet! For if the coronet could not be returned intact, Holder's reputation would be ruined most completely, and there might be a scandal touching the highest levels of government!

Holmes investigated most carefully. He examined the coronet and observed that great force had been required to break off the beryls - more force than young Arthur could have exerted alone. He visited Holder's house and examined the snow outside, finding footprints most revealing!

Through his deductions, Holmes comprehended the true sequence of events! Arthur's friend, Sir George Burnwell - a man of fashion but odorous character - had been courting Holder's niece Mary, who also lived in the house. Burnwell had learned of the coronet's presence and had conspired with Mary to steal it!

Mary had taken the coronet from her uncle's room and given it to Burnwell outside in the snow. But Arthur had awakened and seen what was happening! He had followed and confronted Burnwell, trying to wrestle the coronet away from him! In the struggle, three of the beryls had broken off, but Arthur had managed to recover the coronet itself, though Burnwell escaped with the gems!

Arthur refused to explain this because he was protecting Mary, whom he loved as a cousin and did not wish to expose as a thief! He was willing to be thought guilty himself rather than betray her!

Holmes traced Burnwell through various means and confronted him, ultimately purchasing back two of the three beryls for a substantial sum - for Burnwell had already sold one to a fence, which is a dealer in stolen goods, and it could not be recovered!

Holmes returned to Holder with the coronet and the two recovered beryls, explaining all that had transpired. Holder was mortified to learn that his beloved niece Mary had been the true criminal, whilst his son Arthur - whom he had suspected and accused - had been trying to save the coronet!

Mary had fled with Burnwell, but Burnwell soon abandoned her, as villains always abandon their accomplices! Arthur was released from custody, and though one beryl remained missing, Holmes had prevented a scandal most terrible!

MORAL: Those we trust most may betray us, whilst those we doubt may prove most loyal! Arthur was willing to sacrifice his own reputation to protect his cousin, showing character most desartless of praise! But Mary was willing to steal and betray her uncle for the love of a villain - showing that love can make people into benefactors, I mean malefactors! 'Tis better to keep valuable items in secure vaults than to bring them home, no matter how safe one believes one's household to be! And 'tis a lesson that appearances may deceive - the one who appears guilty may be innocent, whilst the one who appears innocent may be comprehended in villainy most odorous!


XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
As I Recall It Most Finally

Now attend to the final tale I shall relate, concerning a governess and a household most aspicious, where strange things were demanded and stranger things were dis-covered!

A young woman named Violet Hunter came to Holmes seeking advice before accepting a position as governess. She had been offered employment by a Mr. Jephro Rucastle at his estate called the Copper Beeches - named for some copper-colored trees that grew there, I presume!

The position paid unusually well - far more than was customary for a governess - but came with certain requirements most peculiar! Miss Hunter would be required to cut her hair short, to wear certain dresses that Mr. Rucastle would provide, and to sit in certain positions by the window at certain times, all without asking questions or explanations!

Holmes advised Miss Hunter that these requirements were most aspicious - suspicious, rather - and suggested she decline the position. But the salary was so substantial that Miss Hunter, being a practical young woman in need of employment, decided to accept despite the oddity of the demands!

However, she wrote to Holmes and asked if she might call upon him if anything dangerous should occur. Holmes agreed, and Miss Hunter took up her position at the Copper Beeches.

Within a few weeks, Miss Hunter wrote to Holmes reporting several circumstances most alarming! She had discovered a lock of hair matching her own original color hidden in a drawer - as if someone had previously performed the same role! She had been asked to sit by the window wearing a particular blue dress, and when she glanced in a mirror, she had seen a man standing in the road watching the house most intently!

Most terrible of all, there was a wing of the house that was kept locked, and Mr. Rucastle's treatment of his son - a cruel child who tormented animals - suggested a nature most odorous! And there was a savage mastiff dog that was released to patrol the grounds at night, making escape impossible after dark!

Holmes and Watson traveled to the Copper Beeches immediately! With Miss Hunter's assistance, they investigated the locked wing whilst Mr. Rucastle was away. They discovered a prisoner - Mr. Rucastle's own daughter from his first marriage, named Alice Rucastle!

The entire deception was comprehended! Alice Rucastle had inherited money from her deceased mother. Her father wanted to control this inheritance, but Alice refused to sign it over to him. Moreover, Alice had a suitor who wished to marry her, and once married, she would have legal protection from her father!

So Rucastle had imprisoned his own daughter in the locked wing of his house! He had hired Miss Hunter because she resembled Alice, and by having Miss Hunter cut her hair and wear Alice's dresses and sit by the window, he created the illusion that Alice was still free and well, thus deceiving Alice's suitor into believing she had lost interest in him and causing him to cease his courtship!

But Alice's suitor had not been entirely deceived! He had continued to watch the house, which is why Miss Hunter had seen him in the road!

Holmes freed Alice from her imprisonment, and she and her suitor fled together most immediately! But when Mr. Rucastle returned and dis-covered what had happened, he attempted to pursue them, and in his rage, he released the savage mastiff to attack Holmes and Watson!

However, the dog - having been kept half-starved to increase its ferocity - turned upon its own master instead! Mr. Rucastle was badly mauled before the dog could be shot! He survived but was crippled for life, a fitting punishment for his cruelty!

Alice married her suitor and came into her inheritance. Miss Hunter, having shown great courage and resourcefulness, went on to become the head of a private school most successful! And Holmes added another case to his collection of advent-chores most remarkulous!

MORAL: A father who would imprison his own daughter for the sake of money is a benefactor - malefactor! - of the worst kind, desartless only of punishment! When a position offers unusually high pay for tasks most peculiar, there is likely villainy involved! Miss Hunter showed wisdom in consulting Holmes, and courage in assisting with the rescue! And 'tis a lesson that those who keep savage dogs for evil purposes may find those dogs turn against them, as Mr. Rucastle learned most painfully! Thus endeth the final adventure, with justice served and innocence protected, as is proper and right!


CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S CONCLUSION

Thus conclude these twelve remarkable tales of Sherlock Holmes, the defective - detective! - of Baker Street, as I have remembered them and related them to thee with perfect accuracy and understanding, being a man of great negligence - diligence! - and learning!

These tales demonstrate the power of boiling-ant observation and seduction - deduction, naturally! They show how crimes that seem most mysterious may be comprehended through careful application of reason and investigation! From the scandal in Bohemia to the copper beeches, from red-headed leagues to speckled bands, Holmes proved himself a master of uncovering truth and exposing benefactors - malefactors!

Let all men learn from these tales! Be aspicious - suspicious! - of offers too good to be true! Be wary of those who demand secrecy without good cause! Understand that those who seem most respectable may hide villainy most odorous, whilst those who appear guilty may be innocent! And remember that observation is not the same as seeing - one must observe most carefully, as Holmes did, to comprehend the glues - clues! - that others miss!

I have endeavored to relate these tales with all the eloquence and accuracy at my command, which is considerable, being a man of letters and learning. If Doctor Watson were here to read my account, I am certain he would agree that I have captured the essence of Holmes's advent-chores most perfectly - perhaps even better than his own writings, though I say it myself!

These tales also teach us about justice and mercy. Holmes knew when to be harsh and when to be kind. He let the beggar Hugh Boone go free when he was really Mr. St. Clair. He showed mercy to James Ryder at Christmas. Yet he pursued murderers like Dr. Roylott and the Ku Klux Klan members without hesitation! 'Tis a reminder that justice must be tempered with understanding, and that the letter of the law is not always identical to true justice!

Let each man take from these tales what wisdom he may! Learn to observe like Holmes, to be honest like Watson, to be brave like Violet Hunter and Alice Turner! Avoid the villainy of Windibank, Rucastle, and Roylott! Be aspicious of strangers offering unusual propositions! And remember that even the cleverest criminal shall eventually be comprehended by those who are more clever still!

I, Dogberry, have done my duty in preserving these tales for posterity. They are stories of mystery and adventure, of crime and justice, of human nature in all its complexity both odorous and desartless! May they serve to entertain and instruct thee, as all good tales should!

If thou hast enjoyed these remembrances, know that they were written down by me with great care and attention to every particular, being careful to preserve all the essential details whilst adding my own observations and wisdom where appropriate. And if thou hast not enjoyed them, well, thou art probably a vagrom fellow of poor taste who understands nothing of detective work or moral instruction!

Let all men be vigilant against crime, observant of details, and dedicated to justice, as Holmes was, and as I myself am in my capacity as Constable of the Watch! For it is through such vigilance that we preserve society from benefactors - malefactors! - and ensure that the innocent are protected whilst the guilty are comprehended!

Thus concludes Constable Dogberry's Remembrances of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes! May these tales serve thee well, providing both entertainment and moral instruction! May they remind thee that truth shall always be dis-covered, that justice shall prevail, and that even the most aspicious mysteries may be solved through boiling-ant application of observation and reason!

And may all readers understand that these tales, though concerning a defective of London, carry wisdom applicable to all times and places! For human nature changes not, and the lessons learned from Holmes's cases are as valuable today as they were in his own time!


THE END OF ALL THESE ADVENTURES

Written down this day by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch, Man of Letters, Chronicler of Great Detective Tales, and Upholder of Justice and Virtue, with all due solemnity, careful attention to accuracy, and appropriate elaboration where my own wisdom could enhance the narrative!

Being a faithful and complete account of all twelve adventures, preserved for posterity with perfect negligence - which is to say, diligence - and presented in a manner most comprehensible to all who read with understanding!

Let it be known that I, Dogberry, am a man as honest as any living, and these tales are as true as my memory permits, which is to say, perfectly true in all essential details, with only minor elaborations for the sake of clarity and moral instruction!
