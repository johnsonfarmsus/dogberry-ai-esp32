Now is the Winter of our Discontent, Made glorious Summer by this Son of Yorke: And all the clouds that lowr'd vpon our house In the deepe bosome of the Ocean buried. Now are our browes bound with Victorious Wreathes, Our bruised armes hung vp for Monuments; Our sterne Alarums chang'd to merry Meetings; Our dreadfull Marches, to delightfull Measures. Grim-visag'd Warre, hath smooth'd his wrinkled Front: And now, in stead of mounting Barbed Steeds, To fright the Soules of fearfull Aduersaries, He capers nimbly in a Ladies Chamber, To the lasciuious pleasing of a Lute. But I, that am not shap'd for sportiue trickes, Nor made to court an amorous Looking-glasse: I, that am Rudely stampt, and want loues Maiesty, To strut before a wonton ambling Nymph: I, that am curtail'd of this faire Proportion, Cheated of Feature by dissembling Nature, Deform'd, vn-finish'd, sent before my time Into this breathing World, scarse halfe made vp, And that so lamely and vnfashionable, That dogges barke at me, as I halt by them. Why I (in this weake piping time of Peace) Haue no delight to passe away the time, Vnlesse to see my Shadow in the Sunne, And descant on mine owne Deformity. And therefore, since I cannot proue a Louer, To entertaine these faire well spoken dayes, I am determined to proue a Villaine, And hate the idle pleasures of these dayes. Plots haue I laide, Inductions dangerous, By drunken Prophesies, Libels, and Dreames, To set my Brother Clarence and the King In deadly hate, the one against the other: And if King Edward be as true and iust, As I am Subtle, False, and Treacherous, This day should Clarence closely be mew'd vp: About a Prophesie, which sayes that G, Of Edwards heyres the murtherer shall be. Diue thoughts downe to my soule, here Clarence comes. Brother, good day: What meanes this armed guard That waites vpon your Grace? His Maiesty tendring my persons safety, Hath appointed this Conduct, to conuey me to th' Tower Vpon what cause? Because my name is George Alacke my Lord, that fault is none of yours: He should for that commit your Godfathers. O belike, his Maiesty hath some intent, That you should be new Christned in the Tower, But what's the matter Clarence, may I know? Yea Richard, when I know: but I protest As yet I do not: But as I can learne, He hearkens after Prophesies and Dreames, And from the Crosse-row pluckes the letter G: And sayes, a Wizard told him, that by G, His issue disinherited should be. And for my name of George begins with G, It followes in his thought, that I am he. These (as I learne) and such like toyes as these, Hath moou'd his Highnesse to commit me now Why this it is, when men are rul'd by Women: 'Tis not the King that sends you to the Tower, My Lady Grey his Wife, Clarence 'tis shee, That tempts him to this harsh Extremity. Was it not shee, and that good man of Worship, Anthony Woodeuile her Brother there, That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower? From whence this present day he is deliuered? We are not safe Clarence, we are not safe By heauen, I thinke there is no man secure But the Queenes Kindred, and night-walking Heralds, That trudge betwixt the King, and Mistris Shore. Heard you not what an humble Suppliant Lord Hastings was, for her deliuery? Humbly complaining to her Deitie, Got my Lord Chamberlaine his libertie. Ile tell you what, I thinke it is our way, If we will keepe in fauour with the King, To be her men, and weare her Liuery. The iealous ore-worne Widdow, and her selfe, Since that our Brother dub'd them Gentlewomen, Are mighty Gossips in our Monarchy I beseech your Graces both to pardon me, His Maiesty hath straightly giuen in charge, That no man shall haue priuate Conference (Of what degree soeuer) with your Brother Euen so, and please your Worship Brakenbury, You may partake of any thing we say: We speake no Treason man; We say the King Is wise and vertuous, and his Noble Queene Well strooke in yeares, faire, and not iealious. We say, that Shores Wife hath a pretty Foot, A cherry Lip, a bonny Eye, a passing pleasing tongue: And that the Queenes Kindred are made gentle Folkes. How say you sir? can you deny all this? With this (my Lord) my selfe haue nought to doo Naught to do with Mistris Shore? I tell thee Fellow, he that doth naught with her (Excepting one) were best to do it secretly alone What one, my Lord? Her Husband Knaue, would'st thou betray me? I do beseech your Grace To pardon me, and withall forbeare Your Conference with the Noble Duke We know thy charge Brakenbury, and wil obey We are the Queenes abiects, and must obey. Brother farewell, I will vnto the King, And whatsoe're you will imploy me in, Were it to call King Edwards Widdow, Sister, I will performe it to infranchise you. Meane time, this deepe disgrace in Brotherhood, Touches me deeper then you can imagine I know it pleaseth neither of vs well Well, your imprisonment shall not be long, I will deliuer you, or else lye for you: Meane time, haue patience I must perforce: Farewell. Go treade the path that thou shalt ne're return: Simple plaine Clarence, I do loue thee so, That I will shortly send thy Soule to Heauen, If Heauen will take the present at our hands. But who comes heere? the new deliuered Hastings? Good time of day vnto my gracious Lord As much vnto my good Lord Chamberlaine: Well are you welcome to this open Ayre, How hath your Lordship brook'd imprisonment? With patience (Noble Lord) as prisoners must: But I shall liue (my Lord) to giue them thankes That were the cause of my imprisonment No doubt, no doubt, and so shall Clarence too, For they that were your Enemies, are his, And haue preuail'd as much on him, as you, More pitty, that the Eagles should be mew'd, Whiles Kites and Buzards play at liberty What newes abroad? No newes so bad abroad, as this at home: The King is sickly, weake, and melancholly, And his Physitians feare him mightily Now by S. Iohn, that Newes is bad indeed. O he hath kept an euill Diet long, And ouer-much consum'd his Royall Person: 'Tis very greeuous to be thought vpon. Where is he, in his bed? He is Go you before, and I will follow you. He cannot liue I hope, and must not dye, Till George be pack'd with post-horse vp to Heauen. Ile in to vrge his hatred more to Clarence, With Lyes well steel'd with weighty Arguments, And if I faile not in my deepe intent, Clarence hath not another day to liue: Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy, And leaue the world for me to bussle in. For then, Ile marry Warwickes yongest daughter. What though I kill'd her Husband, and her Father, The readiest way to make the Wench amends, Is to become her Husband, and her Father: The which will I, not all so much for loue, As for another secret close intent, By marrying her, which I must reach vnto. But yet I run before my horse to Market: Clarence still breathes, Edward still liues and raignes, When they are gone, then must I count my gaines. Scena Secunda. Anne being the Mourner. Set downe, set downe your honourable load, If Honor may be shrowded in a Herse; Whil'st I a-while obsequiously lament Th' vntimely fall of Vertuous Lancaster. Poore key-cold Figure of a holy King, Pale Ashes of the House of Lancaster; Thou bloodlesse Remnant of that Royall Blood, Be it lawfull that I inuocate thy Ghost, To heare the Lamentations of poore Anne, Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughtred Sonne, Stab'd by the selfesame hand that made these wounds. Loe, in these windowes that let forth thy life, I powre the helplesse Balme of my poore eyes. O cursed be the hand that made these holes: Cursed the Heart, that had the heart to do it: Cursed the Blood, that let this blood from hence: More direfull hap betide that hated Wretch That makes vs wretched by the death of thee, Then I can wish to Wolues, to Spiders, Toades, Or any creeping venom'd thing that liues. If euer he haue Childe, Abortiue be it, Prodigeous, and vntimely brought to light, Whose vgly and vnnaturall Aspect May fright the hopefull Mother at the view, And that be Heyre to his vnhappinesse. If euer he haue Wife, let her be made More miserable by the death of him, Then I am made by my young Lord, and thee. Come now towards Chertsey with your holy Lode, Taken from Paules, to be interred there. And still as you are weary of this waight, Rest you, whiles I lament King Henries Coarse. Stay you that beare the Coarse, & set it down What blacke Magitian coniures vp this Fiend, To stop deuoted charitable deeds? Villaines set downe the Coarse, or by S. Paul, Ile make a Coarse of him that disobeyes My Lord stand backe, and let the Coffin passe Vnmanner'd Dogge, Stand'st thou when I commaund: Aduance thy Halbert higher then my brest, Or by S. Paul Ile strike thee to my Foote, And spurne vpon thee Begger for thy boldnesse What do you tremble? are you all affraid? Alas, I blame you not, for you are Mortall, And Mortall eyes cannot endure the Diuell. Auant thou dreadfull minister of Hell; Thou had'st but power ouer his Mortall body, His Soule thou canst not haue: Therefore be gone Sweet Saint, for Charity, be not so curst Foule Diuell, For Gods sake hence, and trouble vs not, For thou hast made the happy earth thy Hell: Fill'd it with cursing cries, and deepe exclaimes: If thou delight to view thy heynous deeds, Behold this patterne of thy Butcheries. Oh Gentlemen, see, see dead Henries wounds, Open their congeal'd mouthes, and bleed afresh. Blush, blush, thou lumpe of fowle Deformitie: For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood From cold and empty Veines where no blood dwels. Thy Deeds inhumane and vnnaturall, Prouokes this Deluge most vnnaturall. O God! which this Blood mad'st, reuenge his death: O Earth! which this Blood drink'st, reuenge his death. Either Heau'n with Lightning strike the murth'rer dead: Or Earth gape open wide, and eate him quicke, As thou dost swallow vp this good Kings blood, Which his Hell-gouern'd arme hath butchered Lady, you know no Rules of Charity, Which renders good for bad, Blessings for Curses Villaine, thou know'st nor law of God nor Man, No Beast so fierce, but knowes some touch of pitty But I know none, and therefore am no Beast O wonderfull, when diuels tell the truth! More wonderfull, when Angels are so angry: Vouchsafe (diuine perfection of a Woman) Of these supposed Crimes, to giue me leaue By circumstance, but to acquit my selfe Vouchsafe (defus'd infection of man) Of these knowne euils, but to giue me leaue By circumstance, to curse thy cursed Selfe Fairer then tongue can name thee, let me haue Some patient leysure to excuse my selfe Fouler then heart can thinke thee, Thou can'st make no excuse currant, But to hang thy selfe By such dispaire, I should accuse my selfe And by dispairing shalt thou stand excused, For doing worthy Vengeance on thy selfe, That did'st vnworthy slaughter vpon others Say that I slew them not Then say they were not slaine: But dead they are, and diuellish slaue by thee I did not kill your Husband Why then he is aliue Nay, he is dead, and slaine by Edwards hands In thy foule throat thou Ly'st, Queene Margaret saw Thy murd'rous Faulchion smoaking in his blood: The which, thou once didd'st bend against her brest, But that thy Brothers beate aside the point I was prouoked by her sland'rous tongue, That laid their guilt, vpon my guiltlesse Shoulders Thou was't prouoked by thy bloody minde, That neuer dream'st on ought but Butcheries: Did'st thou not kill this King? I graunt ye Do'st grant me Hedge-hogge, Then God graunt me too Thou may'st be damned for that wicked deede, O he was gentle, milde, and vertuous The better for the King of heauen that hath him He is in heauen, where thou shalt neuer come Let him thanke me, that holpe to send him thither: For he was fitter for that place then earth And thou vnfit for any place, but hell Yes one place else, if you will heare me name it Some dungeon Your Bed-chamber Ill rest betide the chamber where thou lyest So will it Madam, till I lye with you I hope so I know so. But gentle Lady Anne, To leaue this keene encounter of our wittes, And fall something into a slower method. Is not the causer of the timelesse deaths Of these Plantagenets, Henrie and Edward, As blamefull as the Executioner Thou was't the cause, and most accurst effect Your beauty was the cause of that effect: Your beauty, that did haunt me in my sleepe, To vndertake the death of all the world, So I might liue one houre in your sweet bosome If I thought that, I tell thee Homicide, These Nailes should rent that beauty from my Cheekes These eyes could not endure y beauties wrack, You should not blemish it, if I stood by; As all the world is cheared by the Sunne, So I by that: It is my day, my life Blacke night ore-shade thy day, & death thy life Curse not thy selfe faire Creature, Thou art both I would I were, to be reueng'd on thee It is a quarrell most vnnaturall, To be reueng'd on him that loueth thee It is a quarrell iust and reasonable, To be reueng'd on him that kill'd my Husband He that bereft the Lady of thy Husband, Did it to helpe thee to a better Husband His better doth not breath vpon the earth He liues, that loues thee better then he could Name him Plantagenet Why that was he The selfesame name, but one of better Nature Where is he? Heere: Spits at him. Why dost thou spit at me Would it were mortall poyson, for thy sake Neuer came poyson from so sweet a place Neuer hung poyson on a fowler Toade. Out of my sight, thou dost infect mine eyes Thine eyes (sweet Lady) haue infected mine Would they were Basiliskes, to strike thee dead I would they were, that I might dye at once: For now they kill me with a liuing death. Those eyes of thine, from mine haue drawne salt Teares; Sham'd their Aspects with store of childish drops: These eyes, which neuer shed remorsefull teare, No, when my Father Yorke, and Edward wept, To heare the pittious moane that Rutland made When black-fac'd Clifford shooke his sword at him. Nor when thy warlike Father like a Childe, Told the sad storie of my Fathers death, And twenty times, made pause to sob and weepe: That all the standers by had wet their cheekes Like Trees bedash'd with raine. In that sad time, My manly eyes did scorne an humble teare: And what these sorrowes could not thence exhale, Thy Beauty hath, and made them blinde with weeping. I neuer sued to Friend, nor Enemy: My Tongue could neuer learne sweet smoothing word. But now thy Beauty is propos'd my Fee, My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speake. She lookes scornfully at him. Teach not thy lip such Scorne; for it was made For kissing Lady, not for such contempt. If thy reuengefull heart cannot forgiue, Loe heere I lend thee this sharpe-pointed Sword, Which if thou please to hide in this true brest, And let the Soule forth that adoreth thee, I lay it naked to the deadly stroke, And humbly begge the death vpon my knee, He layes his brest open, she offers at with his sword. Nay do not pause: For I did kill King Henrie, But 'twas thy Beauty that prouoked me. Nay now dispatch: 'Twas I that stabb'd yong Edward, But 'twas thy Heauenly face that set me on. She fals the Sword. Take vp the Sword againe, or take vp me Arise Dissembler, though I wish thy death, I will not be thy Executioner Then bid me kill my selfe, and I will do it I haue already That was in thy rage: Speake it againe, and euen with the word, This hand, which for thy loue, did kill thy Loue, Shall for thy loue, kill a farre truer Loue, To both their deaths shalt thou be accessary I would I knew thy heart 'Tis figur'd in my tongue I feare me, both are false Then neuer Man was true Well, well, put vp your Sword Say then my Peace is made That shalt thou know heereafter But shall I liue in hope All men I hope liue so. Vouchsafe to weare this Ring Looke how my Ring incompasseth thy Finger, Euen so thy Brest incloseth my poore heart: Weare both of them, for both of them are thine. And if thy poore deuoted Seruant may But beg one fauour at thy gracious hand, Thou dost confirme his happinesse for euer What is it? That it may please you leaue these sad designes, To him that hath most cause to be a Mourner, And presently repayre to Crosbie House: Where (after I haue solemnly interr'd At Chertsey Monast'ry this Noble King, And wet his Graue with my Repentant Teares) I will with all expedient duty see you, For diuers vnknowne Reasons, I beseech you, Grant me this Boon With all my heart, and much it ioyes me too, To see you are become so penitent. Tressel and Barkley, go along with me Bid me farwell 'Tis more then you deserue: But since you teach me how to flatter you, Imagine I haue saide farewell already. Towards Chertsey, Noble Lord? No: to White Friars, there attend my comming Was euer woman in this humour woo'd? Was euer woman in this humour wonne? Ile haue her, but I will not keepe her long. What? I that kill'd her Husband, and his Father, To take her in her hearts extreamest hate, With curses in her mouth, Teares in her eyes, The bleeding witnesse of my hatred by, Hauing God, her Conscience, and these bars against me, And I, no Friends to backe my suite withall, But the plaine Diuell, and dissembling lookes? And yet to winne her? All the world to nothing. Hah! Hath she forgot alreadie that braue Prince, Edward, her Lord, whom I (some three monthes since) Stab'd in my angry mood, at Tewkesbury? A sweeter, and a louelier Gentleman, Fram'd in the prodigallity of Nature: Yong, Valiant, Wise, and (no doubt) right Royal, The spacious World cannot againe affoord: And will she yet abase her eyes on me, That cropt the Golden prime of this sweet Prince, And made her Widdow to a wofull Bed? On me, whose All not equals Edwards Moytie? On me, that halts, and am mishapen thus? My Dukedome, to a Beggerly denier! I do mistake my person all this while: Vpon my life she findes (although I cannot) My selfe to be a maru'llous proper man. Ile be at Charges for a Looking-glasse, And entertaine a score or two of Taylors, To study fashions to adorne my body: Since I am crept in fauour with my selfe, I will maintaine it with some little cost. But first Ile turne yon Fellow in his Graue, And then returne lamenting to my Loue. Shine out faire Sunne, till I haue bought a glasse, That I may see my Shadow as I passe. Scena Tertia. Haue patience Madam, ther's no doubt his Maiesty Will soone recouer his accustom'd health In that you brooke it ill, it makes him worse, Therefore for Gods sake entertaine good comfort, And cheere his Grace with quicke and merry eyes If he were dead, what would betide on me? If he were dead, what would betide on me? No other harme, but losse of such a Lord The losse of such a Lord, includes all harmes The Heauens haue blest you with a goodly Son, To be your Comforter, when he is gone Ah! he is yong; and his minority Is put vnto the trust of Richard Glouster, A man that loues not me, nor none of you Is it concluded he shall be Protector? It is determin'd, not concluded yet: But so it must be, if the King miscarry. Here comes the Lord of Buckingham & Derby Good time of day vnto your Royall Grace God make your Maiesty ioyful, as you haue bin The Countesse Richmond, good my L. of Derby. To your good prayer, will scarsely say, Amen. Yet Derby, not withstanding shee's your wife, And loues not me, be you good Lord assur'd, I hate not you for her proud arrogance I do beseech you, either not beleeue The enuious slanders of her false Accusers: Or if she be accus'd on true report, Beare with her weaknesse, which I thinke proceeds From wayward sicknesse, and no grounded malice Saw you the King to day my Lord of Derby But now the Duke of Buckingham and I, Are come from visiting his Maiesty What likelyhood of his amendment Lords Madam good hope, his Grace speaks chearfully God grant him health, did you confer with him? I Madam, he desires to make attonement Betweene the Duke of Glouster, and your Brothers, And betweene them, and my Lord Chamberlaine, And sent to warne them to his Royall presence Would all were well, but that will neuer be, I feare our happinesse is at the height. They do me wrong, and I will not indure it, Who is it that complaines vnto the King, That I (forsooth) am sterne, and loue them not? By holy Paul, they loue his Grace but lightly, That fill his eares with such dissentious Rumors. Because I cannot flatter, and looke faire, Smile in mens faces, smooth, deceiue, and cogge, Ducke with French nods, and Apish curtesie, I must be held a rancorous Enemy. Cannot a plaine man liue, and thinke no harme, But thus his simple truth must be abus'd, With silken, slye, insinuating Iackes? To who in all this presence speaks your Grace? To thee, that hast nor Honesty, nor Grace: When haue I iniur'd thee? When done thee wrong? Or thee? or thee? or any of your Faction? A plague vpon you all. His Royall Grace (Whom God preserue better then you would wish) Cannot be quiet scarse a breathing while, But you must trouble him with lewd complaints Brother of Glouster, you mistake the matter: The King on his owne Royall disposition, (And not prouok'd by any Sutor else) Ayming (belike) at your interiour hatred, That in your outward action shewes it selfe Against my Children, Brothers, and my Selfe, Makes him to send, that he may learne the ground I cannot tell, the world is growne so bad, That Wrens make prey, where Eagles dare not pearch. Since euerie Iacke became a Gentleman, There's many a gentle person made a Iacke Come, come, we know your meaning Brother Gloster You enuy my aduancement, and my friends: God grant we neuer may haue neede of you Meane time, God grants that I haue need of you. Our Brother is imprison'd by your meanes, My selfe disgrac'd, and the Nobilitie Held in contempt, while great Promotions Are daily giuen to ennoble those That scarse some two dayes since were worth a Noble By him that rais'd me to this carefull height, From that contented hap which I inioy'd, I neuer did incense his Maiestie Against the Duke of Clarence, but haue bin An earnest aduocate to plead for him. My Lord you do me shamefull iniurie, Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects You may deny that you were not the meane Of my Lord Hastings late imprisonment She may my Lord, for- She may Lord Riuers, why who knowes not so? She may do more sir then denying that: She may helpe you to many faire preferments, And then deny her ayding hand therein, And lay those Honors on your high desert. What may she not, she may, I marry may she What marry may she? What marrie may she? Marrie with a King, A Batcheller, and a handsome stripling too, Iwis your Grandam had a worser match My Lord of Glouster, I haue too long borne Your blunt vpbraidings, and your bitter scoffes: By heauen, I will acquaint his Maiestie Of those grosse taunts that oft I haue endur'd. I had rather be a Countrie seruant maide Then a great Queene, with this condition, To be so baited, scorn'd, and stormed at, Small ioy haue I in being Englands Queene. And lesned be that small, God I beseech him, Thy honor, state, and seate, is due to me What? threat you me with telling of the King? I will auouch't in presence of the King: I dare aduenture to be sent to th' Towre. 'Tis time to speake, My paines are quite forgot Out Diuell, I do remember them too well: Thou killd'st my Husband Henrie in the Tower, And Edward my poore Son, at Tewkesburie Ere you were Queene, I, or your Husband King: I was a packe-horse in his great affaires: A weeder out of his proud Aduersaries, A liberall rewarder of his Friends, To royalize his blood, I spent mine owne I and much better blood Then his, or thine In all which time, you and your Husband Grey Were factious, for the House of Lancaster; And Riuers, so were you: Was not your Husband, In Margarets Battaile, at Saint Albons, slaine? Let me put in your mindes, if you forget What you haue beene ere this, and what you are: Withall, what I haue beene, and what I am M. A murth'rous Villaine, and so still thou art Poore Clarence did forsake his Father Warwicke, I, and forswore himselfe (which Iesu pardon.) M. Which God reuenge To fight on Edwards partie, for the Crowne, And for his meede, poore Lord, he is mewed vp: I would to God my heart were Flint, like Edwards, Or Edwards soft and pittifull, like mine; I am too childish foolish for this World M. High thee to Hell for shame, & leaue this World Thou Cacodemon, there thy Kingdome is My Lord of Gloster: in those busie dayes, Which here you vrge, to proue vs Enemies, We follow'd then our Lord, our Soueraigne King, So should we you, if you should be our King If I should be? I had rather be a Pedler: Farre be it from my heart, the thought thereof As little ioy (my Lord) as you suppose You should enioy, were you this Countries King, As little ioy you may suppose in me, That I enioy, being the Queene thereof M. A little ioy enioyes the Queene thereof, For I am shee, and altogether ioylesse: I can no longer hold me patient. Heare me, you wrangling Pyrates, that fall out, In sharing that which you haue pill'd from me: Which off you trembles not, that lookes on me? If not, that I am Queene, you bow like Subiects; Yet that by you depos'd, you quake like Rebells. Ah gentle Villaine, doe not turne away Foule wrinckled Witch, what mak'st thou in my sight? M. But repetition of what thou hast marr'd, That will I make, before I let thee goe Wert thou not banished, on paine of death? M. I was: but I doe find more paine in banishment, Then death can yeeld me here, by my abode. A Husband and a Sonne thou ow'st to me, And thou a Kingdome; all of you, allegeance: This Sorrow that I haue, by right is yours, And all the Pleasures you vsurpe, are mine The Curse my Noble Father layd on thee, When thou didst Crown his Warlike Brows with Paper, And with thy scornes drew'st Riuers from his eyes, And then to dry them, gau'st the Duke a Clowt, Steep'd in the faultlesse blood of prettie Rutland: His Curses then, from bitternesse of Soule, Denounc'd against thee, are all falne vpon thee: And God, not we, hath plagu'd thy bloody deed So iust is God, to right the innocent O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that Babe, And the most mercilesse, that ere was heard of Tyrants themselues wept when it was reported No man but prophecied reuenge for it Northumberland, then present, wept to see it M. What? were you snarling all before I came, Ready to catch each other by the throat, And turne you all your hatred now on me? Did Yorkes dread Curse preuaile so much with Heauen, That Henries death, my louely Edwards death, Their Kingdomes losse, my wofull Banishment, Should all but answer for that peeuish Brat? Can Curses pierce the Clouds, and enter Heauen? Why then giue way dull Clouds to my quick Curses. Though not by Warre, by Surfet dye your King, As ours by Murther, to make him a King. Edward thy Sonne, that now is Prince of Wales, For Edward our Sonne, that was Prince of Wales, Dye in his youth, by like vntimely violence. Thy selfe a Queene, for me that was a Queene, Out-liue thy glory, like my wretched selfe: Long may'st thou liue, to wayle thy Childrens death, And see another, as I see thee now, Deck'd in thy Rights, as thou art stall'd in mine. Long dye thy happie dayes, before thy death, And after many length'ned howres of griefe, Dye neyther Mother, Wife, nor Englands Queene. Riuers and Dorset, you were standers by, And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my Sonne Was stab'd with bloody Daggers: God, I pray him, That none of you may liue his naturall age, But by some vnlook'd accident cut off Haue done thy Charme, y hateful wither'd Hagge M. And leaue out thee? stay Dog, for y shalt heare me. If Heauen haue any grieuous plague in store, Exceeding those that I can wish vpon thee, O let them keepe it, till thy sinnes be ripe, And then hurle downe their indignation On thee, the troubler of the poore Worlds peace. The Worme of Conscience still begnaw thy Soule, Thy Friends suspect for Traytors while thou liu'st, And take deepe Traytors for thy dearest Friends: No sleepe close vp that deadly Eye of thine, Vnlesse it be while some tormenting Dreame Affrights thee with a Hell of ougly Deuills. Thou eluish mark'd, abortiue rooting Hogge, Thou that wast seal'd in thy Natiuitie The slaue of Nature, and the Sonne of Hell: Thou slander of thy heauie Mothers Wombe, Thou loathed Issue of thy Fathers Loynes, Thou Ragge of Honor, thou detested- Margaret M. Richard Ha M. I call thee not I cry thee mercie then: for I did thinke, That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names M. Why so I did, but look'd for no reply. Oh let me make the Period to my Curse 'Tis done by me and ends in Margaret Thus haue you breath'd your Curse against your self M. Poore painted Queen, vain flourish of my fortune, Why strew'st thou Sugar on that Bottel'd Spider, Whose deadly Web ensnareth thee about? Foole, foole, thou whet'st a Knife to kill thy selfe: The day will come, that thou shalt wish for me, To helpe thee curse this poysonous Bunch-backt Toade False boding Woman, end thy frantick Curse, Least to thy harme, thou moue our patience M. Foule shame vpon you, you haue all mou'd mine Were you wel seru'd, you would be taught your duty M. To serue me well, you all should do me duty, Teach me to be your Queene, and you my Subiects: O serue me well, and teach your selues that duty Dispute not with her, shee is lunaticke M. Peace Master Marquesse, you are malapert, Your fire-new stampe of Honor is scarce currant. O that your yong Nobility could iudge What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable. They that stand high, haue many blasts to shake them, And if they fall, they dash themselues to peeces Good counsaile marry, learne it, learne it Marquesse It touches you my Lord, as much as me I, and much more: but I was borne so high: Our ayerie buildeth in the Cedars top, And dallies with the winde, and scornes the Sunne And turnes the Sun to shade: alas, alas, Witnesse my Sonne, now in the shade of death, Whose bright out-shining beames, thy cloudy wrath Hath in eternall darknesse folded vp. Your ayery buildeth in our ayeries Nest: O God that seest it, do not suffer it, As it is wonne with blood, lost be it so Peace, peace for shame: If not, for Charity Vrge neither charity, nor shame to me: Vncharitably with me haue you dealt, And shamefully my hopes (by you) are butcher'd. My Charity is outrage, Life my shame, And in that shame, still liue my sorrowes rage Haue done, haue done O Princely Buckingham, Ile kisse thy hand, In signe of League and amity with thee: Now faire befall thee, and thy Noble house: Thy Garments are not spotted with our blood: Nor thou within the compasse of my curse Nor no one heere: for Curses neuer passe The lips of those that breath them in the ayre I will not thinke but they ascend the sky, And there awake Gods gentle sleeping peace. O Buckingham, take heede of yonder dogge: Looke when he fawnes, he bites; and when he bites, His venom tooth will rankle to the death. Haue not to do with him, beware of him, Sinne, death, and hell haue set their markes on him, And all their Ministers attend on him What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham Nothing that I respect my gracious Lord What dost thou scorne me For my gentle counsell? And sooth the diuell that I warne thee from. O but remember this another day: When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow: And say (poore Margaret) was a Prophetesse: Liue each of you the subiects to his hate, And he to yours, and all of you to Gods. My haire doth stand an end to heare her curses And so doth mine, I muse why she's at libertie I cannot blame her, by Gods holy mother, She hath had too much wrong, and I repent My part thereof, that I haue done to her I neuer did her any to my knowledge Yet you haue all the vantage of her wrong: I was too hot, to do somebody good, That is too cold in thinking of it now: Marry as for Clarence, he is well repayed: He is frank'd vp to fatting for his paines, God pardon them, that are the cause thereof A vertuous, and a Christian-like conclusion To pray for them that haue done scath to vs So do I euer, being well aduis'd. Speakes to himselfe. For had I curst now, I had curst my selfe. Madam, his Maiesty doth call for you, And for your Grace, and yours my gracious Lord Catesby I come, Lords will you go with mee We wait vpon your Grace. I do the wrong, and first begin to brawle. The secret Mischeefes that I set abroach, I lay vnto the greeuous charge of others. Clarence, who I indeede haue cast in darknesse, I do beweepe to many simple Gulles, Namely to Derby, Hastings, Buckingham, And tell them 'tis the Queene, and her Allies, That stirre the King against the Duke my Brother. Now they beleeue it, and withall whet me To be reueng'd on Riuers, Dorset, Grey. But then I sigh, and with a peece of Scripture, Tell them that God bids vs do good for euill: And thus I cloath my naked Villanie With odde old ends, stolne forth of holy Writ, And seeme a Saint, when most I play the deuill. But soft, heere come my Executioners, How now my hardy stout resolued Mates, Are you now going to dispatch this thing? We are my Lord, and come to haue the Warrant, That we may be admitted where he is Well thought vpon, I haue it heare about me: When you haue done, repayre to Crosby place; But sirs be sodaine in the execution, Withall obdurate, do not heare him pleade; For Clarence is well spoken, and perhappes May moue your hearts to pitty, if you marke him Tut, tut, my Lord, we will not stand to prate, Talkers are no good dooers, be assur'd: We go to vse our hands, and not our tongues Your eyes drop Mill-stones, when Fooles eyes fall Teares: I like you Lads, about your businesse straight. Go, go, dispatch We will my Noble Lord. Scena Quarta. Why lookes your Grace so heauily to day O, I haue past a miserable night, So full of fearefull Dreames, of vgly sights, That as I am a Christian faithfull man, I would not spend another such a night Though 'twere to buy a world of happy daies: So full of dismall terror was the time What was your dream my Lord, I pray you tel me Me thoughts that I had broken from the Tower, And was embark'd to crosse to Burgundy, And in my company my Brother Glouster, Who from my Cabin tempted me to walke, Vpon the Hatches: There we look'd toward England, And cited vp a thousand heauy times, During the warres of Yorke and Lancaster That had befalne vs. As we pac'd along Vpon the giddy footing of the Hatches, Me thought that Glouster stumbled, and in falling Strooke me (that thought to stay him) ouer-boord, Into the tumbling billowes of the maine. O Lord, me thought what paine it was to drowne, What dreadfull noise of water in mine eares, What sights of vgly death within mine eyes. Me thoughts, I saw a thousand fearfull wrackes: A thousand men that Fishes gnaw'd vpon: Wedges of Gold, great Anchors, heapes of Pearle, Inestimable Stones, vnvalewed Iewels, All scattred in the bottome of the Sea, Some lay in dead-mens Sculles, and in the holes Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept (As 'twere in scorne of eyes) reflecting Gemmes, That woo'd the slimy bottome of the deepe, And mock'd the dead bones that lay scattred by Had you such leysure in the time of death To gaze vpon these secrets of the deepe? Me thought I had, and often did I striue To yeeld the Ghost: but still the enuious Flood Stop'd in my soule, and would not let it forth To find the empty, vast, and wand'ring ayre: But smother'd it within my panting bulke, Who almost burst, to belch it in the Sea Awak'd you not in this sore Agony? No, no, my Dreame was lengthen'd after life. O then, began the Tempest to my Soule. I past (me thought) the Melancholly Flood, With that sowre Ferry-man which Poets write of, Vnto the Kingdome of perpetuall Night. The first that there did greet my Stranger-soule, Was my great Father-in-Law, renowned Warwicke, Who spake alowd: What scourge for Periurie, Can this darke Monarchy affoord false Clarence? And so he vanish'd. Then came wand'ring by, A Shadow like an Angell, with bright hayre Dabbel'd in blood, and he shriek'd out alowd Clarence is come, false, fleeting, periur'd Clarence, That stabb'd me in the field by Tewkesbury: Seize on him Furies, take him vnto Torment. With that (me thought) a Legion of foule Fiends Inuiron'd me, and howled in mine eares Such hiddeous cries, that with the very Noise, I (trembling) wak'd, and for a season after, Could not beleeue, but that I was in Hell, Such terrible Impression made my Dreame No maruell Lord, though it affrighted you, I am affraid (me thinkes) to heare you tell it Ah Keeper, Keeper, I haue done these things (That now giue euidence against my Soule) For Edwards sake, and see how he requits mee. O God! if my deepe prayres cannot appease thee, But thou wilt be aueng'd on my misdeeds, Yet execute thy wrath in me alone: O spare my guiltlesse Wife, and my poore children. Keeper, I prythee sit by me a-while, My Soule is heauy, and I faine would sleepe I will my Lord, God giue your Grace good rest. Sorrow breakes Seasons, and reposing houres, Makes the Night Morning, and the Noon-tide night: Princes haue but their Titles for their Glories, An outward Honor, for an inward Toyle, And for vnfelt Imaginations They often feele a world of restlesse Cares: So that betweene their Titles, and low Name, There's nothing differs, but the outward fame. 1.Mur. Ho, who's heere? What would'st thou Fellow? And how camm'st thou hither 2.Mur. I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my Legges What so breefe? 1. 'Tis better (Sir) then to be tedious: Let him see our Commission, and talke no more. Reads I am in this, commanded to deliuer The Noble Duke of Clarence to your hands. I will not reason what is meant heereby, Because I will be guiltlesse from the meaning. There lies the Duke asleepe, and there the Keyes. Ile to the King, and signifie to him, That thus I haue resign'd to you my charge. 1 You may sir, 'tis a point of wisedome: Far you well 2 What, shall we stab him as he sleepes 1 No: hee'l say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes 2 Why he shall neuer wake, vntill the great Iudgement day 1 Why then hee'l say, we stab'd him sleeping 2 The vrging of that word Iudgement, hath bred a kinde of remorse in me 1 What? art thou affraid? 2 Not to kill him, hauing a Warrant, But to be damn'd for killing him, from the which No Warrant can defend me 1 I thought thou had'st bin resolute 2 So I am, to let him liue 1 Ile backe to the Duke of Glouster, and tell him so 2 Nay, I prythee stay a little: I hope this passionate humor of mine, will change, It was wont to hold me but while one tels twenty 1 How do'st thou feele thy selfe now? 2 Some certaine dregges of conscience are yet within mee 1 Remember our Reward, when the deed's done 2 Come, he dies: I had forgot the Reward 1 Where's thy conscience now 2 O, in the Duke of Glousters purse 1 When hee opens his purse to giue vs our Reward, thy Conscience flyes out 2 'Tis no matter, let it goe: There's few or none will 1 What if it come to thee againe? 2 Ile not meddle with it, it makes a man a Coward: A man cannot steale, but it accuseth him: A man cannot Sweare, but it Checkes him: A man cannot lye with his Neighbours Wife, but it detects him. 'Tis a blushing shamefac'd spirit, that mutinies in a mans bosome: It filles a man full of Obstacles. It made me once restore a Pursse of Gold that (by chance) I found: It beggars any man that keepes it: It is turn'd out of Townes and Citties for a dangerous thing, and euery man that means to liue well, endeuours to trust to himselfe, and liue without it 1 'Tis euen now at my elbow, perswading me not to kill the Duke 2 Take the diuell in thy minde, and beleeue him not: He would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh 1 I am strong fram'd, he cannot preuaile with me 2 Spoke like a tall man, that respects thy reputation. Come, shall we fall to worke? 1 Take him on the Costard, with the hiltes of thy Sword, and then throw him into the Malmesey-Butte in the next roome 2 O excellent deuice; and make a sop of him 1 Soft, he wakes 2 Strike 1 No, wee'l reason with him Where art thou Keeper? Giue me a cup of wine 2 You shall haue Wine enough my Lord anon In Gods name, what art thou? 1 A man, as you are But not as I am Royall 1 Nor you as we are, Loyall Thy voice is Thunder, but thy looks are humble 1 My voice is now the Kings, my lookes mine owne How darkly, and how deadly dost thou speake? Your eyes do menace me: why looke you pale? Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come? 2 To, to, to- To murther me? You scarsely haue the hearts to tell me so, And therefore cannot haue the hearts to do it. Wherein my Friends haue I offended you? 1 Offended vs you haue not, but the King I shall be reconcil'd to him againe 2 Neuer my Lord, therefore prepare to dye Are you drawne forth among a world of men To slay the innocent? What is my offence? Where is the Euidence that doth accuse me? What lawfull Quest haue giuen their Verdict vp Vnto the frowning Iudge? Or who pronounc'd The bitter sentence of poore Clarence death, Before I be conuict by course of Law? To threaten me with death, is most vnlawfull. I charge you, as you hope for any goodnesse, That you depart, and lay no hands on me: The deed you vndertake is damnable 1 What we will do, we do vpon command 2 And he that hath commanded, is our King Erroneous Vassals, the great King of Kings Hath in the Table of his Law commanded That thou shalt do no murther. Will you then Spurne at his Edict, and fulfill a Mans? Take heed: for he holds Vengeance in his hand, To hurle vpon their heads that breake his Law 2 And that same Vengeance doth he hurle on thee, For false Forswearing, and for murther too: Thou did'st receiue the Sacrament, to fight In quarrell of the House of Lancaster 1 And like a Traitor to the name of God, Did'st breake that Vow, and with thy treacherous blade, Vnrip'st the Bowels of thy Sou'raignes Sonne 2 Whom thou was't sworne to cherish and defend 1 How canst thou vrge Gods dreadfull Law to vs, When thou hast broke it in such deere degree? Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deede? For Edward, for my Brother, for his sake. He sends you not to murther me for this: For in that sinne, he is as deepe as I. If God will be auenged for the deed, O know you yet, he doth it publiquely, Take not the quarrell from his powrefull arme: He needs no indirect, or lawlesse course, To cut off those that haue offended him 1 Who made thee then a bloudy minister, When gallant springing braue Plantagenet, That Princely Nouice was strucke dead by thee? My Brothers loue, the Diuell, and my Rage 1 Thy Brothers Loue, our Duty, and thy Faults, Prouoke vs hither now, to slaughter thee If you do loue my Brother, hate not me: I am his Brother, and I loue him well. If you are hyr'd for meed, go backe againe, And I will send you to my Brother Glouster: Who shall reward you better for my life, Then Edward will for tydings of my death 2 You are deceiu'd, Your Brother Glouster hates you Oh no, he loues me, and he holds me deere: Go you to him from me 1 I so we will Tell him, when that our Princely Father Yorke, Blest his three Sonnes with his victorious Arme, He little thought of this diuided Friendship: Bid Glouster thinke on this, and he will weepe 1 I Milstones, as he lessoned vs to weepe O do not slander him, for he is kinde 1 Right, as Snow in Haruest: Come, you deceiue your selfe, 'Tis he that sends vs to destroy you heere It cannot be, for he bewept my Fortune, And hugg'd me in his armes, and swore with sobs, That he would labour my deliuery 1 Why so he doth, when he deliuers you From this earths thraldome, to the ioyes of heauen 2 Make peace with God, for you must die my Lord Haue you that holy feeling in your soules, To counsaile me to make my peace with God, And are you yet to your owne soules so blinde, That you will warre with God, by murd'ring me. O sirs consider, they that set you on To do this deede will hate you for the deede 2 What shall we do? Relent, and saue your soules: Which of you, if you were a Princes Sonne, Being pent from Liberty, as I am now, If two such murtherers as your selues came to you, Would not intreat for life, as you would begge Were you in my distresse 1 Relent? no: 'Tis cowardly and womanish Not to relent, is beastly, sauage, diuellish: My Friend, I spy some pitty in thy lookes: O, if thine eye be not a Flatterer, Come thou on my side, and intreate for mee, A begging Prince, what begger pitties not 2 Looke behinde you, my Lord 1 Take that, and that, if all this will not do, Stabs him. Ile drowne you in the MalmeseyBut within. 2 A bloody deed, and desperately dispatcht: How faine (like Pilate) would I wash my hands Of this most greeuous murther. 1 How now? what mean'st thou that thou help'st me not? By Heauen the Duke shall know how slacke you haue beene 2.Mur. I would he knew that I had sau'd his brother, Take thou the Fee, and tell him what I say, For I repent me that the Duke is slaine. 1.Mur. So do not I: go Coward as thou art. Well, Ile go hide the body in some hole, Till that the Duke giue order for his buriall: And when I haue my meede, I will away, For this will out, and then I must not stay. Hastings, Catesby, Buckingham, Wooduill. Why so: now haue I done a good daies work. You Peeres, continue this vnited League: I, euery day expect an Embassage From my Redeemer, to redeeme me hence. And more to peace my soule shall part to heauen, Since I haue made my Friends at peace on earth. Dorset and Riuers, take each others hand, Dissemble not your hatred, Sweare your loue By heauen, my soule is purg'd from grudging hate And with my hand I seale my true hearts Loue So thriue I, as I truly sweare the like Take heed you dally not before your King, Lest he that is the supreme King of Kings Confound your hidden falshood, and award Either of you to be the others end So prosper I, as I sweare perfect loue And I, as I loue Hastings with my heart, Madam, your selfe is not exempt from this: Nor you Sonne Dorset, Buckingham nor you; You haue bene factious one against the other. Wife, loue Lord Hastings, let him kisse your hand, And what you do, do it vnfeignedly There Hastings, I will neuer more remember Our former hatred, so thriue I, and mine Dorset, imbrace him: Hastings, loue Lord Marquesse This interchange of loue, I heere protest Vpon my part, shall be inuiolable And so sweare I Now Princely Buckingham, seale y this league With thy embracements to my wiues Allies, And make me happy in your vnity When euer Buckingham doth turne his hate Vpon your Grace, but with all dutious loue, Doth cherish you, and yours, God punish me With hate in those where I expect most loue, When I haue most need to imploy a Friend, And most assured that he is a Friend, Deepe, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile, Be he vnto me: This do I begge of heauen, When I am cold in loue, to you, or yours. Embrace A pleasing Cordiall, Princely Buckingham Is this thy Vow, vnto my sickely heart: There wanteth now our Brother Gloster heere, To make the blessed period of this peace And in good time, Heere comes Sir Richard Ratcliffe, and the Duke. Good morrow to my Soueraigne King & Queen And Princely Peeres, a happy time of day Happy indeed, as we haue spent the day: Gloster, we haue done deeds of Charity, Made peace of enmity, faire loue of hate, Betweene these swelling wrong incensed Peeres A blessed labour my most Soueraigne Lord: Among this Princely heape, if any heere By false intelligence, or wrong surmize Hold me a Foe: If I vnwillingly, or in my rage, Haue ought committed that is hardly borne, To any in this presence, I desire To reconcile me to his Friendly peace: 'Tis death to me to be at enmitie: I hate it, and desire all good mens loue, First Madam, I intreate true peace of you, Which I will purchase with my dutious seruice. Of you my Noble Cosin Buckingham, If euer any grudge were lodg'd betweene vs. Of you and you, Lord Riuers and of Dorset, That all without desert haue frown'd on me: Of you Lord Wooduill, and Lord Scales of you, Dukes, Earles, Lords, Gentlemen, indeed of all. I do not know that Englishman aliue, With whom my soule is any iot at oddes, More then the Infant that is borne to night: I thanke my God for my Humility A holy day shall this be kept heereafter: I would to God all strifes were well compounded. My Soueraigne Lord, I do beseech your Highnesse To take our Brother Clarence to your Grace Why Madam, haue I offred loue for this, To be so flowted in this Royall presence? Who knowes not that the gentle Duke is dead? They all start. You do him iniurie to scorne his Coarse Who knowes not he is dead? Who knowes he is? All-seeing heauen, what a world is this? Looke I so pale Lord Dorset, as the rest? I my good Lord, and no man in the presence, But his red colour hath forsooke his cheekes Is Clarence dead? The Order was reuerst But he (poore man) by your first order dyed, And that a winged Mercurie did beare: Some tardie Cripple bare the Countermand, That came too lagge to see him buried. God grant, that some lesse Noble, and lesse Loyall, Neerer in bloody thoughts, and not in blood, Deserue not worse then wretched Clarence did, And yet go currant from Suspition. A boone my Soueraigne for my seruice done I prethee peace, my soule is full of sorrow I will not rise, vnlesse your Highnes heare me Then say at once, what is it thou requests The forfeit (Soueraigne) of my seruants life, Who slew to day a Riotous Gentleman, Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolke Haue I a tongue to doome my Brothers death? And shall that tongue giue pardon to a slaue? My Brother kill'd no man, his fault was Thought, And yet his punishment was bitter death. Who sued to me for him? Who (in my wrath) Kneel'd and my feet, and bid me be aduis'd? Who spoke of Brother-hood? who spoke of loue? Who told me how the poore soule did forsake The mighty Warwicke, and did fight for me? Who told me in the field at Tewkesbury, When Oxford had me downe, he rescued me: And said deare Brother liue, and be a King? Who told me, when we both lay in the Field, Frozen (almost) to death, how he did lap me Euen in his Garments, and did giue himselfe (All thin and naked) to the numbe cold night? All this from my Remembrance, brutish wrath Sinfully pluckt, and not a man of you Had so much grace to put it in my minde. But when your Carters, or your wayting Vassalls Haue done a drunken Slaughter, and defac'd The precious Image of our deere Redeemer, You straight are on your knees for Pardon, pardon, And I (vniustly too) must grant it you. But for my Brother, not a man would speake, Nor I (vngracious) speake vnto my selfe For him poore Soule. The proudest of you all, Haue bin beholding to him in his life: Yet none of you, would once begge for his life. O God! I feare thy iustice will take hold On me, and you; and mine, and yours for this. Come Hastings helpe me to my Closset. Ah poore Clarence. This is the fruits of rashnes: Markt you not, How that the guilty Kindred of the Queene Look'd pale, when they did heare of Clarence death. O! they did vrge it still vnto the King, God will reuenge it. Come Lords will you go, To comfort Edward with our company We wait vpon your Grace. Scena Secunda. Good Grandam tell vs, is our Father dead? No Boy Why do weepe so oft? And beate your Brest? And cry, O Clarence, my vnhappy Sonne Why do you looke on vs, and shake your head, And call vs Orphans, Wretches, Castawayes, If that our Noble Father were aliue? My pretty Cosins, you mistake me both, I do lament the sicknesse of the King, As loath to lose him, not your Fathers death: It were lost sorrow to waile one that's lost Then you conclude, (my Grandam) he is dead: The King mine Vnckle is too blame for it. God will reuenge it, whom I will importune With earnest prayers, all to that effect And so will I Peace children peace, the King doth loue you wel. Incapeable, and shallow Innocents, You cannot guesse who caus'd your Fathers death Grandam we can: for my good Vnkle Gloster Told me, the King prouok'd to it by the Queene, Deuis'd impeachments to imprison him; And when my Vnckle told me so, he wept, And pittied me, and kindly kist my cheeke: Bad me rely on him, as on my Father, And he would loue me deerely as a childe Ah! that Deceit should steale such gentle shape, And with a vertuous Vizor hide deepe vice. He is my sonne, I, and therein my shame, Yet from my dugges, he drew not this deceit Thinke you my Vnkle did dissemble Grandam? I Boy I cannot thinke it. Hearke, what noise is this? after her. Ah! who shall hinder me to waile and weepe? To chide my Fortune, and torment my Selfe. Ile ioyne with blacke dispaire against my Soule, And to my selfe, become an enemie What meanes this Scene of rude impatience? To make an act of Tragicke violence. Edward my Lord, thy Sonne, our King is dead. Why grow the Branches, when the Roote is gone? Why wither not the leaues that want their sap? If you will liue, Lament: if dye, be breefe, That our swift-winged Soules may catch the Kings, Or like obedient Subiects follow him, To his new Kingdome of nere-changing night Ah so much interest haue in thy sorrow, As I had Title in thy Noble Husband: I haue bewept a worthy Husbands death, And liu'd with looking on his Images: But now two Mirrors of his Princely semblance, Are crack'd in pieces, by malignant death, And I for comfort, haue but one false Glasse, That greeues me, when I see my shame in him. Thou art a Widdow: yet thou art a Mother, And hast the comfort of thy Children left, But death hath snatch'd my Husband from mine Armes, And pluckt two Crutches from my feeble hands, Clarence, and Edward. O, what cause haue I, (Thine being but a moity of my moane) To ouer-go thy woes, and drowne thy cries Ah Aunt! you wept not for our Fathers death: How can we ayde you with our Kindred teares? Our fatherlesse distresse was left vnmoan'd, Your widdow-dolour, likewise be vnwept Giue me no helpe in Lamentation, I am not barren to bring forth complaints: All Springs reduce their currents to mine eyes, That I being gouern'd by the waterie Moone, May send forth plenteous teares to drowne the World. Ah, for my Husband, for my deere Lord Edward Ah for our Father, for our deere Lord Clarence Alas for both, both mine Edward and Clarence What stay had I but Edward, and hee's gone? What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone What stayes had I, but they? and they are gone Was neuer widdow had so deere a losse Were neuer Orphans had so deere a losse Was neuer Mother had so deere a losse. Alas! I am the Mother of these Greefes, Their woes are parcell'd, mine is generall. She for an Edward weepes, and so do I: I for a Clarence weepes, so doth not shee: These Babes for Clarence weepe, so do not they. Alas! you three, on me threefold distrest: Power all your teares, I am your sorrowes Nurse, And I will pamper it with Lamentation Comfort deere Mother, God is much displeas'd, That you take with vnthankfulnesse his doing. In common worldly things, 'tis call'd vngratefull, With dull vnwillingnesse to repay a debt, Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent: Much more to be thus opposite with heauen, For it requires the Royall debt it lent you Madam, bethinke you like a carefull Mother Of the young Prince your sonne: send straight for him, Let him be Crown'd, in him your comfort liues. Drowne desperate sorrow in dead Edwards graue, And plant your ioyes in liuing Edwards Throne. Sister haue comfort, all of vs haue cause To waile the dimming of our shining Starre: But none can helpe our harmes by wayling them. Madam, my Mother, I do cry you mercie, I did not see your Grace. Humbly on my knee, I craue your Blessing God blesse thee, and put meeknes in thy breast, Loue Charity, Obedience, and true Dutie Amen, and make me die a good old man, That is the butt-end of a Mothers blessing; I maruell that her Grace did leaue it out You clowdy-Princes, & hart-sorowing-Peeres, That beare this heauie mutuall loade of Moane, Now cheere each other, in each others Loue: Though we haue spent our Haruest of this King, We are to reape the Haruest of his Sonne. The broken rancour of your high-swolne hates, But lately splinter'd, knit, and ioyn'd together, Must gently be preseru'd, cherisht, and kept: Me seemeth good, that with some little Traine, Forthwith from Ludlow, the young Prince be set Hither to London, to be crown'd our King Why with some little Traine, My Lord of Buckingham? Marrie my Lord, least by a multitude, The new-heal'd wound of Malice should breake out, Which would be so much the more dangerous, By how much the estate is greene, and yet vngouern'd. Where euery Horse beares his commanding Reine, And may direct his course as please himselfe, As well the feare of harme, as harme apparant, In my opinion, ought to be preuented I hope the King made peace with all of vs, And the compact is firme, and true in me And so in me, and so (I thinke) in all. Yet since it is but greene, it should be put To no apparant likely-hood of breach, Which haply by much company might be vrg'd: Therefore I say with Noble Buckingham, That it is meete so few should fetch the Prince And so say I Then be it so, and go we to determine Who they shall be that strait shall poste to London. Madam, and you my Sister, will you go To giue your censures in this businesse. Manet Buckingham, and Richard. My Lord, who euer iournies to the Prince, For God sake let not vs two stay at home: For by the way, Ile sort occasion, As Index to the story we late talk'd of, To part the Queenes proud Kindred from the Prince My other selfe, my Counsailes Consistory, My Oracle, My Prophet, my deere Cosin, I, as a childe, will go by thy direction, Toward London then, for wee'l not stay behinde. Scena Tertia. 1.Cit. Good morrow Neighbour, whether away so fast? 2.Cit. I promise you, I scarsely know my selfe: Heare you the newes abroad? 1. Yes, that the King is dead 2. Ill newes byrlady, seldome comes the better: I feare, I feare, 'twill proue a giddy world. 3. Neighbours, God speed 1. Giue you good morrow sir 3. Doth the newes hold of good king Edwards death? 2. I sir, it is too true, God helpe the while 3. Then Masters looke to see a troublous world 1. No, no, by Gods good grace, his Son shall reigne 3. Woe to that Land that's gouern'd by a Childe 2. In him there is a hope of Gouernment, Which in his nonage, counsell vnder him, And in his full and ripened yeares, himselfe No doubt shall then, and till then gouerne well 1. So stood the State, when Henry the sixt Was crown'd in Paris, but at nine months old 3. Stood the State so? No, no, good friends, God wot For then this Land was famously enrich'd With politike graue Counsell; then the King Had vertuous Vnkles to protect his Grace 1. Why so hath this, both by his Father and Mother 3. Better it were they all came by his Father: Or by his Father there were none at all: For emulation, who shall now be neerest, Will touch vs all too neere, if God preuent not. O full of danger is the Duke of Glouster, And the Queenes Sons, and Brothers, haught and proud: And were they to be rul'd, and not to rule, This sickly Land, might solace as before 1. Come, come, we feare the worst: all will be well 3. When Clouds are seen, wisemen put on their clokes; When great leaues fall, then Winter is at hand; When the Sun sets, who doth not looke for night? Vntimely stormes, makes men expect a Dearth: All may be well; but if God sort it so, 'Tis more then we deserue, or I expect 2. Truly, the hearts of men are full of feare: You cannot reason (almost) with a man, That lookes not heauily, and full of dread 3. Before the dayes of Change, still is it so, By a diuine instinct, mens mindes mistrust Pursuing danger: as by proofe we see The Water swell before a boyst'rous storme: But leaue it all to God. Whither away? 2 Marry we were sent for to the Iustices 3 And so was I: Ile beare you company. Scena Quarta. Last night I heard they lay at Stony Stratford, And at Northampton they do rest to night: To morrow, or next day, they will be heere I long with all my heart to see the Prince: I hope he is much growne since last I saw him But I heare no, they say my sonne of Yorke Ha's almost ouertane him in his growth I Mother, but I would not haue it so Why my good Cosin, it is good to grow Grandam, one night as we did sit at Supper, My Vnkle Riuers talk'd how I did grow More then my Brother. I, quoth my Vnkle Glouster, Small Herbes haue grace, great Weeds do grow apace. And since, me thinkes I would not grow so fast, Because sweet Flowres are slow, and Weeds make hast Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold In him that did obiect the same to thee. He was the wretched'st thing when he was yong, So long a growing, and so leysurely, That if his rule were true, he should be gracious And so no doubt he is, my gracious Madam I hope he is, but yet let Mothers doubt Now by my troth, if I had beene remembred, I could haue giuen my Vnkles Grace, a flout, To touch his growth, neerer then he toucht mine How my yong Yorke, I prythee let me heare it Marry (they say) my Vnkle grew so fast, That he could gnaw a crust at two houres old, 'Twas full two yeares ere I could get a tooth. Grandam, this would haue beene a byting Iest I prythee pretty Yorke, who told thee this? Grandam, his Nursse His Nurse? why she was dead, ere y wast borne If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me A parlous Boy: go too, you are too shrew'd Good Madam, be not angry with the Childe Pitchers haue eares. Heere comes a Messenger: What Newes? Such newes my Lord, as greeues me to report How doth the Prince? Well Madam, and in health What is thy Newes? Lord Riuers, and Lord Grey, Are sent to Pomfret, and with them, Sir Thomas Vaughan, Prisoners Who hath committed them? The mighty Dukes, Glouster and Buckingham For what offence? The summe of all I can, I haue disclos'd: Why, or for what, the Nobles were committed, Is all vnknowne to me, my gracious Lord Aye me! I see the ruine of my House: The Tyger now hath seiz'd the gentle Hinde, Insulting Tiranny beginnes to Iutt Vpon the innocent and awelesse Throne: Welcome Destruction, Blood, and Massacre, I see (as in a Map) the end of all Accursed, and vnquiet wrangling dayes, How many of you haue mine eyes beheld? My Husband lost his life, to get the Crowne, And often vp and downe my sonnes were tost For me to ioy, and weepe, their gaine and losse. And being seated, and Domesticke broyles Cleane ouer-blowne, themselues the Conquerors, Make warre vpon themselues, Brother to Brother; Blood to blood, selfe against selfe: O prepostorous And franticke outrage, end thy damned spleene, Or let me dye, to looke on earth no more Come, come my Boy, we will to Sanctuary. Madam, farwell Stay, I will go with you You haue no cause My gracious Lady go, And thether beare your Treasure and your Goodes, For my part, Ile resigne vnto your Grace The Seale I keepe, and so betide to me, As well I tender you, and all of yours. Go, Ile conduct you to the Sanctuary. The Trumpets sound. Cardinall, with others. Welcome sweete Prince to London, To your Chamber Welcome deere Cosin, my thoughts Soueraign The wearie way hath made you Melancholly No Vnkle, but our crosses on the way, Haue made it tedious, wearisome, and heauie. I want more Vnkles heere to welcome me Sweet Prince, the vntainted vertue of your yeers Hath not yet diu'd into the Worlds deceit: No more can you distinguish of a man, Then of his outward shew, which God he knowes, Seldome or neuer iumpeth with the heart. Those Vnkles which you want, were dangerous: Your Grace attended to their Sugred words, But look'd not on the poyson of their hearts: God keepe you from them, and from such false Friends God keepe me from false Friends, But they were none My Lord, the Maior of London comes to greet you. Maior. God blesse your Grace, with health and happie dayes I thanke you, good my Lord, and thank you all: I thought my Mother, and my Brother Yorke, Would long, ere this, haue met vs on the way. Fie, what a Slug is Hastings, that he comes not To tell vs, whether they will come, or no. And in good time, heere comes the sweating Lord Welcome, my Lord: what, will our Mother come? On what occasion God he knowes, not I; The Queene your Mother, and your Brother Yorke, Haue taken Sanctuarie: The tender Prince Would faine haue come with me, to meet your Grace, But by his Mother was perforce with-held Fie, what an indirect and peeuish course Is this of hers? Lord Cardinall, will your Grace Perswade the Queene, to send the Duke of Yorke Vnto his Princely Brother presently? If she denie, Lord Hastings goe with him, And from her iealous Armes pluck him perforce My Lord of Buckingham, if my weake Oratorie Can from his Mother winne the Duke of Yorke, Anon expect him here: but if she be obdurate To milde entreaties, God forbid We should infringe the holy Priuiledge Of blessed Sanctuarie: not for all this Land, Would I be guiltie of so great a sinne You are too sencelesse obstinate, my Lord, Too ceremonious, and traditionall. Weigh it but with the grossenesse of this Age, You breake not Sanctuarie, in seizing him: The benefit thereof is alwayes granted To those, whose dealings haue deseru'd the place, And those who haue the wit to clayme the place: This Prince hath neyther claym'd it, nor deseru'd it, And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot haue it. Then taking him from thence, that is not there, You breake no Priuiledge, nor Charter there: Oft haue I heard of Sanctuarie men, But Sanctuarie children, ne're till now My Lord, you shall o're-rule my mind for once. Come on, Lord Hastings, will you goe with me? I goe, my Lord. Good Lords, make all the speedie hast you may. Say, Vnckle Glocester, if our Brother come, Where shall we soiourne, till our Coronation? Where it think'st best vnto your Royall selfe. If I may counsaile you, some day or two Your Highnesse shall repose you at the Tower: Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit For your best health, and recreation I doe not like the Tower, of any place: Did Iulius Cæsar build that place, my Lord? He did, my gracious Lord, begin that place, Which since, succeeding Ages haue re-edify'd Is it vpon record? or else reported Successiuely from age to age, he built it? Vpon record, my gracious Lord But say, my Lord, it were not registred, Me thinkes the truth should liue from age to age, As 'twere retayl'd to all posteritie, Euen to the generall ending day So wise, so young, they say doe neuer liue long What say you, Vnckle? I say, without Characters, Fame liues long. Thus, like the formall Vice, Iniquitie, I morallize two meanings in one word That Iulius Cæsar was a famous man, With what his Valour did enrich his Wit, His Wit set downe, to make his Valour liue: Death makes no Conquest of his Conqueror, For now he liues in Fame, though not in Life. Ile tell you what, my Cousin Buckingham What, my gracious Lord? And if I liue vntill I be a man, Ile win our ancient Right in France againe, Or dye a Souldier, as I liu'd a King Short Summers lightly haue a forward Spring. Now in good time, heere comes the Duke of Yorke Richard of Yorke, how fares our Noble Brother? Well, my deare Lord, so must I call you now I, Brother, to our griefe, as it is yours: Too late he dy'd, that might haue kept that Title, Which by his death hath lost much Maiestie How fares our Cousin, Noble Lord of Yorke? I thanke you, gentle Vnckle. O my Lord, You said, that idle Weeds are fast in growth: The Prince, my Brother, hath out-growne me farre He hath, my Lord And therefore is he idle? Oh my faire Cousin, I must not say so Then he is more beholding to you, then I He may command me as my Soueraigne, But you haue power in me, as in a Kinsman I pray you, Vnckle, giue me this Dagger My Dagger, little Cousin? with all my heart A Begger, Brother? Of my kind Vnckle, that I know will giue, And being but a Toy, which is no griefe to giue A greater gift then that, Ile giue my Cousin A greater gift? O, that's the Sword to it I, gentle Cousin, were it light enough O then I see, you will part but with light gifts, In weightier things you'le say a Begger nay It is too weightie for your Grace to weare I weigh it lightly, were it heauier What, would you haue my Weapon, little Lord? I would that I might thanke you, as, as, you call me How? Little My Lord of Yorke will still be crosse in talke: Vnckle, your Grace knowes how to beare with him You meane to beare me, not to beare with me: Vnckle, my Brother mockes both you and me, Because that I am little, like an Ape, He thinkes that you should beare me on your shoulders With what a sharpe prouided wit he reasons: To mittigate the scorne he giues his Vnckle, He prettily and aptly taunts himselfe: So cunning, and so young, is wonderfull My Lord, wilt please you passe along? My selfe, and my good Cousin Buckingham, Will to your Mother, to entreat of her To meet you at the Tower, and welcome you what, will you goe vnto the Tower, my Lord? My Lord Protector will haue it so I shall not sleepe in quiet at the Tower Why, what should you feare? Marry, my Vnckle Clarence angry Ghost: My Grandam told me he was murther'd there I feare no Vnckles dead Nor none that liue, I hope And if they liue, I hope I need not feare. But come my Lord: and with a heauie heart, Thinking on them, goe I vnto the Tower. A Senet. Exeunt Prince, Yorke, Hastings, and Dorset. Manet Richard, Buckingham, and Catesby. Thinke you, my Lord, this little prating Yorke Was not incensed by his subtile Mother, To taunt and scorne you thus opprobriously? No doubt, no doubt: Oh 'tis a perillous Boy, Bold, quicke, ingenious, forward, capable: Hee is all the Mothers, from the top to toe Well, let them rest: Come hither Catesby, Thou art sworne as deepely to effect what we intend, As closely to conceale what we impart: Thou know'st our reasons vrg'd vpon the way. What think'st thou? is it not an easie matter, To make William Lord Hastings of our minde, For the installment of this Noble Duke In the Seat Royall of this famous Ile? He for his fathers sake so loues the Prince, That he will not be wonne to ought against him What think'st thou then of Stanley? Will not hee? Hee will doe all in all as Hastings doth Well then, no more but this: Goe gentle Catesby, and as it were farre off, Sound thou Lord Hastings, How he doth stand affected to our purpose, And summon him to morrow to the Tower, To sit about the Coronation. If thou do'st finde him tractable to vs, Encourage him, and tell him all our reasons: If he be leaden, ycie, cold, vnwilling, Be thou so too, and so breake off the talke, And giue vs notice of his inclination: For we to morrow hold diuided Councels, Wherein thy selfe shalt highly be employ'd Commend me to Lord William: tell him Catesby, His ancient Knot of dangerous Aduersaries To morrow are let blood at Pomfret Castle, And bid my Lord, for ioy of this good newes, Giue Mistresse Shore one gentle Kisse the more Good Catesby, goe effect this businesse soundly My good Lords both, with all the heed I can Shall we heare from you, Catesby, ere we sleepe? You shall, my Lord At Crosby House, there shall you find vs both. Now, my Lord, What shall wee doe, if wee perceiue Lord Hastings will not yeeld to our Complots? Chop off his Head: Something wee will determine: And looke when I am King, clayme thou of me The Earledome of Hereford, and all the moueables Whereof the King, my Brother, was possest Ile clayme that promise at your Graces hand And looke to haue it yeelded with all kindnesse. Come, let vs suppe betimes, that afterwards Wee may digest our complots in some forme. Scena Secunda. My Lord, my Lord Who knockes? One from the Lord Stanley What is't a Clocke? Vpon the stroke of foure. Cannot my Lord Stanley sleepe these tedious Nights? So it appeares, by that I haue to say: First, he commends him to your Noble selfe What then? Then certifies your Lordship, that this Night He dreamt, the Bore had rased off his Helme: Besides, he sayes there are two Councels kept; And that may be determin'd at the one, Which may make you and him to rue at th' other. Therefore he sends to know your Lordships pleasure, If you will presently take Horse with him, And with all speed post with him toward the North, To shun the danger that his Soule diuines Goe fellow, goe, returne vnto thy Lord, Bid him not feare the seperated Councell: His Honor and my selfe are at the one, And at the other, is my good friend Catesby; Where nothing can proceede, that toucheth vs, Whereof I shall not haue intelligence: Tell him his Feares are shallow, without instance. And for his Dreames, I wonder hee's so simple, To trust the mock'ry of vnquiet slumbers. To flye the Bore, before the Bore pursues, Were to incense the Bore to follow vs, And make pursuit, where he did meane no chase. Goe, bid thy Master rise, and come to me, And we will both together to the Tower, Where he shall see the Bore will vse vs kindly Ile goe, my Lord, and tell him what you say. Many good morrowes to my Noble Lord Good morrow Catesby, you are early stirring: What newes, what newes, in this our tott'ring State? It is a reeling World indeed, my Lord: And I beleeue will neuer stand vpright, Till Richard weare the Garland of the Realme How weare the Garland? Doest thou meane the Crowne? I, my good Lord Ile haue this Crown of mine cut fro my shoulders, Before Ile see the Crowne so foule mis-plac'd: But canst thou guesse, that he doth ayme at it? I, on my life, and hopes to find you forward, Vpon his partie, for the gaine thereof: And thereupon he sends you this good newes, That this same very day your enemies, The Kindred of the Queene, must dye at Pomfret Indeed I am no mourner for that newes, Because they haue beene still my aduersaries: But, that Ile giue my voice on Richards side, To barre my Masters Heires in true Descent, God knowes I will not doe it, to the death God keepe your Lordship in that gracious minde But I shall laugh at this a twelue-month hence, That they which brought me in my Masters hate, I liue to looke vpon their Tragedie. Well Catesby, ere a fort-night make me older, Ile send some packing, that yet thinke not on't 'Tis a vile thing to dye, my gracious Lord, When men are vnprepar'd, and looke not for it O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out With Riuers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill doe With some men else, that thinke themselues as safe As thou and I, who (as thou know'st) are deare To Princely Richard, and to Buckingham The Princes both make high account of you, For they account his Head vpon the Bridge I know they doe, and I haue well deseru'd it. Come on, come on, where is your Bore-speare man? Feare you the Bore, and goe so vnprouided? My Lord good morrow, good morrow Catesby: You may ieast on, but by the holy Rood, I doe not like these seuerall Councels, I My Lord, I hold my Life as deare as yours, And neuer in my dayes, I doe protest, Was it so precious to me, as 'tis now: Thinke you, but that I know our state secure, I would be so triumphant as I am? The Lords at Pomfret, whe they rode from London, Were iocund, and suppos'd their states were sure, And they indeed had no cause to mistrust: But yet you see, how soone the Day o're-cast. This sudden stab of Rancour I misdoubt: Pray God (I say) I proue a needlesse Coward. What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent Come, come, haue with you: Wot you what, my Lord, To day the Lords you talke of, are beheaded They, for their truth, might better wear their Heads, Then some that haue accus'd them, weare their Hats. But come, my Lord, let's away. Goe on before, Ile talke with this good fellow. How now, Sirrha? how goes the World with thee? The better, that your Lordship please to aske I tell thee man, 'tis better with me now, Then when thou met'st me last, where now we meet: Then was I going Prisoner to the Tower, By the suggestion of the Queenes Allyes. But now I tell thee (keepe it to thy selfe) This day those Enemies are put to death, And I in better state then ere I was God hold it, to your Honors good content Gramercie fellow: there, drinke that for me. Throwes him his Purse. I thanke your Honor. Well met, my Lord, I am glad to see your Honor I thanke thee, good Sir Iohn, with all my heart. I am in your debt, for your last Exercise: Come the next Sabboth, and I will content you Ile wait vpon your Lordship. What, talking with a Priest, Lord Chamberlaine? Your friends at Pomfret, they doe need the Priest, Your Honor hath no shriuing worke in hand Good faith, and when I met this holy man, The men you talke of, came into my minde. What, goe you toward the Tower? I doe, my Lord, but long I cannot stay there: I shall returne before your Lordship, thence Nay like enough, for I stay Dinner there And Supper too, although thou know'st it not. Come, will you goe? Ile wait vpon your Lordship. Scena Tertia. death at Pomfret. Sir Richard Ratcliffe, let me tell thee this, To day shalt thou behold a Subiect die, For Truth, for Dutie, and for Loyaltie God blesse the Prince from all the Pack of you, A Knot you are, of damned Blood-suckers You liue, that shall cry woe for this heereafter Dispatch, the limit of your Liues is out O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody Prison! Fatall and ominous to Noble Peeres: Richard the Second here was hackt to death: And for more slander to thy dismall Seat, Wee giue to thee our guiltlesse blood to drinke Now Margarets Curse is falne vpon our Heads, When shee exclaim'd on Hastings, you, and I, For standing by, when Richard stab'd her Sonne Then curs'd shee Richard, Then curs'd shee Buckingham, Then curs'd shee Hastings. Oh remember God, To heare her prayer for them, as now for vs: And for my Sister, and her Princely Sonnes, Be satisfy'd, deare God, with our true blood, Which, as thou know'st, vniustly must be spilt Make haste, the houre of death is expiate Come Grey, come Vaughan, let vs here embrace. Farewell, vntill we meet againe in Heauen. Scaena Quarta. Ratcliffe, Louell, with others, at a Table. Now Noble Peeres, the cause why we are met, Is to determine of the Coronation: In Gods Name speake, when is the Royall day? Is all things ready for the Royall time? It is, and wants but nomination To morrow then I iudge a happie day Who knowes the Lord Protectors mind herein? Who is most inward with the Noble Duke? Your Grace, we thinke, should soonest know his minde We know each others Faces: for our Hearts, He knowes no more of mine, then I of yours, Or I of his, my Lord, then you of mine: Lord Hastings, you and he are neere in loue I thanke his Grace, I know he loues me well: But for his purpose in the Coronation, I haue not sounded him, nor he deliuer'd His gracious pleasure any way therein: But you, my Honorable Lords, may name the time, And in the Dukes behalfe Ile giue my Voice, Which I presume hee'le take in gentle part. In happie time, here comes the Duke himselfe My Noble Lords, and Cousins all, good morrow: I haue beene long a sleeper: but I trust, My absence doth neglect no great designe, Which by my presence might haue beene concluded Had you not come vpon your Q my Lord, William, Lord Hastings, had pronounc'd your part; I meane your Voice, for Crowning of the King Then my Lord Hastings, no man might be bolder, His Lordship knowes me well, and loues me well. My Lord of Ely, when I was last in Holborne, I saw good Strawberries in your Garden there, I doe beseech you, send for some of them Mary and will, my Lord, with all my heart. Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you. Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our businesse, And findes the testie Gentleman so hot, That he will lose his Head, ere giue consent His Masters Child, as worshipfully he tearmes it, Shall lose the Royaltie of Englands Throne Withdraw your selfe a while, Ile goe with you. We haue not yet set downe this day of Triumph: To morrow, in my iudgement, is too sudden, For I my selfe am not so well prouided, As else I would be, were the day prolong'd. Where is my Lord, the Duke of Gloster? I haue sent for these Strawberries His Grace looks chearfully & smooth this morning, There's some conceit or other likes him well, When that he bids good morrow with such spirit. I thinke there's neuer a man in Christendome Can lesser hide his loue, or hate, then hee, For by his Face straight shall you know his Heart What of his Heart perceiue you in his Face, By any liuelyhood he shew'd to day? Mary, that with no man here he is offended: For were he, he had shewne it in his Lookes. I pray you all, tell me what they deserue, That doe conspire my death with diuellish Plots Of damned Witchcraft, and that haue preuail'd Vpon my Body with their Hellish Charmes The tender loue I beare your Grace, my Lord, Makes me most forward, in this Princely presence, To doome th' Offendors, whosoe're they be: I say, my Lord, they haue deserued death Then be your eyes the witnesse of their euill. Looke how I am bewitch'd: behold, mine Arme Is like a blasted Sapling, wither'd vp: And this is Edwards Wife, that monstrous Witch, Consorted with that Harlot, Strumpet Shore, That by their Witchcraft thus haue marked me If they haue done this deed, my Noble Lord If? thou Protector of this damned Strumpet, Talk'st thou to me of Ifs: thou art a Traytor, Off with his Head; now by Saint Paul I sweare, I will not dine, vntill I see the same. Louell and Ratcliffe, looke that it be done: The rest that loue me, rise, and follow me. Manet Louell and Ratcliffe, with the Lord Hastings. Woe, woe for England, not a whit for me, For I, too fond, might haue preuented this: Stanley did dreame, the Bore did rowse our Helmes, And I did scorne it, and disdaine to flye: Three times to day my Foot-Cloth-Horse did stumble, And started, when he look'd vpon the Tower, As loth to beare me to the slaughter-house. O now I need the Priest, that spake to me: I now repent I told the Pursuiuant, As too triumphing, how mine Enemies To day at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd, And I my selfe secure, in grace and fauour. Oh Margaret, Margaret, now thy heauie Curse Is lighted on poore Hastings wretched Head Come, come, dispatch, the Duke would be at dinner: Make a short Shrift, he longs to see your Head O momentarie grace of mortall men, Which we more hunt for, then the grace of God! Who builds his hope in ayre of your good Lookes, Liues like a drunken Sayler on a Mast, Readie with euery Nod to tumble downe, Into the fatall Bowels of the Deepe Come, come, dispatch, 'tis bootlesse to exclaime O bloody Richard: miserable England, I prophecie the fearefull'st time to thee, That euer wretched Age hath look'd vpon. Come, lead me to the Block, beare him my Head, They smile at me, who shortly shall be dead. ill-fauoured. Come Cousin, Canst thou quake, and change thy colour, Murther thy breath in middle of a word, And then againe begin, and stop againe, As if thou were distraught, and mad with terror? Tut, I can counterfeit the deepe Tragedian, Speake, and looke backe, and prie on euery side, Tremble and start at wagging of a Straw: Intending deepe suspition, gastly Lookes Are at my seruice, like enforced Smiles; And both are readie in their Offices, At any time to grace my Stratagemes. But what, is Catesby gone? He is, and see he brings the Maior along. Lord Maior Looke to the Draw-Bridge there Hearke, a Drumme Catesby, o're-looke the Walls Lord Maior, the reason we haue sent Looke back, defend thee, here are Enemies God and our Innocencie defend, and guard vs. Be patient, they are friends: Ratcliffe, and Louell Here is the Head of that ignoble Traytor, The dangerous and vnsuspected Hastings So deare I lou'd the man, that I must weepe: I tooke him for the plainest harmelesse Creature, That breath'd vpon the Earth, a Christian. Made him my Booke, wherein my Soule recorded The Historie of all her secret thoughts. So smooth he dawb'd his Vice with shew of Vertue, That his apparant open Guilt omitted, I meane, his Conuersation with Shores Wife, He liu'd from all attainder of suspects Well, well, he was the couertst sheltred Traytor That euer liu'd. Would you imagine, or almost beleeue, Wert not, that by great preseruation We liue to tell it, that the subtill Traytor This day had plotted, in the Councell-House, To murther me, and my good Lord of Gloster Had he done so? What? thinke you we are Turkes, or Infidels? Or that we would, against the forme of Law, Proceed thus rashly in the Villaines death, But that the extreme perill of the case, The Peace of England, and our Persons safetie, Enforc'd vs to this Execution Now faire befall you, he deseru'd his death, And your good Graces both haue well proceeded, To warne false Traytors from the like Attempts I neuer look'd for better at his hands, After he once fell in with Mistresse Shore: Yet had we not determin'd he should dye, Vntill your Lordship came to see his end, Which now the louing haste of these our friends, Something against our meanings, haue preuented; Because, my Lord, I would haue had you heard The Traytor speake, and timorously confesse The manner and the purpose of his Treasons: That you might well haue signify'd the same Vnto the Citizens, who haply may Misconster vs in him, and wayle his death But, my good Lord, your Graces words shal serue, As well as I had seene, and heard him speake: And doe not doubt, right Noble Princes both, But Ile acquaint our dutious Citizens With all your iust proceedings in this case And to that end we wish'd your Lordship here, T' auoid the Censures of the carping World Which since you come too late of our intent, Yet witnesse what you heare we did intend: And so, my good Lord Maior, we bid farwell. Goe after, after, Cousin Buckingham. The Maior towards Guild-Hall hyes him in all poste: There, at your meetest vantage of the time, Inferre the Bastardie of Edwards Children: Tell them, how Edward put to death a Citizen, Onely for saying, he would make his Sonne Heire to the Crowne, meaning indeed his House, Which, by the Signe thereof, was tearmed so. Moreouer, vrge his hatefull Luxurie, And beastiall appetite in change of Lust, Which stretcht vnto their Seruants, Daughters, Wiues, Euen where his raging eye, or sauage heart, Without controll, lusted to make a prey. Nay, for a need, thus farre come neere my Person: Tell them, when that my Mother went with Child Of that insatiate Edward; Noble Yorke, My Princely Father, then had Warres in France, And by true computation of the time, Found, that the Issue was not his begot: Which well appeared in his Lineaments, Being nothing like the Noble Duke, my Father: Yet touch this sparingly, as 'twere farre off, Because, my Lord, you know my Mother liues Doubt not, my Lord, Ile play the Orator, As if the Golden Fee, for which I plead, Were for my selfe: and so, my Lord, adue If you thriue wel, bring them to Baynards Castle, Where you shall finde me well accompanied With reuerend Fathers, and well-learned Bishops I goe, and towards three or foure a Clocke Looke for the Newes that the Guild-Hall affoords. Goe Louell with all speed to Doctor Shaw, Goe thou to Fryer Penker, bid them both Meet me within this houre at Baynards Castle. Now will I goe to take some priuie order, To draw the Brats of Clarence out of sight, And to giue order, that no manner person Haue any time recourse vnto the Princes. Here is the Indictment of the good Lord Hastings, Which in a set Hand fairely is engross'd, That it may be to day read o're in Paules. And marke how well the sequell hangs together: Eleuen houres I haue spent to write it ouer, For yester-night by Catesby was it sent me, The Precedent was full as long a doing, And yet within these fiue houres Hastings liu'd, Vntainted, vnexamin'd, free, at libertie. Here's a good World the while. Who is so grosse, that cannot see this palpable deuice? Yet who so bold, but sayes he sees it not? Bad is the World, and all will come to nought, When such ill dealing must be seene in thought. How now, how now, what say the Citizens? Now by the holy Mother of our Lord, The Citizens are mum, say not a word Toucht you the Bastardie of Edwards Children? I did, with his Contract with Lady Lucy, And his Contract by Deputie in France, Th' vnsatiate greedinesse of his desire, And his enforcement of the Citie Wiues, His Tyrannie for Trifles, his owne Bastardie, As being got, your Father then in France, And his resemblance, being not like the Duke. Withall, I did inferre your Lineaments, Being the right Idea of your Father, Both in your forme, and Noblenesse of Minde: Layd open all your Victories in Scotland, Your Discipline in Warre, Wisdome in Peace, Your Bountie, Vertue, faire Humilitie: Indeed, left nothing fitting for your purpose, Vntoucht, or sleightly handled in discourse. And when my Oratorie drew toward end, I bid them that did loue their Countries good, Cry, God saue Richard, Englands Royall King And did they so? No, so God helpe me, they spake not a word, But like dumbe Statues, or breathing Stones, Star'd each on other, and look'd deadly pale: Which when I saw, I reprehended them, And ask'd the Maior, what meant this wilfull silence? His answer was, the people were not vsed To be spoke to, but by the Recorder. Then he was vrg'd to tell my Tale againe: Thus sayth the Duke, thus hath the Duke inferr'd, But nothing spoke, in warrant from himselfe. When he had done, some followers of mine owne, At lower end of the Hall, hurld vp their Caps, And some tenne voyces cry'd, God saue King Richard: And thus I tooke the vantage of those few. Thankes gentle Citizens, and friends, quoth I, This generall applause, and chearefull showt, Argues your wisdome, and your loue to Richard: And euen here brake off, and came away What tongue-lesse Blockes were they, Would they not speake? Will not the Maior then, and his Brethren, come? The Maior is here at hand: intend some feare, Be not you spoke with, but by mightie suit: And looke you get a Prayer-Booke in your hand, And stand betweene two Church-men, good my Lord, For on that ground Ile make a holy Descant: And be not easily wonne to our requests, Play the Maids part, still answer nay, and take it I goe: and if you plead as well for them, As I can say nay to thee for my selfe, No doubt we bring it to a happie issue Go, go vp to the Leads, the Lord Maior knocks. Welcome, my Lord, I dance attendance here, I thinke the Duke will not be spoke withall. Now Catesby, what sayes your Lord to my request? He doth entreat your Grace, my Noble Lord, To visit him to morrow, or next day: He is within, with two right reuerend Fathers, Diuinely bent to Meditation, And in no Worldly suites would he be mou'd, To draw him from his holy Exercise Returne, good Catesby, to the gracious Duke, Tell him, my selfe, the Maior and Aldermen, In deepe designes, in matter of great moment, No lesse importing then our generall good, Are come to haue some conference with his Grace Ile signifie so much vnto him straight. Ah ha, my Lord, this Prince is not an Edward, He is not lulling on a lewd Loue-Bed, But on his Knees, at Meditation: Not dallying with a Brace of Curtizans, But meditating with two deepe Diuines: Not sleeping, to engrosse his idle Body, But praying, to enrich his watchfull Soule. Happie were England, would this vertuous Prince Take on his Grace the Soueraigntie thereof. But sure I feare we shall not winne him to it Marry God defend his Grace should say vs nay I feare he will: here Catesby comes againe. Now Catesby, what sayes his Grace? He wonders to what end you haue assembled Such troopes of Citizens, to come to him, His Grace not being warn'd thereof before: He feares, my Lord, you meane no good to him Sorry I am, my Noble Cousin should Suspect me, that I meane no good to him: By Heauen, we come to him in perfit loue, And so once more returne, and tell his Grace. When holy and deuout Religious men Are at their Beades, 'tis much to draw them thence, So sweet is zealous Contemplation. See where his Grace stands, tweene two Clergie men Two Props of Vertue, for a Christian Prince, To stay him from the fall of Vanitie: And see a Booke of Prayer in his hand, True Ornaments to know a holy man. Famous Plantagenet, most gracious Prince, Lend fauourable eare to our requests, And pardon vs the interruption Of thy Deuotion, and right Christian Zeale My Lord, there needes no such Apologie: I doe beseech your Grace to pardon me, Who earnest in the seruice of my God, Deferr'd the visitation of my friends. But leauing this, what is your Graces pleasure? Euen that (I hope) which pleaseth God aboue, And all good men, of this vngouern'd Ile I doe suspect I haue done some offence, That seemes disgracious in the Cities eye, And that you come to reprehend my ignorance You haue, my Lord: Would it might please your Grace, On our entreaties, to amend your fault Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian Land Know then, it is your fault, that you resigne The Supreme Seat, the Throne Maiesticall, The Sceptred Office of your Ancestors, Your State of Fortune, and your Deaw of Birth, The Lineall Glory of your Royall House, To the corruption of a blemisht Stock; Whiles in the mildnesse of your sleepie thoughts, Which here we waken to our Countries good, The Noble Ile doth want his proper Limmes: His Face defac'd with skarres of Infamie, His Royall Stock grafft with ignoble Plants, And almost shouldred in the swallowing Gulfe Of darke Forgetfulnesse, and deepe Obliuion. Which to recure, we heartily solicite Your gracious selfe to take on you the charge And Kingly Gouernment of this your Land: Not as Protector, Steward, Substitute, Or lowly Factor, for anothers gaine; But as successiuely, from Blood to Blood, Your Right of Birth, your Empyrie, your owne. For this, consorted with the Citizens, Your very Worshipfull and louing friends, And by their vehement instigation, In this iust Cause come I to moue your Grace I cannot tell, if to depart in silence, Or bitterly to speake in your reproofe, Best fitteth my Degree, or your Condition. If not to answer, you might haply thinke, Tongue-ty'd Ambition, not replying, yeelded To beare the Golden Yoake of Soueraigntie, Which fondly you would here impose on me. If to reproue you for this suit of yours, So season'd with your faithfull loue to me, Then on the other side I check'd my friends. Therefore to speake, and to auoid the first, And then in speaking, not to incurre the last, Definitiuely thus I answer you. Your loue deserues my thankes, but my desert Vnmeritable, shunnes your high request. First, if all Obstacles were cut away, And that my Path were euen to the Crowne, As the ripe Reuenue, and due of Birth: Yet so much is my pouertie of spirit, So mightie, and so manie my defects, That I would rather hide me from my Greatnesse, Being a Barke to brooke no mightie Sea; Then in my Greatnesse couet to be hid, And in the vapour of my Glory smother'd. But God be thank'd, there is no need of me, And much I need to helpe you, were there need: The Royall Tree hath left vs Royall Fruit, Which mellow'd by the stealing howres of time, Will well become the Seat of Maiestie, And make (no doubt) vs happy by his Reigne. On him I lay that, you would lay on me, The Right and Fortune of his happie Starres, Which God defend that I should wring from him My Lord, this argues Conscience in your Grace, But the respects thereof are nice, and triuiall, All circumstances well considered. You say, that Edward is your Brothers Sonne, So say we too, but not by Edwards Wife: For first was he contract to Lady Lucie, Your Mother liues a Witnesse to his Vow; And afterward by substitute betroth'd To Bona, Sister to the King of France. These both put off, a poore Petitioner, A Care-cras'd Mother to a many Sonnes, A Beautie-waining, and distressed Widow, Euen in the after-noone of her best dayes, Made prize and purchase of his wanton Eye, Seduc'd the pitch, and height of his degree, To base declension, and loath'd Bigamie. By her, in his vnlawfull Bed, he got This Edward, whom our Manners call the Prince. More bitterly could I expostulate, Saue that for reuerence to some aliue, I giue a sparing limit to my Tongue. Then good, my Lord, take to your Royall selfe This proffer'd benefit of Dignitie: If not to blesse vs and the Land withall, Yet to draw forth your Noble Ancestrie From the corruption of abusing times, Vnto a Lineall true deriued course Do good my Lord, your Citizens entreat you Refuse not, mightie Lord, this proffer'd loue O make them ioyfull, grant their lawfull suit Alas, why would you heape this Care on me? I am vnfit for State, and Maiestie: I doe beseech you take it not amisse, I cannot, nor I will not yeeld to you If you refuse it, as in loue and zeale, Loth to depose the Child, your Brothers Sonne, As well we know your tendernesse of heart, And gentle, kinde, effeminate remorse, Which we haue noted in you to your Kindred, And egally indeede to all Estates: Yet know, where you accept our suit, or no, Your Brothers Sonne shall neuer reigne our King, But we will plant some other in the Throne, To the disgrace and downe-fall of your House: And in this resolution here we leaue you. Come Citizens, we will entreat no more. Call him againe, sweet Prince, accept their suit: If you denie them, all the Land will rue it Will you enforce me to a world of Cares. Call them againe, I am not made of Stones, But penetrable to your kinde entreaties, Albeit against my Conscience and my Soule. Cousin of Buckingham, and sage graue men, Since you will buckle fortune on my back, To beare her burthen, where I will or no. I must haue patience to endure the Load: But if black Scandall, or foule-fac'd Reproach, Attend the sequell of your Imposition, Your meere enforcement shall acquittance me From all the impure blots and staynes thereof; For God doth know, and you may partly see, How farre I am from the desire of this God blesse your Grace, wee see it, and will say it In saying so, you shall but say the truth Then I salute you with this Royall Title, Long liue King Richard, Englands worthie King Amen To morrow may it please you to be Crown'd Euen when you please, for you will haue it so To morrow then we will attend your Grace, And so most ioyfully we take our leaue Come, let vs to our holy Worke againe. Farewell my Cousins, farewell gentle friends. Yorke, and Marquesse Dorset. Yorke. Who meetes vs heere? My Neece Plantagenet, Led in the hand of her kind Aunt of Gloster? Now, for my Life, shee's wandring to the Tower, On pure hearts loue, to greet the tender Prince. Daughter, well met God giue your Graces both, a happie And a ioyfull time of day As much to you, good Sister: whither away? No farther then the Tower, and as I guesse, Vpon the like deuotion as your selues, To gratulate the gentle Princes there Kind Sister thankes, wee'le enter all together: And in good time, here the Lieutenant comes. Master Lieutenant, pray you, by your leaue, How doth the Prince, and my young Sonne of Yorke? Right well, deare Madame: by your patience, I may not suffer you to visit them, The King hath strictly charg'd the contrary The King? who's that? I meane, the Lord Protector The Lord protect him from that Kingly Title. Hath he set bounds betweene their loue, and me? I am their Mother, who shall barre me from them? Yorke. I am their Fathers Mother, I will see them Their Aunt I am in law, in loue their Mother: Then bring me to their sights, Ile beare thy blame, And take thy Office from thee, on my perill No, Madame, no; I may not leaue it so: I am bound by Oath, and therefore pardon me. Let me but meet you Ladies one howre hence, And Ile salute your Grace of Yorke as Mother, And reuerend looker on of two faire Queenes. Come Madame, you must straight to Westminster, There to be crowned Richards Royall Queene Ah, cut my Lace asunder, That my pent heart may haue some scope to beat, Or else I swoone with this dead-killing newes Despightfull tidings, O vnpleasing newes Be of good cheare: Mother, how fares your Grace? O Dorset, speake not to me, get thee gone, Death and Destruction dogges thee at thy heeles, Thy Mothers Name is ominous to Children. If thou wilt out-strip Death, goe crosse the Seas, And liue with Richmond, from the reach of Hell. Goe hye thee, hye thee from this slaughter-house, Lest thou encrease the number of the dead, And make me dye the thrall of Margarets Curse, Nor Mother, Wife, nor Englands counted Queene Full of wise care, is this your counsaile, Madame: Take all the swift aduantage of the howres: You shall haue Letters from me to my Sonne, In your behalfe, to meet you on the way: Be not ta'ne tardie by vnwise delay Yorke. O ill dispersing Winde of Miserie. O my accursed Wombe, the Bed of Death: A Cockatrice hast thou hatcht to the World, Whose vnauoided Eye is murtherous Come, Madame, come, I in all haste was sent And I with all vnwillingnesse will goe. O would to God, that the inclusiue Verge Of Golden Mettall, that must round my Brow, Were red hot Steele, to seare me to the Braines, Anoynted let me be with deadly Venome, And dye ere men can say, God saue the Queene Goe, goe, poore soule, I enuie not thy glory, To feed my humor, wish thy selfe no harme No: why? When he that is my Husband now, Came to me, as I follow'd Henries Corse, When scarce the blood was well washt from his hands, Which issued from my other Angell Husband, And that deare Saint, which then I weeping follow'd: O, when I say I look'd on Richards Face, This was my Wish: Be thou (quoth I) accurst, For making me, so young, so old a Widow: And when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy Bed; And be thy Wife, if any be so mad, More miserable, by the Life of thee, Then thou hast made me, by my deare Lords death. Loe, ere I can repeat this Curse againe, Grossely grew captiue to his honey words, And prou'd the subiect of mine owne Soules Curse, Which hitherto hath held mine eyes from rest: For neuer yet one howre in his Bed Did I enioy the golden deaw of sleepe, But with his timorous Dreames was still awak'd. Besides, he hates me for my Father Warwicke, And will (no doubt) shortly be rid of me Poore heart adieu, I pittie thy complaining No more, then with my soule I mourne for yours Farewell, thou wofull welcommer of glory Adieu, poore soule, that tak'st thy leaue of it Y. Go thou to Richmond, & good fortune guide thee, Go thou to Richard, and good Angels tend thee, Go thou to Sanctuarie, and good thoughts possesse thee, I to my Graue, where peace and rest lye with mee. Eightie odde yeeres of sorrow haue I seene, And each howres ioy wrackt with a weeke of teene Stay, yet looke backe with me vnto the Tower. Pitty, you ancient Stones, those tender Babes, Whom Enuie hath immur'd within your Walls, Rough Cradle for such little prettie ones, Rude ragged Nurse, old sullen Play-fellow, For tender Princes: vse my Babies well; So foolish Sorrowes bids your Stones farewell. Scena Secunda. Sound a Sennet. Enter Richard in pompe, Buckingham, Catesby, Ratcliffe, Stand all apart. Cousin of Buckingham My gracious Soueraigne Giue me thy hand. Thus high, by thy aduice, and thy assistance, Is King Richard seated: But shall we weare these Glories for a day? Or shall they last, and we reioyce in them? Still liue they, and for euer let them last Ah Buckingham, now doe I play the Touch, To trie if thou be currant Gold indeed: Young Edward liues, thinke now what I would speake Say on my louing Lord Why Buckingham, I say I would be King Why so you are, my thrice-renowned Lord Ha? am I King? 'tis so: but Edward liues Buck True, Noble Prince O bitter consequence! That Edward still should liue true Noble Prince. Cousin, thou wast not wont to be so dull. Shall I be plaine? I wish the Bastards dead, And I would haue it suddenly perform'd. What say'st thou now? speake suddenly, be briefe Your Grace may doe your pleasure Tut, tut, thou art all Ice, thy kindnesse freezes: Say, haue I thy consent, that they shall dye? Giue me some litle breath, some pawse, deare Lord, Before I positiuely speake in this: I will resolue you herein presently. The King is angry, see he gnawes his Lippe I will conuerse with Iron-witted Fooles, And vnrespectiue Boyes: none are for me, That looke into me with considerate eyes, High-reaching Buckingham growes circumspect. Boy My Lord Know'st thou not any, whom corrupting Gold Will tempt vnto a close exploit of Death? I know a discontented Gentleman, Whose humble meanes match not his haughtie spirit: Gold were as good as twentie Orators, And will (no doubt) tempt him to any thing What is his Name? His Name, my Lord, is Tirrell I partly know the man: goe call him hither, The deepe reuoluing wittie Buckingham, No more shall be the neighbor to my counsailes. Hath he so long held out with me, vntyr'd, And stops he now for breath? Well, be it so. How now, Lord Stanley, what's the newes? Know my louing Lord, the Marquesse Dorset As I heare, is fled to Richmond, In the parts where he abides Come hither Catesby, rumor it abroad, That Anne my Wife is very grieuous sicke, I will take order for her keeping close. Inquire me out some meane poore Gentleman, Whom I will marry straight to Clarence Daughter: The Boy is foolish, and I feare not him. Looke how thou dream'st: I say againe, giue out, That Anne, my Queene, is sicke, and like to dye. About it, for it stands me much vpon To stop all hopes, whose growth may dammage me. I must be marryed to my Brothers Daughter, Or else my Kingdome stands on brittle Glasse: Murther her Brothers, and then marry her, Vncertaine way of gaine. But I am in So farre in blood, that sinne will pluck on sinne, Teare-falling Pittie dwells not in this Eye. Is thy Name Tyrrel? Iames Tyrrel, and your most obedient subiect Art thou indeed? Proue me, my gracious Lord Dar'st thou resolue to kill a friend of mine? Please you: But I had rather kill two enemies Why then thou hast it: two deepe enemies, Foes to my Rest, and my sweet sleepes disturbers, Are they that I would haue thee deale vpon: Tyrrel, I meane those Bastards in the Tower Let me haue open meanes to come to them, And soone Ile rid you from the feare of them Thou sing'st sweet Musique: Hearke, come hither Tyrrel, Goe by this token: rise, and lend thine Eare, There is no more but so: say it is done, And I will loue thee, and preferre thee for it I will dispatch it straight. My Lord, I haue consider'd in my minde, The late request that you did sound me in Well, let that rest: Dorset is fled to Richmond I heare the newes, my Lord Stanley, hee is your Wiues Sonne: well, looke vnto it My Lord, I clayme the gift, my due by promise, For which your Honor and your Faith is pawn'd, Th' Earledome of Hertford, and the moueables, Which you haue promised I shall possesse Stanley looke to your Wife: if she conuey Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it What sayes your Highnesse to my iust request? I doe remember me, Henry the Sixt Did prophecie, that Richmond should be King, When Richmond was a little peeuish Boy. A King perhaps May it please you to resolue me in my suit Thou troublest me, I am not in the vaine. And is it thus? repayes he my deepe seruice With such contempt? made I him King for this? O let me thinke on Hastings, and be gone To Brecnock, while my fearefull Head is on. The tyrannous and bloodie Act is done, The most arch deed of pittious massacre That euer yet this Land was guilty of: Dighton and Forrest, who I did suborne To do this peece of ruthfull Butchery, Albeit they were flesht Villaines, bloody Dogges, Melted with tendernesse, and milde compassion, Wept like to Children, in their deaths sad Story. O thus (quoth Dighton) lay the gentle Babes: Thus, thus (quoth Forrest) girdling one another Their lips were foure red Roses on a stalke, And in their Summer Beauty kist each other. A Booke of Prayers on their pillow lay, Which one (quoth Forrest) almost chang'd my minde: But oh the Diuell, there the Villaine stopt: When Dighton thus told on, we smothered The most replenished sweet worke of Nature, That from the prime Creation ere she framed. Hence both are gone with Conscience and Remorse, They could not speake, and so I left them both, To beare this tydings to the bloody King. And heere he comes. All health my Soueraigne Lord Kinde Tirrell, am I happy in thy Newes If to haue done the thing you gaue in charge, Beget your happinesse, be happy then, For it is done But did'st thou see them dead I did my Lord And buried gentle Tirrell The Chaplaine of the Tower hath buried them, But where (to say the truth) I do not know Come to me Tirrel soone, and after Supper, When thou shalt tell the processe of their death. Meane time, but thinke how I may do the good, And be inheritor of thy desire. Farewell till then I humbly take my leaue The Sonne of Clarence haue I pent vp close, His daughter meanly haue I matcht in marriage, The Sonnes of Edward sleepe in Abrahams bosome, And Anne my wife hath bid this world good night. Now for I know the Britaine Richmond aymes At yong Elizabeth my brothers daughter, And by that knot lookes proudly on the Crowne, To her go I, a iolly thriuing wooer. My Lord Good or bad newes, that thou com'st in so bluntly? Bad news my Lord, Mourton is fled to Richmond, And Buckingham backt with the hardy Welshmen Is in the field, and still his power encreaseth Ely with Richmond troubles me more neere, Then Buckingham and his rash leuied Strength. Come, I haue learn'd, that fearfull commenting Is leaden seruitor to dull delay. Delay leds impotent and Snaile-pac'd Beggery: Then fierie expedition be my wing, Ioues Mercury, and Herald for a King: Go muster men: My counsaile is my Sheeld, We must be breefe, when Traitors braue the Field. Scena Tertia. So now prosperity begins to mellow, And drop into the rotten mouth of death: Heere in these Confines slily haue I lurkt, To watch the waining of mine enemies. A dire induction, am I witnesse to, And will to France, hoping the consequence Will proue as bitter, blacke, and Tragicall. Withdraw thee wretched Margaret, who comes heere? Ah my poore Princes! ah my tender Babes: My vnblowed Flowres, new appearing sweets: If yet your gentle soules flye in the Ayre, And be not fixt in doome perpetuall, Houer about me with your ayery wings, And heare your mothers Lamentation Houer about her, say that right for right Hath dim'd your Infant morne, to Aged night So many miseries haue craz'd my voyce, That my woe-wearied tongue is still and mute. Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead? Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet, Edward for Edward, payes a dying debt Wilt thou, O God, flye from such gentle Lambs, And throw them in the intrailes of the Wolfe? When didst thou sleepe, when such a deed was done? When holy Harry dyed, and my sweet Sonne Dead life, blind sight, poore mortall liuing ghost, Woes Scene, Worlds shame, Graues due, by life vsurpt, Breefe abstract and record of tedious dayes, Rest thy vnrest on Englands lawfull earth, Vnlawfully made drunke with innocent blood Ah that thou would'st assoone affoord a Graue, As thou canst yeeld a melancholly seate: Then would I hide my bones, not rest them heere, Ah who hath any cause to mourne but wee? If ancient sorrow be most reuerent, Giue mine the benefit of signeurie, And let my greefes frowne on the vpper hand If sorrow can admit Society. I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him: I had a Husband, till a Richard kill'd him: Thou had'st an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him: Thou had'st a Richard, till a Richard kill'd him I had a Richard too, and thou did'st kill him; I had a Rutland too, thou hop'st to kill him Thou had'st a Clarence too, And Richard kill'd him. From forth the kennell of thy wombe hath crept A Hell-hound that doth hunt vs all to death: That Dogge, that had his teeth before his eyes, To worry Lambes, and lap their gentle blood: That foule defacer of Gods handy worke: That reignes in gauled eyes of weeping soules: That excellent grand Tyrant of the earth, Thy wombe let loose to chase vs to our graues. O vpright, iust, and true-disposing God, How do I thanke thee, that this carnall Curre Prayes on the issue of his Mothers body, And makes her Pue-fellow with others mone Oh Harries wife, triumph not in my woes: God witnesse with me, I haue wept for thine Beare with me: I am hungry for reuenge, And now I cloy me with beholding it. Thy Edward he is dead, that kill'd my Edward, The other Edward dead, to quit my Edward: Yong Yorke, he is but boote, because both they Matcht not the high perfection of my losse. Thy Clarence he is dead, that stab'd my Edward, And the beholders of this franticke play, Th' adulterate Hastings, Riuers, Vaughan, Gray, Vntimely smother'd in their dusky Graues. Richard yet liues, Hels blacke Intelligencer, Onely reseru'd their Factor, to buy soules, And send them thither: But at hand, at hand Insues his pittious and vnpittied end. Earth gapes, Hell burnes, Fiends roare, Saints pray, To haue him sodainly conuey'd from hence: Cancell his bond of life, deere God I pray, That I may liue and say, The Dogge is dead O thou did'st prophesie, the time would come, That I should wish for thee to helpe me curse That bottel'd Spider, that foule bunch-back'd Toad I call'd thee then, vaine flourish of my fortune: I call'd thee then, poore Shadow, painted Queen, The presentation of but what I was; The flattering Index of a direfull Pageant; One heau'd a high, to be hurl'd downe below: A Mother onely mockt with two faire Babes; A dreame of what thou wast, a garish Flagge To be the ayme of euery dangerous Shot; A signe of Dignity, a Breath, a Bubble; A Queene in ieast, onely to fill the Scene. Where is thy Husband now? Where be thy Brothers? Where be thy two Sonnes? Wherein dost thou Ioy? Who sues, and kneeles, and sayes, God saue the Queene? Where be the bending Peeres that flattered thee? Where be the thronging Troopes that followed thee? Decline all this, and see what now thou art. For happy Wife, a most distressed Widdow: For ioyfull Mother, one that wailes the name: For one being sued too, one that humbly sues: For Queene, a very Caytiffe, crown'd with care: For she that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me: For she being feared of all, now fearing one: For she commanding all, obey'd of none. Thus hath the course of Iustice whirl'd about, And left thee but a very prey to time, Hauing no more but Thought of what thou wast. To torture thee the more, being what thou art, Thou didst vsurpe my place, and dost thou not Vsurpe the iust proportion of my Sorrow? Now thy proud Necke, beares halfe my burthen'd yoke, From which, euen heere I slip my wearied head, And leaue the burthen of it all, on thee. Farwell Yorkes wife, and Queene of sad mischance, These English woes, shall make me smile in France O thou well skill'd in Curses, stay a-while, And teach me how to curse mine enemies Forbeare to sleepe the night, and fast the day: Compare dead happinesse, with liuing woe: Thinke that thy Babes were sweeter then they were, And he that slew them fowler then he is: Bett'ring thy losse, makes the bad causer worse, Reuoluing this, will teach thee how to Curse My words are dull, O quicken them with thine Thy woes will make them sharpe, And pierce like mine. Why should calamity be full of words? Windy Atturnies to their Clients Woes, Ayery succeeders of intestine ioyes, Poore breathing Orators of miseries, Let them haue scope, though what they will impart, Helpe nothing els, yet do they ease the hart If so then, be not Tongue-ty'd: go with me, And in the breath of bitter words, let's smother My damned Son, that thy two sweet Sonnes smother'd. The Trumpet sounds, be copious in exclaimes. Who intercepts me in my Expedition? O she, that might haue intercepted thee By strangling thee in her accursed wombe, From all the slaughters (Wretch) that thou hast done Hid'st thou that Forhead with a Golden Crowne Where't should be branded, if that right were right? The slaughter of the Prince that ow'd that Crowne, And the dyre death of my poore Sonnes, and Brothers. Tell me thou Villaine-slaue, where are my Children? Thou Toad, thou Toade, Where is thy Brother Clarence? And little Ned Plantagenet his Sonne? Where is the gentle Riuers, Vaughan, Gray? Where is kinde Hastings? A flourish Trumpets, strike Alarum Drummes: Let not the Heauens heare these Tell-tale women Raile on the Lords Annointed. Strike I say. Either be patient, and intreat me fayre, Or with the clamorous report of Warre, Thus will I drowne your exclamations Art thou my Sonne? I, I thanke God, my Father, and your selfe Then patiently heare my impatience Madam, I haue a touch of your condition, That cannot brooke the accent of reproofe O let me speake Do then, but Ile not heare I will be milde, and gentle in my words And breefe (good Mother) for I am in hast Art thou so hasty? I haue staid for thee (God knowes) in torment and in agony And came I not at last to comfort you? No by the holy Rood, thou know'st it well, Thou cam'st on earth, to make the earth my Hell. A greeuous burthen was thy Birth to me, Tetchy and wayward was thy Infancie. Thy School-daies frightfull, desp'rate, wilde, and furious, Thy prime of Manhood, daring, bold, and venturous: Thy Age confirm'd, proud, subtle, slye, and bloody, More milde, but yet more harmfull; Kinde in hatred: What comfortable houre canst thou name, That euer grac'd me with thy company? Faith none, but Humfrey Hower, That call'd your Grace To Breakefast once, forth of my company. If I be so disgracious in your eye, Let me march on, and not offend you Madam. Strike vp the Drumme I prythee heare me speake You speake too bitterly Heare me a word: For I shall neuer speake to thee againe So Either thou wilt dye, by Gods iust ordinance Ere from this warre thou turne a Conqueror: Or I with greefe and extreame Age shall perish, And neuer more behold thy face againe. Therefore take with thee my most greeuous Curse, Which in the day of Battell tyre thee more Then all the compleat Armour that thou wear'st. My Prayers on the aduerse party fight, And there the little soules of Edwards Children, Whisper the Spirits of thine Enemies, And promise them Successe and Victory: Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end: Shame serues thy life, and doth thy death attend. Though far more cause, yet much lesse spirit to curse Abides in me, I say Amen to her Stay Madam, I must talke a word with you I haue no more sonnes of the Royall Blood For thee to slaughter. For my Daughters (Richard) They shall be praying Nunnes, not weeping Queenes: And therefore leuell not to hit their liues You haue a daughter call'd Elizabeth, Vertuous and Faire, Royall and Gracious? And must she dye for this? O let her liue, And Ile corrupt her Manners, staine her Beauty, Slander my Selfe, as false to Edwards bed: Throw ouer her the vaile of Infamy, So she may liue vnscarr'd of bleeding slaughter, I will confesse she was not Edwards daughter Wrong not her Byrth, she is a Royall Princesse To saue her life, Ile say she is not so Her life is safest onely in her byrth And onely in that safety, dyed her Brothers Loe at their Birth, good starres were opposite No, to their liues, ill friends were contrary All vnauoyded is the doome of Destiny True: when auoyded grace makes Destiny. My Babes were destin'd to a fairer death, If grace had blest thee with a fairer life You speake as if that I had slaine my Cosins? Cosins indeed, and by their Vnckle couzend, Of Comfort, Kingdome, Kindred, Freedome, Life, Whose hand soeuer lanch'd their tender hearts, Thy head (all indirectly) gaue direction. No doubt the murd'rous Knife was dull and blunt, Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart, To reuell in the Intrailes of my Lambes. But that still vse of greefe, makes wilde greefe tame, My tongue should to thy eares not name my Boyes, Till that my Nayles were anchor'd in thine eyes: And I in such a desp'rate Bay of death, Like a poore Barke, of sailes and tackling reft, Rush all to peeces on thy Rocky bosome Madam, so thriue I in my enterprize And dangerous successe of bloody warres, As I intend more good to you and yours, Then euer you and yours by me were harm'd What good is couer'd with the face of heauen, To be discouered, that can do me good Th' aduancement of your children, gentle Lady Vp to some Scaffold, there to lose their heads Vnto the dignity and height of Fortune, The high Imperiall Type of this earths glory Flatter my sorrow with report of it: Tell me, what State, what Dignity, what Honor, Canst thou demise to any childe of mine Euen all I haue; I, and my selfe and all, Will I withall indow a childe of thine: So in the Lethe of thy angry soule, Thou drowne the sad remembrance of those wrongs, Which thou supposest I haue done to thee Be breefe, least that the processe of thy kindnesse Last longer telling then thy kindnesse date Then know, That from my Soule, I loue thy Daughter My daughters Mother thinkes it with her soule What do you thinke? That thou dost loue my daughter from thy soule So from thy Soules loue didst thou loue her Brothers, And from my hearts loue, I do thanke thee for it Be not so hasty to confound my meaning: I meane that with my Soule I loue thy daughter, And do intend to make her Queene of England Well then, who dost y meane shallbe her King Euen he that makes her Queene: Who else should bee? What, thou? Euen so: How thinke you of it? How canst thou woo her? That I would learne of you, As one being best acquainted with her humour And wilt thou learne of me? Madam, with all my heart Send to her by the man that slew her Brothers. A paire of bleeding hearts: thereon ingraue Edward and Yorke, then haply will she weepe: Therefore present to her, as sometime Margaret Did to thy Father, steept in Rutlands blood, A hand-kercheefe, which say to her did dreyne The purple sappe from her sweet Brothers body, And bid her wipe her weeping eyes withall. If this inducement moue her not to loue, Send her a Letter of thy Noble deeds: Tell her, thou mad'st away her Vnckle Clarence, Her Vnckle Riuers, I (and for her sake) Mad'st quicke conueyance with her good Aunt Anne You mocke me Madam, this not the way To win your daughter There is no other way, Vnlesse thou could'st put on some other shape, And not be Richard, that hath done all this Say that I did all this for loue of her Nay then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee Hauing bought loue, with such a bloody spoyle Looke what is done, cannot be now amended: Men shall deale vnaduisedly sometimes, Which after-houres giues leysure to repent. If I did take the Kingdome from your Sonnes, To make amends, Ile giue it to your daughter: If I haue kill'd the issue of your wombe, To quicken your encrease, I will beget Mine yssue of your blood, vpon your Daughter: A Grandams name is little lesse in loue, Then is the doting Title of a Mother; They are as Children but one steppe below, Euen of your mettall, of your very blood: Of all one paine, saue for a night of groanes Endur'd of her, for whom you bid like sorrow. Your Children were vexation to your youth, But mine shall be a comfort to your Age, The losse you haue, is but a Sonne being King, And by that losse, your Daughter is made Queene. I cannot make you what amends I would, Therefore accept such kindnesse as I can. Dorset your Sonne, that with a fearfull soule Leads discontented steppes in Forraine soyle, This faire Alliance, quickly shall call home To high Promotions, and great Dignity. The King that calles your beauteous Daughter Wife, Familiarly shall call thy Dorset, Brother: Againe shall you be Mother to a King: And all the Ruines of distressefull Times, Repayr'd with double Riches of Content. What? we haue many goodly dayes to see: The liquid drops of Teares that you haue shed, Shall come againe, transform'd to Orient Pearle, Aduantaging their Loue, with interest Often-times double gaine of happinesse. Go then (my Mother) to thy Daughter go, Make bold her bashfull yeares, with your experience, Prepare her eares to heare a Woers Tale. Put in her tender heart, th' aspiring Flame Of Golden Soueraignty: Acquaint the Princesse With the sweet silent houres of Marriage ioyes: And when this Arme of mine hath chastised The petty Rebell, dull-brain'd Buckingham, Bound with Triumphant Garlands will I come, And leade thy daughter to a Conquerors bed: To whom I will retaile my Conquest wonne, And she shalbe sole Victoresse, Cæsars Cæsar What were I best to say, her Fathers Brother Would be her Lord? Or shall I say her Vnkle? Or he that slew her Brothers, and her Vnkles? Vnder what Title shall I woo for thee, That God, the Law, my Honor, and her Loue, Can make seeme pleasing to her tender yeares? Inferre faire Englands peace by this Alliance Which she shall purchase with stil lasting warre Tell her, the King that may command, intreats That at her hands, which the kings King forbids Say she shall be a High and Mighty Queene To vaile the Title, as her Mother doth Say I will loue her euerlastingly But how long shall that title euer last? Sweetly in force, vnto her faire liues end But how long fairely shall her sweet life last? As long as Heauen and Nature lengthens it As long as Hell and Richard likes of it Say, I her Soueraigne, am her Subiect low But she your Subiect, lothes such Soueraignty Be eloquent in my behalfe to her An honest tale speeds best, being plainly told Then plainly to her, tell my louing tale Plaine and not honest, is too harsh a style Your Reasons are too shallow, and to quicke O no, my Reasons are too deepe and dead, Too deepe and dead (poore Infants) in their graues, Harpe on it still shall I, till heart-strings breake Harpe not on that string Madam, that is past. Now by my George, my Garter, and my Crowne Prophan'd, dishonor'd, and the third vsurpt I sweare By nothing, for this is no Oath: Thy George prophan'd, hath lost his Lordly Honor; Thy Garter blemish'd, pawn'd his Knightly Vertue; Thy Crowne vsurp'd, disgrac'd his Kingly Glory: If something thou would'st sweare to be beleeu'd, Sweare then by something, that thou hast not wrong'd Then by my Selfe Thy Selfe, is selfe-misvs'd Now by the World 'Tis full of thy foule wrongs My Fathers death Thy life hath it dishonor'd Why then, by Heauen Heauens wrong is most of all: If thou didd'st feare to breake an Oath with him, The vnity the King my husband made, Thou had'st not broken, nor my Brothers died. If thou had'st fear'd to breake an oath by him, Th' Imperiall mettall, circling now thy head, Had grac'd the tender temples of my Child, And both the Princes had bene breathing heere, Which now two tender Bed-fellowes for dust, Thy broken Faith hath made the prey for Wormes. What can'st thou sweare by now The time to come That thou hast wronged in the time ore-past: For I my selfe haue many teares to wash Heereafter time, for time past, wrong'd by thee. The Children liue, whose Fathers thou hast slaughter'd, Vngouern'd youth, to waile it with their age: The Parents liue, whose Children thou hast butcher'd, Old barren Plants, to waile it with their Age. Sweare not by time to come, for that thou hast Misvs'd ere vs'd, by times ill-vs'd repast As I entend to prosper, and repent: So thriue I in my dangerous Affayres Of hostile Armes: My selfe, my selfe confound: Heauen, and Fortune barre me happy houres: Day, yeeld me not thy light; nor Night, thy rest. Be opposite all Planets of good lucke To my proceeding, if with deere hearts loue, Immaculate deuotion, holy thoughts, I tender not thy beautious Princely daughter. In her, consists my Happinesse, and thine: Without her, followes to my selfe, and thee; Her selfe, the Land, and many a Christian soule, Death, Desolation, Ruine, and Decay: It cannot be auoyded, but by this: It will not be auoyded, but by this. Therefore deare Mother (I must call you so) Be the Atturney of my loue to her: Pleade what I will be, not what I haue beene; Not my deserts, but what I will deserue: Vrge the Necessity and state of times, And be not peeuish found, in great Designes Shall I be tempted of the Diuel thus? I, if the Diuell tempt you to do good Shall I forget my selfe, to be my selfe I, if your selfes remembrance wrong your selfe Yet thou didst kil my Children But in your daughters wombe I bury them. Where in that Nest of Spicery they will breed Selues of themselues, to your recomforture Shall I go win my daughter to thy will? And be a happy Mother by the deed I go, write to me very shortly, And you shal vnderstand from me her mind. Beare her my true loues kisse, and so farewell. Relenting Foole, and shallow-changing Woman. How now, what newes? Most mightie Soueraigne, on the Westerne Coast Rideth a puissant Nauie: to our Shores Throng many doubtfull hollow-hearted friends, Vnarm'd, and vnresolu'd to beat them backe. 'Tis thought, that Richmond is their Admirall: And there they hull, expecting but the aide Of Buckingham, to welcome them ashore Some light-foot friend post to y Duke of Norfolk: Ratcliffe thy selfe, or Catesby, where is hee? Here, my good Lord Catesby, flye to the Duke I will, my Lord, with all conuenient haste Catesby come hither, poste to Salisbury: When thou com'st thither: Dull vnmindfull Villaine, Why stay'st thou here, and go'st not to the Duke? First, mighty Liege, tell me your Highnesse pleasure, What from your Grace I shall deliuer to him O true, good Catesby, bid him leuie straight The greatest strength and power that he can make, And meet me suddenly at Salisbury I goe. What, may it please you, shall I doe at Salisbury? Why, what would'st thou doe there, before I goe? Your Highnesse told me I should poste before My minde is chang'd: Stanley, what newes with you? None, good my Liege, to please you with y hearing, Nor none so bad, but well may be reported Hoyday, a Riddle, neither good nor bad: What need'st thou runne so many miles about, When thou mayest tell thy Tale the neerest way? Once more, what newes? Richmond is on the Seas There let him sinke, and be the Seas on him, White-liuer'd Runnagate, what doth he there? I know not, mightie Soueraigne, but by guesse Well, as you guesse Stirr'd vp by Dorset, Buckingham, and Morton, He makes for England, here to clayme the Crowne Is the Chayre emptie? is the Sword vnsway'd? Is the King dead? the Empire vnpossest? What Heire of Yorke is there aliue, but wee? And who is Englands King, but great Yorkes Heire? Then tell me, what makes he vpon the Seas? Vnlesse for that, my Liege, I cannot guesse Vnlesse for that he comes to be your Liege, You cannot guesse wherefore the Welchman comes. Thou wilt reuolt, and flye to him, I feare No, my good Lord, therefore mistrust me not Where is thy Power then, to beat him back? Where be thy Tenants, and thy followers? Are they not now vpon the Westerne Shore, Safe-conducting the Rebels from their Shippes? No, my good Lord, my friends are in the North Cold friends to me: what do they in the North, When they should serue their Soueraigne in the West? They haue not been commanded, mighty King: Pleaseth your Maiestie to giue me leaue, Ile muster vp my friends, and meet your Grace, Where, and what time your Maiestie shall please I, thou would'st be gone, to ioyne with Richmond: But Ile not trust thee Most mightie Soueraigne, You haue no cause to hold my friendship doubtfull, I neuer was, nor neuer will be false Goe then, and muster men: but leaue behind Your Sonne George Stanley: looke your heart be firme, Or else his Heads assurance is but fraile So deale with him, as I proue true to you. My gracious Soueraigne, now in Deuonshire, As I by friends am well aduertised, Sir Edward Courtney, and the haughtie Prelate, Bishop of Exeter, his elder Brother, With many moe Confederates, are in Armes. In Kent, my Liege, the Guilfords are in Armes, And euery houre more Competitors Flocke to the Rebels, and their power growes strong. My Lord, the Armie of great Buckingham Out on ye, Owles, nothing but Songs of Death, He striketh him. There, take thou that, till thou bring better newes The newes I haue to tell your Maiestie, Is, that by sudden Floods, and fall of Waters, Buckinghams Armie is dispers'd and scatter'd, And he himselfe wandred away alone, No man knowes whither I cry thee mercie: There is my Purse, to cure that Blow of thine. Hath any well-aduised friend proclaym'd Reward to him that brings the Traytor in? Such Proclamation hath been made, my Lord. Sir Thomas Louell, and Lord Marquesse Dorset, 'Tis said, my Liege, in Yorkeshire are in Armes: But this good comfort bring I to your Highnesse, The Brittaine Nauie is dispers'd by Tempest. Richmond in Dorsetshire sent out a Boat Vnto the shore, to aske those on the Banks, If they were his Assistants, yea, or no? Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingham, Vpon his partie: he mistrusting them, Hoys'd sayle, and made his course againe for Brittaine March on, march on, since we are vp in Armes, If not to fight with forraine Enemies, Yet to beat downe these Rebels here at home. My Liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken, That is the best newes: that the Earle of Richmond Is with a mighty power Landed at Milford, Is colder Newes, but yet they must be told Away towards Salsbury, while we reason here, A Royall battell might be wonne and lost: Some one take order Buckingham be brought To Salsbury, the rest march on with me. Exeunt Scena Quarta. Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me, That in the stye of the most deadly Bore, My Sonne George Stanley is frankt vp in hold: If I reuolt, off goes yong Georges head, The feare of that, holds off my present ayde. So get thee gone: commend me to thy Lord. Withall say, that the Queene hath heartily consented He should espouse Elizabeth hir daughter. But tell me, where is Princely Richmond now? At Penbroke, or at Hertford West in Wales What men of Name resort to him Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned Souldier, Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley, Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir Iames Blunt, And Rice ap Thomas, with a valiant Crew, And many other of great name and worth: And towards London do they bend their power, If by the way they be not fought withall Well hye thee to thy Lord: I kisse his hand, My Letter will resolue him of my minde. Will not King Richard let me speake with him? No my good Lord, therefore be patient Hastings, and Edwards children, Gray & Riuers, Holy King Henry, and thy faire Sonne Edward, Vaughan, and all that haue miscarried By vnder-hand corrupted foule iniustice, If that your moody discontented soules, Do through the clowds behold this present houre, Euen for reuenge mocke my destruction. This is All-soules day (Fellow) is it not? It is Why then Al-soules day, is my bodies doomsday This is the day, which in King Edwards time I wish'd might fall on me, when I was found False to his Children, and his Wiues Allies. This is the day, wherein I wisht to fall By the false Faith of him whom most I trusted. This, this All-soules day to my fearfull Soule, Is the determin'd respit of my wrongs: That high All-seer, which I dallied with, Hath turn'd my fained Prayer on my head, And giuen in earnest, what I begg'd in iest. Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men To turne their owne points in their Masters bosomes. Thus Margarets curse falles heauy on my necke: When he (quoth she) shall split thy heart with sorrow, Remember Margaret was a Prophetesse: Come leade me Officers to the blocke of shame, Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame. Scena Secunda. and colours. Fellowes in Armes, and my most louing Frends Bruis'd vnderneath the yoake of Tyranny, Thus farre into the bowels of the Land, Haue we marcht on without impediment; And heere receiue we from our Father Stanley Lines of faire comfort and encouragement: The wretched, bloody, and vsurping Boare, (That spoyl'd your Summer Fields, and fruitfull Vines) Swilles your warm blood like wash, & makes his trough In your embowel'd bosomes: This foule Swine Is now euen in the Centry of this Isle, Ne're to the Towne of Leicester, as we learne: From Tamworth thither, is but one dayes march. In Gods name cheerely on, couragious Friends, To reape the Haruest of perpetuall peace, By this one bloody tryall of sharpe Warre Euery mans Conscience is a thousand men, To fight against this guilty Homicide I doubt not but his Friends will turne to vs He hath no friends, but what are friends for fear, Which in his deerest neede will flye from him All for our vantage, then in Gods name march, True Hope is swift, and flyes with Swallowes wings, Kings it makes Gods, and meaner creatures Kings. Earle of Here pitch our Tent, euen here in Bosworth field, My Lord of Surrey, why looke you so sad? My heart is ten times lighter then my lookes My Lord of Norfolke Heere most gracious Liege Norfolke, we must haue knockes: Ha, must we not? We must both giue and take my louing Lord Vp with my Tent, heere wil I lye to night, But where to morrow? Well, all's one for that. Who hath descried the number of the Traitors? Six or seuen thousand is their vtmost power Why our Battalia trebbles that account: Besides, the Kings name is a Tower of strength, Which they vpon the aduerse Faction want. Vp with the Tent: Come Noble Gentlemen, Let vs suruey the vantage of the ground. Call for some men of sound direction: Let's lacke no Discipline, make no delay, For Lords, to morrow is a busie day. The weary Sunne, hath made a Golden set, And by the bright Tract of his fiery Carre, Giues token of a goodly day to morrow. Sir William Brandon, you shall beare my Standard: Giue me some Inke and Paper in my Tent: Ile draw the Forme and Modell of our Battaile, Limit each Leader to his seuerall Charge, And part in iust proportion our small Power. My Lord of Oxford, you Sir William Brandon, And your Sir Walter Herbert stay with me: The Earle of Pembroke keepes his Regiment; Good Captaine Blunt, beare my goodnight to him, And by the second houre in the Morning, Desire the Earle to see me in my Tent: Yet one thing more (good Captaine) do for me: Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, do you know? Vnlesse I haue mistane his Colours much, (Which well I am assur'd I haue not done) His Regiment lies halfe a Mile at least South, from the mighty Power of the King If without perill it be possible, Sweet Blunt, make some good meanes to speak with him And giue him from me, this most needfull Note Vpon my life, my Lord, Ile vndertake it, And so God giue you quiet rest to night Good night good Captaine Blunt: Come Gentlemen, Let vs consult vpon to morrowes Businesse; Into my Tent, the Dew is rawe and cold. They withdraw into the Tent. What is't a Clocke? It's Supper time my Lord, it's nine a clocke I will not sup to night, Giue me some Inke and Paper: What, is my Beauer easier then it was? And all my Armour laid into my Tent? It is my Liege: and all things are in readinesse Good Norfolke, hye thee to thy charge, Vse carefull Watch, choose trusty Centinels, I go my Lord Stir with the Larke to morrow, gentle Norfolk I warrant you my Lord. Ratcliffe My Lord Send out a Pursuiuant at Armes To Stanleys Regiment: bid him bring his power Before Sun-rising, least his Sonne George fall Into the blinde Caue of eternall night. Fill me a Bowle of Wine: Giue me a Watch, Saddle white Surrey for the Field to morrow: Look that my Staues be sound, & not too heauy. Ratcliff My Lord Saw'st the melancholly Lord Northumberland? Thomas the Earle of Surrey, and himselfe, Much about Cockshut time, from Troope to Troope Went through the Army, chearing vp the Souldiers So, I am satisfied: Giue me a Bowle of Wine, I haue not that Alacrity of Spirit, Nor cheere of Minde that I was wont to haue. Set it downe. Is Inke and Paper ready? It is my Lord Bid my Guard watch. Leaue me. Ratcliffe, about the mid of night come to my Tent And helpe to arme me. Leaue me I say. Fortune, and Victory sit on thy Helme All comfort that the darke night can affoord, Be to thy Person, Noble Father in Law. Tell me, how fares our Noble Mother? I by Attourney, blesse thee from thy Mother, Who prayes continually for Richmonds good: So much for that. The silent houres steale on, And flakie darkenesse breakes within the East. In breefe, for so the season bids vs be, Prepare thy Battell early in the Morning, And put thy Fortune to th' Arbitrement Of bloody stroakes, and mortall staring Warre: I, as I may, that which I would, I cannot, With best aduantage will deceiue the time, And ayde thee in this doubtfull shocke of Armes. But on thy side I may not be too forward, Least being seene, thy Brother, tender George Be executed in his Fathers sight. Farewell: the leysure, and the fearfull time Cuts off the ceremonious Vowes of Loue, And ample enterchange of sweet Discourse, Which so long sundred Friends should dwell vpon: God giue vs leysure for these rites of Loue. Once more Adieu, be valiant, and speed well Good Lords conduct him to his Regiment: Ile striue with troubled noise, to take a Nap, Lest leaden slumber peize me downe to morrow, When I should mount with wings of Victory: Once more, good night kinde Lords and Gentlemen. O thou, whose Captaine I account my selfe, Looke on my Forces with a gracious eye: Put in their hands thy bruising Irons of wrath, That they may crush downe with a heauy fall, Th' vsurping Helmets of our Aduersaries: Make vs thy ministers of Chasticement, That we may praise thee in thy victory: To thee I do commend my watchfull soule, Ere I let fall the windowes of mine eyes: Sleeping, and waking, oh defend me still. to Ri. Let me sit heauy on thy soule to morrow: Thinke how thou stab'st me in my prime of youth At Teukesbury: Dispaire therefore, and dye. Ghost to Richm. Be chearefull Richmond, For the wronged Soules Of butcher'd Princes, fight in thy behalfe: King Henries issue Richmond comforts thee. When I was mortall, my Annointed body By thee was punched full of holes; Thinke on the Tower, and me: Dispaire, and dye, Harry the sixt, bids thee dispaire, and dye. To Richm. Vertuous and holy be thou Conqueror: Harry that prophesied thou should'st be King, Doth comfort thee in sleepe: Liue, and flourish. Let me sit heauy in thy soule to morrow. I that was wash'd to death with Fulsome Wine: Poore Clarence by thy guile betray'd to death: To morrow in the battell thinke on me, And fall thy edgelesse Sword, dispaire and dye. To Richm. Thou off-spring of the house of Lancaster The wronged heyres of Yorke do pray for thee, Good Angels guard thy battell, Liue and Flourish. Let me sit heauy in thy soule to morrow, Riuers, that dy'de at Pomfret: dispaire, and dye Thinke vpon Grey, and let thy soule dispaire Thinke vpon Vaughan, and with guilty feare Let fall thy Lance, dispaire and dye. All to Richm. Awake, And thinke our wrongs in Richards Bosome, Will conquer him. Awake, and win the day. Bloody and guilty: guiltily awake, And in a bloody Battell end thy dayes. Thinke on Lord Hastings: dispaire, and dye. to Rich. Quiet vntroubled soule, Awake, awake: Arme, fight, and conquer, for faire Englands sake. Dreame on thy Cousins Smothered in the Tower: Let vs be laid within thy bosome Richard, And weigh thee downe to ruine, shame, and death, Thy Nephewes soule bids thee dispaire and dye. Ghosts to Richm. Sleepe Richmond, Sleepe in Peace, and wake in Ioy, Good Angels guard thee from the Boares annoy, Liue, and beget a happy race of Kings, Edwards vnhappy Sonnes, do bid thee flourish. Ghost to Rich. Richard, thy Wife, That wretched Anne thy Wife, That neuer slept a quiet houre with thee, Now filles thy sleepe with perturbations, To morrow in the Battaile, thinke on me, And fall thy edgelesse Sword, dispaire and dye: Ghost to Richm. Thou quiet soule, Sleepe thou a quiet sleepe: Dreame of Successe, and Happy Victory, Thy Aduersaries Wife doth pray for thee. Ghost to Rich. The first was I That help'd thee to the Crowne: That last was I that felt thy Tyranny. O, in the Battaile think on Buckingham, And dye in terror of thy guiltinesse. Dreame on, dreame on, of bloody deeds and death, Fainting dispaire; dispairing yeeld thy breath. Ghost to Richm. I dyed for hope Ere I could lend thee Ayde; But cheere thy heart, and be thou not dismayde: God, and good Angels fight on Richmonds side, And Richard fall in height of all his pride. Richard starts out of his dreame. Giue me another Horse, bind vp my Wounds: Haue mercy Iesu. Soft, I did but dreame. O coward Conscience? how dost thou afflict me? The Lights burne blew. It is not dead midnight. Cold fearefull drops stand on my trembling flesh. What? do I feare my Selfe? There's none else by, Richard loues Richard, that is, I am I. Is there a Murtherer heere? No; Yes, I am: Then flye; What from my Selfe? Great reason: why? Lest I Reuenge. What? my Selfe vpon my Selfe? Alacke, I loue my Selfe. Wherefore? For any good That I my Selfe, haue done vnto my Selfe? O no. Alas, I rather hate my Selfe, For hatefull Deeds committed by my Selfe. I am a Villaine: yet I Lye, I am not. Foole, of thy Selfe speake well: Foole, do not flatter. My Conscience hath a thousand seuerall Tongues, And euery Tongue brings in a seuerall Tale, And euerie Tale condemnes me for a Villaine; Periurie, in the high'st Degree, Murther, sterne murther, in the dyr'st degree, All seuerall sinnes, all vs'd in each degree, Throng all to'th' Barre, crying all, Guilty, Guilty. I shall dispaire, there is no Creature loues me; And if I die, no soule shall pittie me. Nay, wherefore should they? Since that I my Selfe, Finde in my Selfe, no pittie to my Selfe. Me thought, the Soules of all that I had murther'd Came to my Tent, and euery one did threat To morrowes vengeance on the head of Richard. My Lord Who's there? Ratcliffe, my Lord, 'tis I: the early Village Cock Hath twice done salutation to the Morne, Your Friends are vp, and buckle on their Armour O Ratcliffe, I feare, I feare Nay good my Lord, be not affraid of Shadows By the Apostle Paul, shadowes to night Haue stroke more terror to the soule of Richard, Then can the substance of ten thousand Souldiers Armed in proofe, and led by shallow Richmond. 'Tis not yet neere day. Come go with me, Vnder our Tents Ile play the Ease-dropper, To heare if any meane to shrinke from me. Good morrow Richmond Cry mercy Lords, and watchfull Gentlemen, That you haue tane a tardie sluggard heere? How haue you slept my Lord? The sweetest sleepe, And fairest boading Dreames, That euer entred in a drowsie head, Haue I since your departure had my Lords. Me thought their Soules, whose bodies Rich. murther'd, Came to my Tent, and cried on Victory: I promise you my Heart is very iocond, In the remembrance of so faire a dreame, How farre into the Morning is it Lords? Vpon the stroke of foure Why then 'tis time to Arme, and giue direction. His Oration to his Souldiers. More then I haue said, louing Countrymen, The leysure and inforcement of the time Forbids to dwell vpon: yet remember this, God, and our good cause, fight vpon our side, The Prayers of holy Saints and wronged soules, Like high rear'd Bulwarkes, stand before our Faces, (Richard except) those whom we fight against, Had rather haue vs win, then him they follow. For, what is he they follow? Truly Gentlemen, A bloudy Tyrant, and a Homicide: One rais'd in blood, and one in blood establish'd; One that made meanes to come by what he hath, And slaughter'd those that were the meanes to help him: A base foule Stone, made precious by the soyle Of Englands Chaire, where he is falsely set: One that hath euer beene Gods Enemy. Then if you fight against Gods Enemy, God will in iustice ward you as his Soldiers. If you do sweare to put a Tyrant downe, You sleepe in peace, the Tyrant being slaine: If you do fight against your Countries Foes, Your Countries Fat shall pay your paines the hyre. If you do fight in safegard of your wiues, Your wiues shall welcome home the Conquerors. If you do free your Children from the Sword, Your Childrens Children quits it in your Age. Then in the name of God and all these rights, Aduance your Standards, draw your willing Swords. For me, the ransome of my bold attempt, Shall be this cold Corpes on the earth's cold face. But if I thriue, the gaine of my attempt, The least of you shall share his part thereof. Sound Drummes and Trumpets boldly, and cheerefully, God, and Saint George, Richmond, and Victory. What said Northumberland as touching Richmond? That he was neuer trained vp in Armes He said the truth: and what said Surrey then? He smil'd and said, the better for our purpose He was in the right, and so indeed it is. Tell the clocke there. Clocke strikes. Giue me a Kalender: Who saw the Sunne to day? Not I my Lord Then he disdaines to shine: for by the Booke He should haue brau'd the East an houre ago, A blacke day will it be to somebody. Ratcliffe My Lord The Sun will not be seene to day, The sky doth frowne, and lowre vpon our Army. I would these dewy teares were from the ground. Not shine to day? Why, what is that to me More then to Richmond? For the selfe-same Heauen That frownes on me, lookes sadly vpon him. Arme, arme, my Lord: the foe vaunts in the field Come, bustle, bustle. Caparison my horse. Call vp Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power, I will leade forth my Soldiers to the plaine, And thus my Battell shal be ordred. My Foreward shall be drawne in length, Consisting equally of Horse and Foot: Our Archers shall be placed in the mid'st; Iohn Duke of Norfolke, Thomas Earle of Surrey, Shall haue the leading of the Foot and Horse. They thus directed, we will follow In the maine Battell, whose puissance on either side Shall be well-winged with our cheefest Horse: This, and Saint George to boote. What think'st thou Norfolke A good direction warlike Soueraigne, This found I on my Tent this Morning. Iockey of Norfolke, be not so bold, For Dickon thy maister is bought and sold A thing deuised by the Enemy. Go Gentlemen, euery man to his Charge, Let not our babling Dreames affright our soules: For Conscience is a word that Cowards vse, Deuis'd at first to keepe the strong in awe, Our strong armes be our Conscience, Swords our Law. March on, ioyne brauely, let vs too't pell mell, If not to heauen, then hand in hand to Hell. What shall I say more then I haue inferr'd? Remember whom you are to cope withall, A sort of Vagabonds, Rascals, and Run-awayes, A scum of Brittaines, and base Lackey Pezants, Whom their o're-cloyed Country vomits forth To desperate Aduentures, and assur'd Destruction. You sleeping safe, they bring you to vnrest: You hauing Lands, and blest with beauteous wiues, They would restraine the one, distaine the other, And who doth leade them, but a paltry Fellow? Long kept in Britaine at our Mothers cost, A Milke-sop, one that neuer in his life Felt so much cold, as ouer shooes in Snow: Let's whip these straglers o're the Seas againe, Lash hence these ouer-weening Ragges of France, These famish'd Beggers, weary of their liues, Who (but for dreaming on this fond exploit) For want of meanes (poore Rats) had hang'd themselues. If we be conquered, let men conquer vs, And not these bastard Britaines, whom our Fathers Haue in their owne Land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd, And on Record, left them the heires of shame. Shall these enioy our Lands? lye with our Wiues? Rauish our daughters? Drum afarre off Hearke, I heare their Drumme, Right Gentlemen of England, fight boldly yeomen, Draw Archers draw your Arrowes to the head, Spurre your proud Horses hard, and ride in blood, Amaze the welkin with your broken staues. What sayes Lord Stanley, will he bring his power? My Lord, he doth deny to come Off with his sonne Georges head My Lord, the Enemy is past the Marsh: After the battaile, let George Stanley dye A thousand hearts are great within my bosom. Aduance our Standards, set vpon our Foes, Our Ancient word of Courage, faire S. George Inspire vs with the spleene of fiery Dragons: Vpon them, Victorie sits on our helpes. Rescue my Lord of Norfolke, Rescue, Rescue: The King enacts more wonders then a man, Daring an opposite to euery danger: His horse is slaine, and all on foot he fights, Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death: Rescue faire Lord, or else the day is lost. A Horse, a Horse, my Kingdome for a Horse Withdraw my Lord, Ile helpe you to a Horse Slaue, I haue set my life vpon a cast, And I will stand the hazard of the Dye: I thinke there be sixe Richmonds in the field, Fiue haue I slaine to day, in stead of him. A Horse, a Horse, my Kingdome for a Horse. slaine. Retreat, and Flourish. Enter Richmond, Derby bearing the Crowne, with diuers other Lords. God, and your Armes Be prais'd Victorious Friends; The day is ours, the bloudy Dogge is dead Couragious Richmond, Well hast thou acquit thee: Loe, Heere these long vsurped Royalties, From the dead Temples of this bloudy Wretch, Haue I pluck'd off, to grace thy Browes withall. Weare it, and make much of it Great God of Heauen, say Amen to all. But tell me, is yong George Stanley liuing? He is my Lord, and safe in Leicester Towne, Whither (if you please) we may withdraw vs What men of name are slaine on either side? Iohn Duke of Norfolke, Walter Lord Ferris, Sir Robert Brokenbury, and Sir William Brandon Interre their Bodies, as become their Births, Proclaime a pardon to the Soldiers fled, That in submission will returne to vs, And then as we haue tane the Sacrament, We will vnite the White Rose, and the Red. Smile Heauen vpon this faire Coniunction, That long haue frown'd vpon their Enmity: What Traitor heares me, and sayes not Amen? England hath long beene mad, and scarr'd her selfe; The Brother blindely shed the Brothers blood; The Father, rashly slaughtered his owne Sonne; The Sonne compell'd, beene Butcher to the Sire; All this diuided Yorke and Lancaster, Diuided, in their dire Diuision. O now, let Richmond and Elizabeth, The true Succeeders of each Royall House, By Gods faire ordinance, conioyne together: And let thy Heires (God if thy will be so) Enrich the time to come, with Smooth-fac'd Peace, With smiling Plenty, and faire Prosperous dayes. Abate the edge of Traitors, Gracious Lord, That would reduce these bloudy dayes againe, And make poore England weepe in Streames of Blood; Let them not liue to taste this Lands increase, That would with Treason, wound this faire Lands peace. Now Ciuill wounds are stopp'd, Peace liues agen; That she may long liue heere, God say, Amen. with the Chattylion of France. King Iohn. Now say Chatillion, what would France with vs? Thus (after greeting) speakes the King of France, In my behauiour to the Maiesty, The borrowed Maiesty of England heere A strange beginning: borrowed Maiesty? Iohn. Silence (good mother) heare the Embassie Philip of France, in right and true behalfe Of thy deceased brother, Geffreyes sonne, Arthur Plantaginet, laies most lawfull claime To this faire Iland, and the Territories: To Ireland, Poyctiers, Aniowe, Torayne, Maine, Desiring thee to lay aside the sword Which swaies vsurpingly these seuerall titles, And put the same into yong Arthurs hand, Thy Nephew, and right royall Soueraigne Iohn. What followes if we disallow of this? The proud controle of fierce and bloudy warre, To inforce these rights, so forcibly with-held, Io. Heere haue we war for war, & bloud for bloud, Controlement for controlement: so answer France Then take my Kings defiance from my mouth, The farthest limit of my Embassie Iohn. Beare mine to him, and so depart in peace, Be thou as lightning in the eies of France; For ere thou canst report, I will be there: The thunder of my Cannon shall be heard. So hence: be thou the trumpet of our wrath, And sullen presage of your owne decay: An honourable conduct let him haue, Pembroke looke too't: farewell Chattillion. What now my sonne, haue I not euer said How that ambitious Constance would not cease Till she had kindled France and all the world, Vpon the right and party of her sonne. This might haue beene preuented, and made whole With very easie arguments of loue, Which now the mannage of two kingdomes must With fearefull bloudy issue arbitrate Iohn. Our strong possession, and our right for vs Your strong possessio much more then your right, Or else it must go wrong with you and me, So much my conscience whispers in your eare, Which none but heauen, and you, and I, shall heare. My Liege, here is the strangest controuersie Come from the Country to be iudg'd by you That ere I heard: shall I produce the men? Iohn. Let them approach: Our Abbies and our Priories shall pay This expeditions charge: what men are you? Your faithfull subiect, I a gentleman, Borne in Northamptonshire, and eldest sonne As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge, A Souldier by the Honor-giuing-hand Of Cordelion, Knighted in the field Iohn. What art thou? The son and heire to that same Faulconbridge Iohn. Is that the elder, and art thou the heyre? You came not of one mother then it seemes Most certain of one mother, mighty King, That is well knowne, and as I thinke one father: But for the certaine knowledge of that truth, I put you o're to heauen, and to my mother; Of that I doubt, as all mens children may Out on thee rude man, y dost shame thy mother, And wound her honor with this diffidence I Madame? No, I haue no reason for it, That is my brothers plea, and none of mine, The which if he can proue, a pops me out, At least from faire fiue hundred pound a yeere: Heauen guard my mothers honor, and my Land Iohn. A good blunt fellow: why being yonger born Doth he lay claime to thine inheritance? I know not why, except to get the land: But once he slanderd me with bastardy: But where I be as true begot or no, That still I lay vpon my mothers head, But that I am as well begot my Liege (Faire fall the bones that tooke the paines for me) Compare our faces, and be Iudge your selfe If old Sir Robert did beget vs both, And were our father, and this sonne like him: O old sir Robert Father, on my knee I giue heauen thankes I was not like to thee Iohn. Why what a mad-cap hath heauen lent vs here? He hath a tricke of Cordelions face, The accent of his tongue affecteth him: Doe you not read some tokens of my sonne In the large composition of this man? Iohn. Mine eye hath well examined his parts, And findes them perfect Richard: sirra speake, What doth moue you to claime your brothers land Because he hath a half-face like my father? With halfe that face would he haue all my land, A halfe-fac'd groat, fiue hundred pound a yeere? My gracious Liege, when that my father liu'd, Your brother did imploy my father much Well sir, by this you cannot get my land, Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother And once dispatch'd him in an Embassie To Germany, there with the Emperor To treat of high affaires touching that time: Th' aduantage of his absence tooke the King, And in the meane time soiourn'd at my fathers; Where how he did preuaile, I shame to speake: But truth is truth, large lengths of seas and shores Betweene my father, and my mother lay, As I haue heard my father speake himselfe When this same lusty gentleman was got: Vpon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd His lands to me, and tooke it on his death That this my mothers sonne was none of his; And if he were, he came into the world Full fourteene weekes before the course of time: Then good my Liedge let me haue what is mine, My fathers land, as was my fathers will Iohn. Sirra, your brother is Legittimate, Your fathers wife did after wedlocke beare him: And if she did play false, the fault was hers, Which fault lyes on the hazards of all husbands That marry wiues: tell me, how if my brother Who as you say, tooke paines to get this sonne, Had of your father claim'd this sonne for his, Insooth, good friend, your father might haue kept This Calfe, bred from his Cow from all the world: Insooth he might: then if he were my brothers, My brother might not claime him, nor your father Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes, My mothers sonne did get your fathers heyre, Your fathers heyre must haue your fathers land Shal then my fathers Will be of no force, To dispossesse that childe which is not his Of no more force to dispossesse me sir, Then was his will to get me, as I think Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge, And like thy brother to enioy thy land: Or the reputed sonne of Cordelion, Lord of thy presence, and no land beside Madam, and if my brother had my shape And I had his, sir Roberts his like him, And if my legs were two such riding rods, My armes, such eele skins stuft, my face so thin, That in mine eare I durst not sticke a rose, Lest men should say, looke where three farthings goes, And to his shape were heyre to all this land, Would I might neuer stirre from off this place, I would giue it euery foot to haue this face: It would not be sir nobbe in any case I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune, Bequeath thy land to him, and follow me? I am a Souldier, and now bound to France Brother, take you my land, Ile take my chance; Your face hath got fiue hundred pound a yeere, Yet sell your face for fiue pence and 'tis deere: Madam, Ile follow you vnto the death Nay, I would haue you go before me thither Our Country manners giue our betters way Iohn. What is thy name? Philip my Liege, so is my name begun, Philip, good old Sir Roberts wiues eldest sonne Iohn. From henceforth beare his name Whose forme thou bearest: Kneele thou downe Philip, but rise more great, Arise Sir Richard, and Plantagenet Brother by th' mothers side, giue me your hand, My father gaue me honor, yours gaue land: Now blessed be the houre by night or day When I was got, Sir Robert was away The very spirit of Plantaginet: I am thy grandame Richard, call me so Madam by chance, but not by truth, what tho; Something about a little from the right, In at the window, or else ore the hatch: Who dares not stirre by day, must walke by night, And haue is haue, how euer men doe catch: Neere or farre off, well wonne is still well shot, And I am I, how ere I was begot Iohn. Goe, Faulconbridge, now hast thou thy desire, A landlesse Knight, makes thee a landed Squire: Come Madam, and come Richard, we must speed For France, for France, for it is more then need Brother adieu, good fortune come to thee, For thou wast got i'th way of honesty. A foot of Honor better then I was, But many a many foot of Land the worse. Well, now can I make any Ioane a Lady, Good den Sir Richard, Godamercy fellow, And if his name be George, Ile call him Peter; For new made honor doth forget mens names: 'Tis two respectiue, and too sociable For your conuersion, now your traueller, Hee and his tooth-picke at my worships messe, And when my knightly stomacke is suffis'd, Why then I sucke my teeth, and catechize My picked man of Countries: my deare sir, Thus leaning on mine elbow I begin, I shall beseech you; that is question now, And then comes answer like an Absey booke: O sir, sayes answer, at your best command, At your employment, at your seruice sir: No sir, saies question, I sweet sir at yours, And so ere answer knowes what question would, Sauing in Dialogue of Complement, And talking of the Alpes and Appenines, The Perennean and the riuer Poe, It drawes toward supper in conclusion so. But this is worshipfull society, And fits the mounting spirit like my selfe; For he is but a bastard to the time That doth not smoake of obseruation, And so am I whether I smacke or no: And not alone in habit and deuice, Exterior forme, outward accoutrement; But from the inward motion to deliuer Sweet, sweet, sweet poyson for the ages tooth, Which though I will not practice to deceiue, Yet to auoid deceit I meane to learne; For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising: But who comes in such haste in riding robes? What woman post is this? hath she no husband That will take paines to blow a horne before her? O me, 'tis my mother: how now good Lady, What brings you heere to Court so hastily? Where is that slaue thy brother? where is he? That holds in chase mine honour vp and downe My brother Robert, old Sir Roberts sonne: Colbrand the Gyant, that same mighty man, Is it Sir Roberts sonne that you seeke so? Sir Roberts sonne, I thou vnreuerend boy, Sir Roberts sonne? why scorn'st thou at sir Robert? He is Sir Roberts sonne, and so art thou Iames Gournie, wilt thou giue vs leaue a while? Good leaue good Philip Philip, sparrow, Iames, There's toyes abroad, anon Ile tell thee more. Madam, I was not old Sir Roberts sonne, Sir Robert might haue eat his part in me Vpon good Friday, and nere broke his fast: Sir Robert could doe well, marrie to confesse Could get me sir Robert could not doe it; We know his handy-worke, therefore good mother To whom am I beholding for these limmes? Sir Robert neuer holpe to make this legge Hast thou conspired with thy brother too, That for thine owne gaine shouldst defend mine honor? What meanes this scorne, thou most vntoward knaue? Knight, knight good mother, Basilisco-like: What, I am dub'd, I haue it on my shoulder: But mother, I am not Sir Roberts sonne, I haue disclaim'd Sir Robert and my land, Legitimation, name, and all is gone; Then good my mother, let me know my father, Some proper man I hope, who was it mother? Hast thou denied thy selfe a Faulconbridge? As faithfully as I denie the deuill King Richard Cordelion was thy father, By long and vehement suit I was seduc'd To make roome for him in my husbands bed: Heauen lay not my transgression to my charge, That art the issue of my deere offence Which was so strongly vrg'd past my defence Now by this light were I to get againe, Madam I would not wish a better father: Some sinnes doe beare their priuiledge on earth, And so doth yours: your fault, was not your follie, Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose, Subiected tribute to commanding loue, Against whose furie and vnmatched force, The awlesse Lion could not wage the fight, Nor keepe his Princely heart from Richards hand: He that perforce robs Lions of their hearts, May easily winne a womans: aye my mother, With all my heart I thanke thee for my father: Who liues and dares but say, thou didst not well When I was got, Ile send his soule to hell. Come Lady I will shew thee to my kinne, And they shall say, when Richard me begot, If thou hadst sayd him nay, it had beene sinne; Who sayes it was, he lyes, I say twas not. Scaena Secunda. Austria, Constance, Arthur. Before Angiers well met braue Austria, Arthur that great fore-runner of thy bloud, Richard that rob'd the Lion of his heart, And fought the holy Warres in Palestine, By this braue Duke came early to his graue: And for amends to his posteritie, At our importance hether is he come, To spread his colours boy, in thy behalfe, And to rebuke the vsurpation Of thy vnnaturall Vncle, English Iohn, Embrace him, loue him, giue him welcome hether God shall forgiue you Cordelions death The rather, that you giue his off-spring life, Shadowing their right vnder your wings of warre: I giue you welcome with a powerlesse hand, But with a heart full of vnstained loue, Welcome before the gates Angiers Duke A noble boy, who would not doe thee right? Vpon thy cheeke lay I this zelous kisse, As seale to this indenture of my loue: That to my home I will no more returne Till Angiers, and the right thou hast in France, Together with that pale, that white-fac'd shore, Whose foot spurnes backe the Oceans roaring tides, And coopes from other lands her Ilanders, Euen till that England hedg'd in with the maine, That Water-walled Bulwarke, still secure And confident from forreine purposes, Euen till that vtmost corner of the West Salute thee for her King, till then faire boy Will I not thinke of home, but follow Armes O take his mothers thanks, a widdows thanks, Till your strong hand shall helpe to giue him strength, To make a more requitall to your loue The peace of heauen is theirs y lift their swords In such a iust and charitable warre Well, then to worke our Cannon shall be bent Against the browes of this resisting towne, Call for our cheefest men of discipline, To cull the plots of best aduantages: Wee'll lay before this towne our Royal bones, Wade to the market-place in French-mens bloud, But we will make it subiect to this boy Stay for an answer to your Embassie, Lest vnaduis'd you staine your swords with bloud, My Lord Chattilion may from England bring That right in peace which heere we vrge in warre, And then we shall repent each drop of bloud, That hot rash haste so indirectly shedde. A wonder Lady: lo vpon thy wish Our Messenger Chattilion is arriu'd, What England saies, say breefely gentle Lord, We coldly pause for thee, Chatilion speake, Then turne your forces from this paltry siege, And stirre them vp against a mightier taske: England impatient of your iust demands, Hath put himselfe in Armes, the aduerse windes Whose leisure I haue staid, haue giuen him time To land his Legions all as soone as I: His marches are expedient to this towne, His forces strong, his Souldiers confident: With him along is come the Mother Queene, An Ace stirring him to bloud and strife, With her her Neece, the Lady Blanch of Spaine, With them a Bastard of the Kings deceast, And all th' vnsetled humors of the Land, Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries, With Ladies faces, and fierce Dragons spleenes, Haue sold their fortunes at their natiue homes, Bearing their birth-rights proudly on their backs, To make a hazard of new fortunes heere: In briefe, a brauer choyse of dauntlesse spirits Then now the English bottomes haue waft o're, Did neuer flote vpon the swelling tide, To doe offence and scathe in Christendome: The interruption of their churlish drums Cuts off more circumstance, they are at hand, Drum beats. To parlie or to fight, therefore prepare How much vnlook'd for, is this expedition By how much vnexpected, by so much We must awake indeuor for defence, For courage mounteth with occasion, Let them be welcome then, we are prepar'd. others. Iohn. Peace be to France: If France in peace permit Our iust and lineall entrance to our owne; If not, bleede France, and peace ascend to heauen. Whiles we Gods wrathfull agent doe correct Their proud contempt that beats his peace to heauen Peace be to England, if that warre returne From France to England, there to liue in peace: England we loue, and for that Englands sake, With burden of our armor heere we sweat: This toyle of ours should be a worke of thine; But thou from louing England art so farre, That thou hast vnder-wrought his lawfull King, Cut off the sequence of posterity, Out-faced Infant State, and done a rape Vpon the maiden vertue of the Crowne: Looke heere vpon thy brother Geffreyes face, These eyes, these browes, were moulded out of his; This little abstract doth containe that large, Which died in Geffrey: and the hand of time, Shall draw this breefe into as huge a volume: That Geffrey was thy elder brother borne, And this his sonne, England was Geffreys right, And this is Geffreyes in the name of God: How comes it then that thou art call'd a King, When liuing blood doth in these temples beat Which owe the crowne, that thou ore-masterest? Iohn. From whom hast thou this great commission France, To draw my answer from thy Articles? Fro that supernal Iudge that stirs good thoughts In any breast of strong authoritie, To looke into the blots and staines of right, That Iudge hath made me guardian to this boy, Vnder whose warrant I impeach thy wrong, And by whose helpe I meane to chastise it Iohn. Alack thou dost vsurpe authoritie Excuse it is to beat vsurping downe Who is it thou dost call vsurper France? Let me make answer: thy vsurping sonne Out insolent, thy bastard shall be King, That thou maist be a Queen, and checke the world My bed was euer to thy sonne as true As thine was to thy husband, and this boy Liker in feature to his father Geffrey Then thou and Iohn, in manners being as like, As raine to water, or deuill to his damme; My boy a bastard? by my soule I thinke His father neuer was so true begot, It cannot be, and if thou wert his mother Theres a good mother boy, that blots thy father There's a good grandame boy That would blot thee Peace Heare the Cryer What the deuill art thou? One that wil play the deuill sir with you, And a may catch your hide and you alone: You are the Hare of whom the Prouerb goes Whose valour plucks dead Lyons by the beard; Ile smoake your skin-coat and I catch you right, Sirra looke too't, yfaith I will, yfaith O well did he become that Lyons robe, That did disrobe the Lion of that robe It lies as sightly on the backe of him As great Alcides shooes vpon an Asse: But Asse, Ile take that burthen from your backe, Or lay on that shall make your shoulders cracke What cracker is this same that deafes our eares With this abundance of superfluous breath? King Lewis, determine what we shall doe strait Women & fooles, breake off your conference. King Iohn, this is the very summe of all: England and Ireland, Angiers, Toraine, Maine, In right of Arthur doe I claime of thee: Wilt thou resigne them, and lay downe thy Armes? My life as soone: I doe defie thee France, Arthur of Britaine, yeeld thee to my hand, And out of my deere loue Ile giue thee more, Then ere the coward hand of France can win; Submit thee boy Come to thy grandame child Doe childe, goe to yt grandame childe, Giue grandame kingdome, and it grandame will Giue yt a plum, a cherry, and a figge, There's a good grandame Good my mother peace, I would that I were low laid in my graue, I am not worth this coyle that's made for me Mo. His mother shames him so, poore boy hee weepes Now shame vpon you where she does or no, His grandames wrongs, and not his mothers shames Drawes those heauen-mouing pearles fro his poor eies, Which heauen shall take in nature of a fee: I, with these Christall beads heauen shall be brib'd To doe him Iustice, and reuenge on you Thou monstrous slanderer of heauen and earth Thou monstrous Iniurer of heauen and earth, Call not me slanderer, thou and thine vsurpe The Dominations, Royalties, and rights Of this oppressed boy; this is thy eldest sonnes sonne, Infortunate in nothing but in thee: Thy sinnes are visited in this poore childe, The Canon of the Law is laide on him, Being but the second generation Remoued from thy sinne-conceiuing wombe Bedlam haue done I haue but this to say, That he is not onely plagued for her sin, But God hath made her sinne and her, the plague On this remoued issue, plagued for her, And with her plague her sinne: his iniury Her iniurie the Beadle to her sinne, All punish'd in the person of this childe, And all for her, a plague vpon her Thou vnaduised scold, I can produce A Will, that barres the title of thy sonne I who doubts that, a Will: a wicked will, A womans will, a cankred Grandams will Peace Lady, pause, or be more temperate, It ill beseemes this presence to cry ayme To these ill-tuned repetitions: Some Trumpet summon hither to the walles These men of Angiers, let vs heare them speake, Whose title they admit, Arthurs or Iohns. Trumpet sounds. Enter a Citizen vpon the walles. Who is it that hath warn'd vs to the walles? 'Tis France, for England England for it selfe: You men of Angiers, and my louing subiects You louing men of Angiers, Arthurs subiects, Our Trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle For our aduantage, therefore heare vs first: These flagges of France that are aduanced heere Before the eye and prospect of your Towne, Haue hither march'd to your endamagement. The Canons haue their bowels full of wrath, And ready mounted are they to spit forth Their Iron indignation 'gainst your walles: All preparation for a bloody siedge And merciles proceeding, by these French. Comfort your Citties eies, your winking gates: And but for our approch, those sleeping stones, That as a waste doth girdle you about By the compulsion of their Ordinance, By this time from their fixed beds of lime Had bin dishabited, and wide hauocke made For bloody power to rush vppon your peace. But on the sight of vs your lawfull King, Who painefully with much expedient march Haue brought a counter-checke before your gates, To saue vnscratch'd your Citties threatned cheekes: Behold the French amaz'd vouchsafe a parle, And now insteed of bulletts wrapt in fire To make a shaking feuer in your walles, They shoote but calme words, folded vp in smoake, To make a faithlesse errour in your eares, Which trust accordingly kinde Cittizens, And let vs in. Your King, whose labour'd spirits Fore-wearied in this action of swift speede, Craues harbourage within your Citie walles When I haue saide, make answer to vs both. Loe in this right hand, whose protection Is most diuinely vow'd vpon the right Of him it holds, stands yong Plantagenet, Sonne to the elder brother of this man, And King ore him, and all that he enioyes: For this downe-troden equity, we tread In warlike march, these greenes before your Towne, Being no further enemy to you Then the constraint of hospitable zeale, In the releefe of this oppressed childe, Religiously prouokes. Be pleased then To pay that dutie which you truly owe, To him that owes it, namely, this yong Prince, And then our Armes, like to a muzled Beare, Saue in aspect, hath all offence seal'd vp: Our Cannons malice vainly shall be spent Against th' involnerable clouds of heauen, And with a blessed and vn-vext retyre, With vnhack'd swords, and Helmets all vnbruis'd, We will beare home that lustie blood againe, Which heere we came to spout against your Towne, And leaue your children, wiues, and you in peace. But if you fondly passe our proffer'd offer, 'Tis not the rounder of your old-fac'd walles, Can hide you from our messengers of Warre, Though all these English, and their discipline Were harbour'd in their rude circumference: Then tell vs, Shall your Citie call vs Lord, In that behalfe which we haue challeng'd it? Or shall we giue the signall to our rage, And stalke in blood to our possession? In breefe, we are the King of Englands subiects For him, and in his right, we hold this Towne Acknowledge then the King, and let me in That can we not: but he that proues the King To him will we proue loyall, till that time Haue we ramm'd vp our gates against the world Doth not the Crowne of England, prooue the King? And if not that, I bring you Witnesses Twice fifteene thousand hearts of Englands breed Bastards and else To verifie our title with their liues As many and as well-borne bloods as those Some Bastards too Stand in his face to contradict his claime Till you compound whose right is worthiest, We for the worthiest hold the right from both Then God forgiue the sinne of all those soules, That to their euerlasting residence, Before the dew of euening fall, shall fleete In dreadfull triall of our kingdomes King Amen, Amen, mount Cheualiers to Armes Saint George that swindg'd the Dragon, And ere since sit's on's horsebacke at mine Hostesse dore Teach vs some sence. Sirrah, were I at home At your den sirrah, with your Lionnesse, I would set an Oxe-head to your Lyons hide: And make a monster of you Peace, no more O tremble: for you heare the Lyon rore Vp higher to the plaine, where we'l set forth In best appointment all our Regiments Speed then to take aduantage of the field It shall be so, and at the other hill Command the rest to stand, God and our right. Heere after excursions, Enter the Herald of France with Trumpets to the gates. Her. You men of Angiers open wide your gates, And let yong Arthur Duke of Britaine in, Who by the hand of France, this day hath made Much worke for teares in many an English mother, Whose sonnes lye scattered on the bleeding ground: Many a widdowes husband groueling lies, Coldly embracing the discoloured earth, And victorie with little losse doth play Vpon the dancing banners of the French, Who are at hand triumphantly displayed To enter Conquerors, and to proclaime Arthur of Britaine, Englands King, and yours. Har. Reioyce you men of Angiers, ring your bels, King Iohn, your king and Englands, doth approach, Commander of this hot malicious day, Their Armours that march'd hence so siluer bright, Hither returne all gilt with Frenchmens blood: There stucke no plume in any English Crest, That is remoued by a staffe of France. Our colours do returne in those same hands That did display them when we first marcht forth: And like a iolly troope of Huntsmen come Our lustie English, all with purpled hands, Dide in the dying slaughter of their foes, Open your gates, and giue the Victors way Heralds, from off our towres we might behold From first to last, the on-set and retyre: Of both your Armies, whose equality By our best eyes cannot be censured: Blood hath bought blood, and blowes haue answerd blowes: Strength matcht with strength, and power confronted power, Both are alike, and both alike we like: One must proue greatest. While they weigh so euen, We hold our Towne for neither: yet for both. France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away? Say, shall the currant of our right rome on, Whose passage vext with thy impediment, Shall leaue his natiue channell, and ore-swell With course disturb'd euen thy confining shores, Vnlesse thou let his siluer Water, keepe A peacefull progresse to the Ocean England thou hast not sau'd one drop of blood In this hot triall more then we of France, Rather lost more. And by this hand I sweare That swayes the earth this Climate ouer-lookes, Before we will lay downe our iust-borne Armes, Wee'l put thee downe, 'gainst whom these Armes wee beare, Or adde a royall number to the dead: Gracing the scroule that tels of this warres losse, With slaughter coupled to the name of kings Ha Maiesty: how high thy glory towres, When the rich blood of kings is set on fire: Oh now doth death line his dead chaps with steele, The swords of souldiers are his teeth, his phangs, And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men In vndetermin'd differences of kings. Why stand these royall fronts amazed thus: Cry hauocke kings, backe to the stained field You equall Potents, fierie kindled spirits, Then let confusion of one part confirm The others peace: till then, blowes, blood, and death Whose party do the Townesmen yet admit? Speake Citizens for England, whose your king The king of England, when we know the king Know him in vs, that heere hold vp his right In Vs, that are our owne great Deputie, And beare possession of our Person heere, Lord of our presence Angiers, and of you A greater powre then We denies all this, And till it be vndoubted, we do locke Our former scruple in our strong barr'd gates: Kings of our feare, vntill our feares resolu'd Be by some certaine king, purg'd and depos'd By heauen, these scroyles of Angiers flout you kings, And stand securely on their battelments, As in a Theater, whence they gape and point At your industrious Scenes and acts of death. Your Royall presences be rul'd by mee, Do like the Mutines of Ierusalem, Be friends a-while, and both conioyntly bend Your sharpest Deeds of malice on this Towne. By East and West let France and England mount. Their battering Canon charged to the mouthes, Till their soule-fearing clamours haue braul'd downe The flintie ribbes of this contemptuous Citie, I'de play incessantly vpon these Iades, Euen till vnfenced desolation Leaue them as naked as the vulgar ayre: That done, disseuer your vnited strengths, And part your mingled colours once againe, Turne face to face, and bloody point to point: Then in a moment Fortune shall cull forth Out of one side her happy Minion, To whom in fauour she shall giue the day, And kisse him with a glorious victory: How like you this wilde counsell mighty States, Smackes it not something of the policie Now by the sky that hangs aboue our heads, I like it well. France, shall we knit our powres, And lay this Angiers euen with the ground, Then after fight who shall be king of it? And if thou hast the mettle of a king, Being wrong'd as we are by this peeuish Towne: Turne thou the mouth of thy Artillerie, As we will ours, against these sawcie walles, And when that we haue dash'd them to the ground, Why then defie each other, and pell-mell, Make worke vpon our selues, for heauen or hell Let it be so: say, where will you assault? We from the West will send destruction Into this Cities bosome I from the North Our Thunder from the South, Shall raine their drift of bullets on this Towne O prudent discipline! From North to South: Austria and France shoot in each others mouth. Ile stirre them to it: Come, away, away Heare vs great kings, vouchsafe awhile to stay And I shall shew you peace, and faire-fac'd league: Win you this Citie without stroke, or wound, Rescue those breathing liues to dye in beds, That heere come sacrifices for the field. Perseuer not, but heare me mighty kings Speake on with fauour, we are bent to heare That daughter there of Spaine, the Lady Blanch Is neere to England, looke vpon the yeeres Of Lewes the Dolphin, and that louely maid. If lustie loue should go in quest of beautie, Where should he finde it fairer, then in Blanch: If zealous loue should go in search of vertue, Where should he finde it purer then in Blanch? If loue ambitious, sought a match of birth, Whose veines bound richer blood then Lady Blanch? Such as she is, in beautie, vertue, birth, Is the yong Dolphin euery way compleat, If not compleat of, say he is not shee, And she againe wants nothing, to name want, If want it be not, that she is not hee. He is the halfe part of a blessed man, Left to be finished by such as shee, And she a faire diuided excellence, Whose fulnesse of perfection lyes in him. O two such siluer currents when they ioyne Do glorifie the bankes that bound them in: And two such shores, to two such streames made one, Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings, To these two Princes, if you marrie them: This Vnion shall do more then batterie can To our fast closed gates: for at this match, With swifter spleene then powder can enforce The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope, And giue you entrance: but without this match, The sea enraged is not halfe so deafe, Lyons more confident, Mountaines and rockes More free from motion, no not death himselfe In mortall furie halfe so peremptorie, As we to keepe this Citie Heeres a stay, That shakes the rotten carkasse of old death Out of his ragges. Here's a large mouth indeede, That spits forth death, and mountaines, rockes, and seas, Talkes as familiarly of roaring Lyons, As maids of thirteene do of puppi-dogges. What Cannoneere begot this lustie blood, He speakes plaine Cannon fire, and smoake, and bounce, He giues the bastinado with his tongue: Our eares are cudgel'd, not a word of his But buffets better then a fist of France: Zounds, I was neuer so bethumpt with words, Since I first cal'd my brothers father Dad Old Qu. Son, list to this coniunction, make this match Giue with our Neece a dowrie large enough, For by this knot, thou shalt so surely tye Thy now vnsur'd assurance to the Crowne, That yon greene boy shall haue no Sunne to ripe The bloome that promiseth a mightie fruite. I see a yeelding in the lookes of France: Marke how they whisper, vrge them while their soules Are capeable of this ambition, Least zeale now melted by the windie breath Of soft petitions, pittie and remorse, Coole and congeale againe to what it was Why answer not the double Maiesties, This friendly treatie of our threatned Towne Speake England first, that hath bin forward first To speake vnto this Cittie: what say you? If that the Dolphin there thy Princely sonne, Can in this booke of beautie read, I loue: Her Dowrie shall weigh equall with a Queene: For Angiers, and faire Toraine Maine, Poyctiers, And all that we vpon this side the Sea, (Except this Cittie now by vs besiedg'd) Finde liable to our Crowne and Dignitie, Shall gild her bridall bed and make her rich In titles, honors, and promotions, As she in beautie, education, blood, Holdes hand with any Princesse of the world What sai'st thou boy? looke in the Ladies face I do my Lord, and in her eie I find A wonder, or a wondrous miracle, The shadow of my selfe form'd in her eye, Which being but the shadow of your sonne, Becomes a sonne and makes your sonne a shadow: I do protest I neuer lou'd my selfe Till now, infixed I beheld my selfe, Drawne in the flattering table of her eie. Whispers with Blanch. Drawne in the flattering table of her eie, Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow, And quarter'd in her heart, hee doth espie Himselfe loues traytor, this is pittie now; That hang'd, and drawne, and quarter'd there should be In such a loue, so vile a Lout as he My vnckles will in this respect is mine, If he see ought in you that makes him like, That any thing he see's which moues his liking, I can with ease translate it to my will: Or if you will, to speake more properly, I will enforce it easlie to my loue. Further I will not flatter you, my Lord, That all I see in you is worthie loue, Then this, that nothing do I see in you, Though churlish thoughts themselues should bee your Iudge, That I can finde, should merit any hate What saie these yong-ones? What say you my Neece? That she is bound in honor still to do What you in wisedome still vouchsafe to say Speake then Prince Dolphin, can you loue this Ladie? Nay aske me if I can refraine from loue, For I doe loue her most vnfainedly Then I doe giue Volquessen, Toraine, Maine, Poyctiers and Aniow, these fiue Prouinces With her to thee, and this addition more, Full thirty thousand Markes of English coyne: Phillip of France, if thou be pleas'd withall, Command thy sonne and daughter to ioyne hands It likes vs well young Princes: close your hands And your lippes too, for I am well assur'd, That I did so when I was first assur'd Now Cittizens of Angires ope your gates, Let in that amitie which you haue made, For at Saint Maries Chappell presently, The rights of marriage shallbe solemniz'd. Is not the Ladie Constance in this troope? I know she is not for this match made vp, Her presence would haue interrupted much. Where is she and her sonne, tell me, who knowes? She is sad and passionate at your highnes Tent And by my faith, this league that we haue made Will giue her sadnesse very little cure: Brother of England, how may we content This widdow Lady? In her right we came, Which we God knowes, haue turn'd another way, To our owne vantage We will heale vp all, For wee'l create yong Arthur Duke of Britaine And Earle of Richmond, and this rich faire Towne We make him Lord of. Call the Lady Constance, Some speedy Messenger bid her repaire To our solemnity: I trust we shall, (If not fill vp the measure of her will) Yet in some measure satisfie her so, That we shall stop her exclamation, Go we as well as hast will suffer vs, To this vnlook'd for vnprepared pompe. Mad world, mad kings, mad composition: Iohn to stop Arthurs Title in the whole, Hath willingly departed with a part, And France, whose armour Conscience buckled on, Whom zeale and charitie brought to the field, As Gods owne souldier, rounded in the eare, With that same purpose-changer, that slye diuel, That Broker, that still breakes the pate of faith, That dayly breake-vow, he that winnes of all, Of kings, of beggers, old men, yong men, maids, Who hauing no externall thing to loose, But the word Maid, cheats the poore Maide of that. That smooth-fac'd Gentleman, tickling commoditie, Commoditie, the byas of the world, The world, who of it selfe is peysed well, Made to run euen, vpon euen ground; Till this aduantage, this vile drawing byas, This sway of motion, this commoditie, Makes it take head from all indifferency, From all direction, purpose, course, intent. And this same byas, this Commoditie, This Bawd, this Broker, this all-changing-word, Clap'd on the outward eye of fickle France, Hath drawne him from his owne determin'd ayd, From a resolu'd and honourable warre, To a most base and vile-concluded peace. And why rayle I on this Commoditie? But for because he hath not wooed me yet: Not that I haue the power to clutch my hand, When his faire Angels would salute my palme, But for my hand, as vnattempted yet, Like a poore begger, raileth on the rich. Well, whiles I am a begger, I will raile, And say there is no sin but to be rich: And being rich, my vertue then shall be, To say there is no vice, but beggerie: Since Kings breake faith vpon commoditie, Gaine be my Lord, for I will worship thee. Gone to be married? Gone to sweare a peace? False blood to false blood ioyn'd. Gone to be freinds? Shall Lewis haue Blaunch, and Blaunch those Prouinces? It is not so, thou hast mispoke, misheard, Be well aduis'd, tell ore thy tale againe. It cannot be, thou do'st but say 'tis so. I trust I may not trust thee, for thy word Is but the vaine breath of a common man: Beleeue me, I doe not beleeue thee man, I haue a Kings oath to the contrarie. Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me, For I am sicke, and capeable of feares, Opprest with wrongs, and therefore full of feares, A widdow, husbandles, subiect to feares, A woman naturally borne to feares; And though thou now confesse thou didst but iest With my vext spirits, I cannot take a Truce, But they will quake and tremble all this day. What dost thou meane by shaking of thy head? Why dost thou looke so sadly on my sonne? What meanes that hand vpon that breast of thine? Why holdes thine eie that lamentable rhewme, Like a proud riuer peering ore his bounds? Be these sad signes confirmers of thy words? Then speake againe, not all thy former tale, But this one word, whether thy tale be true As true as I beleeue you thinke them false, That giue you cause to proue my saying true Oh if thou teach me to beleeue this sorrow, Teach thou this sorrow, how to make me dye, And let beleefe, and life encounter so, As doth the furie of two desperate men, Which in the very meeting fall, and dye. Lewes marry Blaunch? O boy, then where art thou? France friend with England, what becomes of me? Fellow be gone: I cannot brooke thy sight, This newes hath made thee a most vgly man What other harme haue I good Lady done, But spoke the harme, that is by others done? Which harme within it selfe so heynous is, As it makes harmefull all that speake of it I do beseech you Madam be content If thou that bidst me be content, wert grim Vgly, and slandrous to thy Mothers wombe, Full of vnpleasing blots, and sightlesse staines, Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious, Patch'd with foule Moles, and eye-offending markes, I would not care, I then would be content, For then I should not loue thee: no, nor thou Become thy great birth, nor deserue a Crowne. But thou art faire, and at thy birth (deere boy) Nature and Fortune ioyn'd to make thee great. Of Natures guifts, thou mayst with Lillies boast, And with the halfe-blowne Rose. But Fortune, oh, She is corrupted, chang'd, and wonne from thee, Sh' adulterates hourely with thine Vnckle Iohn, And with her golden hand hath pluckt on France To tread downe faire respect of Soueraigntie, And made his Maiestie the bawd to theirs. France is a Bawd to Fortune, and king Iohn, That strumpet Fortune, that vsurping Iohn: Tell me thou fellow, is not France forsworne? Envenom him with words, or get thee gone, And leaue those woes alone, which I alone Am bound to vnder-beare Pardon me Madam, I may not goe without you to the kings Thou maist, thou shalt, I will not go with thee, I will instruct my sorrowes to bee proud, For greefe is proud, and makes his owner stoope, To me and to the state of my great greefe, Lets kings assemble: for my greefe's so great, That no supporter but the huge firme earth Can hold it vp: here I and sorrowes sit, Heere is my Throne bid kings come bow to it. 'Tis true (faire daughter) and this blessed day, Euer in France shall be kept festiuall: To solemnize this day the glorious sunne Stayes in his course, and playes the Alchymist, Turning with splendor of his precious eye The meager cloddy earth to glittering gold: The yearely course that brings this day about, Shall neuer see it, but a holy day A wicked day, and not a holy day. What hath this day deseru'd? what hath it done, That it in golden letters should be set Among the high tides in the Kalender? Nay, rather turne this day out of the weeke, This day of shame, oppression, periury. Or if it must stand still, let wiues with childe Pray that their burthens may not fall this day, Lest that their hopes prodigiously be crost: But (on this day) let Sea-men feare no wracke, No bargaines breake that are not this day made; This day all things begun, come to ill end, Yea, faith it selfe to hollow falshood change By heauen Lady, you shall haue no cause To curse the faire proceedings of this day: Haue I not pawn'd to you my Maiesty? You haue beguil'd me with a counterfeit Resembling Maiesty, which being touch'd and tride, Proues valuelesse: you are forsworne, forsworne, You came in Armes to spill mine enemies bloud, But now in Armes, you strengthen it with yours. The grapling vigor, and rough frowne of Warre Is cold in amitie, and painted peace, And our oppression hath made vp this league: Arme, arme, you heauens, against these periur'd Kings, A widdow cries, be husband to me (heauens) Let not the howres of this vngodly day Weare out the daies in Peace; but ere Sun-set, Set armed discord 'twixt these periur'd Kings, Heare me, Oh, heare me Lady Constance, peace War, war, no peace, peace is to me a warre: O Lymoges, O Austria, thou dost shame That bloudy spoyle: thou slaue, thou wretch, y coward, Thou little valiant, great in villanie, Thou euer strong vpon the stronger side; Thou Fortunes Champion, that do'st neuer fight But when her humourous Ladiship is by To teach thee safety: thou art periur'd too, And sooth'st vp greatnesse. What a foole art thou, A ramping foole, to brag, and stamp, and sweare, Vpon my partie: thou cold blooded slaue, Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side? Beene sworne my Souldier, bidding me depend Vpon thy starres, thy fortune, and thy strength, And dost thou now fall ouer to my foes? Thou weare a Lyons hide, doff it for shame, And hang a Calues skin on those recreant limbes O that a man should speake those words to me And hang a Calues-skin on those recreant limbs Thou dar'st not say so villaine for thy life And hang a Calues-skin on those recreant limbs We like not this, thou dost forget thy selfe. Heere comes the holy Legat of the Pope Haile you annointed deputies of heauen; To thee King Iohn my holy errand is: I Pandulph, of faire Millane Cardinall, And from Pope Innocent the Legate heere, Doe in his name religiously demand Why thou against the Church, our holy Mother, So wilfully dost spurne; and force perforce Keepe Stephen Langton chosen Archbishop Of Canterbury from that holy Sea: This in our foresaid holy Fathers name Pope Innocent, I doe demand of thee What earthie name to Interrogatories Can tast the free breath of a sacred King? Thou canst not (Cardinall) deuise a name So slight, vnworthy, and ridiculous To charge me to an answere, as the Pope: Tell him this tale, and from the mouth of England, Adde thus much more, that no Italian Priest Shall tythe or toll in our dominions: But as we, vnder heauen, are supreame head, So vnder him that great supremacy Where we doe reigne, we will alone vphold Without th' assistance of a mortall hand: So tell the Pope, all reuerence set apart To him and his vsurp'd authoritie Brother of England, you blaspheme in this Though you, and all the Kings of Christendom Are led so grossely by this medling Priest, Dreading the curse that money may buy out, And by the merit of vilde gold, drosse, dust, Purchase corrupted pardon of a man, Who in that sale sels pardon from himselfe: Though you, and al the rest so grossely led, This iugling witchcraft with reuennue cherish, Yet I alone, alone doe me oppose Against the Pope, and count his friends my foes Then by the lawfull power that I haue, Thou shalt stand curst, and excommunicate, And blessed shall he be that doth reuolt From his Allegeance to an heretique, And meritorious shall that hand be call'd, Canonized and worship'd as a Saint, That takes away by any secret course Thy hatefull life O lawfull let it be That I haue roome with Rome to curse a while, Good Father Cardinall, cry thou Amen To my keene curses; for without my wrong There is no tongue hath power to curse him right There's Law and Warrant (Lady) for my curse And for mine too, when Law can do no right. Let it be lawfull, that Law barre no wrong: Law cannot giue my childe his kingdome heere; For he that holds his Kingdome, holds the Law: Therefore since Law it selfe is perfect wrong, How can the Law forbid my tongue to curse? Philip of France, on perill of a curse, Let goe the hand of that Arch-heretique, And raise the power of France vpon his head, Vnlesse he doe submit himselfe to Rome Look'st thou pale France? do not let go thy hand Looke to that Deuill, lest that France repent, And by disioyning hands hell lose a soule King Philip, listen to the Cardinall And hang a Calues-skin on his recreant limbs Well ruffian, I must pocket vp these wrongs, Because, Your breeches best may carry them Philip, what saist thou to the Cardinall? What should he say, but as the Cardinall? Bethinke you father, for the difference Is purchase of a heauy curse from Rome, Or the light losse of England, for a friend: Forgoe the easier That's the curse of Rome O Lewis, stand fast, the deuill tempts thee heere In likenesse of a new vntrimmed Bride The Lady Constance speakes not from her faith, But from her need Oh, if thou grant my need, Which onely liues but by the death of faith, That need, must needs inferre this principle, That faith would liue againe by death of need: O then tread downe my need, and faith mounts vp, Keepe my need vp, and faith is trodden downe The king is moud, and answers not to this O be remou'd from him, and answere well Doe so king Philip, hang no more in doubt Hang nothing but a Calues skin most sweet lout I am perplext, and know not what to say What canst thou say, but wil perplex thee more? If thou stand excommunicate, and curst? Good reuerend father, make my person yours, And tell me how you would bestow your selfe? This royall hand and mine are newly knit, And the coniunction of our inward soules Married in league, coupled, and link'd together With all religous strength of sacred vowes, The latest breath that gaue the sound of words Was deepe-sworne faith, peace, amity, true loue Betweene our kingdomes and our royall selues, And euen before this truce, but new before, No longer then we well could wash our hands, To clap this royall bargaine vp of peace, Heauen knowes they were besmear'd and ouer-staind With slaughters pencill; where reuenge did paint The fearefull difference of incensed kings: And shall these hands so lately purg'd of bloud? So newly ioyn'd in loue? so strong in both, Vnyoke this seysure, and this kinde regreete? Play fast and loose with faith? so iest with heauen, Make such vnconstant children of our selues As now againe to snatch our palme from palme: Vn-sweare faith sworne, and on the marriage bed Of smiling peace to march a bloody hoast, And make a ryot on the gentle brow Of true sincerity? O holy Sir My reuerend father, let it not be so; Out of your grace, deuise, ordaine, impose Some gentle order, and then we shall be blest To doe your pleasure, and continue friends All forme is formelesse, Order orderlesse, Saue what is opposite to Englands loue. Therefore to Armes, be Champion of our Church, Or let the Church our mother breathe her curse, A mothers curse, on her reuolting sonne: France, thou maist hold a serpent by the tongue, A cased Lion by the mortall paw, A fasting Tyger safer by the tooth, Then keepe in peace that hand which thou dost hold I may dis-ioyne my hand, but not my faith So mak'st thou faith an enemy to faith, And like a ciuill warre setst oath to oath, Thy tongue against thy tongue. O let thy vow First made to heauen, first be to heauen perform'd, That is, to be the Champion of our Church, What since thou sworst, is sworne against thy selfe, And may not be performed by thy selfe, For that which thou hast sworne to doe amisse, Is not amisse when it is truely done: And being not done, where doing tends to ill, The truth is then most done not doing it: The better Act of purposes mistooke, Is to mistake again, though indirect, Yet indirection thereby growes direct, And falshood, falshood cures, as fire cooles fire It is religion that doth make vowes kept, But thou hast sworne against religion: By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st, And mak'st an oath the suretie for thy truth, Against an oath the truth, thou art vnsure To sweare, sweares onely not to be forsworne, Else what a mockerie should it be to sweare? But thou dost sweare, onely to be forsworne, And most forsworne, to keepe what thou dost sweare, Therefore thy later vowes, against thy first, Is in thy selfe rebellion to thy selfe: And better conquest neuer canst thou make, Then arme thy constant and thy nobler parts Against these giddy loose suggestions: Vpon which better part, our prayrs come in, If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know The perill of our curses light on thee So heauy, as thou shalt not shake them off But in despaire, dye vnder their blacke weight Rebellion, flat rebellion Wil't not be? Will not a Calues-skin stop that mouth of thine? Father, to Armes Vpon thy wedding day? Against the blood that thou hast married? What, shall our feast be kept with slaughtered men? Shall braying trumpets, and loud churlish drums Clamors of hell, be measures to our pomp? O husband heare me: aye, alacke, how new Is husband in my mouth? euen for that name Which till this time my tongue did nere pronounce; Vpon my knee I beg, goe not to Armes Against mine Vncle O, vpon my knee made hard with kneeling, I doe pray to thee, thou vertuous Daulphin, Alter not the doome fore-thought by heauen Now shall I see thy loue, what motiue may Be stronger with thee, then the name of wife? That which vpholdeth him, that thee vpholds, His Honor, Oh thine Honor, Lewis thine Honor I muse your Maiesty doth seeme so cold, When such profound respects doe pull you on? I will denounce a curse vpon his head Thou shalt not need. England, I will fall fro thee O faire returne of banish'd Maiestie O foule reuolt of French inconstancy France, y shalt rue this houre within this houre Old Time the clocke setter, y bald sexton Time: Is it as he will? well then, France shall rue The Sun's orecast with bloud: faire day adieu, Which is the side that I must goe withall? I am with both, each Army hath a hand, And in their rage, I hauing hold of both, They whurle a-sunder, and dismember mee. Husband, I cannot pray that thou maist winne: Vncle, I needs must pray that thou maist lose: Father, I may not wish the fortune thine: Grandam, I will not wish thy wishes thriue: Who-euer wins, on that side shall I lose: Assured losse, before the match be plaid Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies There where my fortune liues, there my life dies Cosen, goe draw our puisance together, France, I am burn'd vp with inflaming wrath, A rage, whose heat hath this condition; That nothing can allay, nothing but blood, The blood and deerest valued bloud of France Thy rage shall burne thee vp, & thou shalt turne To ashes, ere our blood shall quench that fire: Looke to thy selfe, thou art in ieopardie No more then he that threats. To Arms let's hie. Scoena Secunda. Allarums, Excursions: Enter Bastard with Austria's head. Now by my life, this day grows wondrous hot, Some ayery Deuill houers in the skie, And pour's downe mischiefe. Austrias head lye there, While Philip breathes Hubert, keepe this boy: Philip make vp, My Mother is assayled in our Tent, And tane I feare My Lord I rescued her, Her Highnesse is in safety, feare you not: But on my Liege, for very little paines Will bring this labor to an happy end. Hubert, So shall it be: your Grace shall stay behinde So strongly guarded: Cosen, looke not sad, Thy Grandame loues thee, and thy Vnkle will As deere be to thee, as thy father was O this will make my mother die with griefe Cosen away for England, haste before, And ere our comming see thou shake the bags Of hoording Abbots, imprisoned angells Set at libertie: the fat ribs of peace Must by the hungry now be fed vpon: Vse our Commission in his vtmost force Bell, Booke, & Candle, shall not driue me back, When gold and siluer becks me to come on. I leaue your highnesse: Grandame, I will pray (If euer I remember to be holy) For your faire safety: so I kisse your hand Farewell gentle Cosen Coz, farewell Come hether little kinsman, harke, a worde Come hether Hubert. O my gentle Hubert, We owe thee much: within this wall of flesh There is a soule counts thee her Creditor, And with aduantage meanes to pay thy loue: And my good friend, thy voluntary oath Liues in this bosome, deerely cherished. Giue me thy hand, I had a thing to say, But I will fit it with some better tune. By heauen Hubert, I am almost asham'd To say what good respect I haue of thee I am much bounden to your Maiesty Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet, But thou shalt haue: and creepe time nere so slow, Yet it shall come, for me to doe thee good. I had a thing to say, but let it goe: The Sunne is in the heauen, and the proud day, Attended with the pleasures of the world, Is all too wanton, and too full of gawdes To giue me audience: If the mid-night bell Did with his yron tongue, and brazen mouth Sound on into the drowzie race of night: If this same were a Church-yard where we stand, And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs: Or if that surly spirit melancholy Had bak'd thy bloud, and made it heauy, thicke, Which else runnes tickling vp and downe the veines, Making that idiot laughter keepe mens eyes, And straine their cheekes to idle merriment, A passion hatefull to my purposes: Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes, Heare me without thine eares, and make reply Without a tongue, vsing conceit alone, Without eyes, eares, and harmefull sound of words: Then, in despight of brooded watchfull day, I would into thy bosome poure my thoughts: But (ah) I will not, yet I loue thee well, And by my troth I thinke thou lou'st me well So well, that what you bid me vndertake, Though that my death were adiunct to my Act, By heauen I would doe it Doe not I know thou wouldst? Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert throw thine eye On yon young boy: Ile tell thee what my friend, He is a very serpent in my way, And wheresoere this foot of mine doth tread, He lies before me: dost thou vnderstand me? Thou art his keeper And Ile keepe him so, That he shall not offend your Maiesty Death My Lord A Graue He shall not liue Enough. I could be merry now, Hubert, I loue thee. Well, Ile not say what I intend for thee: Remember: Madam, Fare you well, Ile send those powers o're to your Maiesty My blessing goe with thee For England Cosen, goe. Hubert shall be your man, attend on you With al true duetie: On toward Callice, hoa. Scaena Tertia. So by a roaring Tempest on the flood, A whole Armado of conuicted saile Is scattered and dis-ioyn'd from fellowship Courage and comfort, all shall yet goe well What can goe well, when we haue runne so ill? Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost? Arthur tane prisoner? diuers deere friends slaine? And bloudy England into England gone, Ore-bearing interruption spight of France? What he hath won, that hath he fortified: So hot a speed, with such aduice dispos'd, Such temperate order in so fierce a cause, Doth want example: who hath read, or heard Of any kindred-action like to this? Well could I beare that England had this praise, So we could finde some patterne of our shame: Looke who comes heere? a graue vnto a soule, Holding th' eternall spirit against her will, In the vilde prison of afflicted breath: I prethee Lady goe away with me Lo; now: now see the issue of your peace Patience good Lady, comfort gentle Constance No, I defie all Counsell, all redresse, But that which ends all counsell, true Redresse: Death, death, O amiable, louely death, Thou odoriferous stench: sound rottennesse, Arise forth from the couch of lasting night, Thou hate and terror to prosperitie, And I will kisse thy detestable bones, And put my eye-balls in thy vaultie browes, And ring these fingers with thy houshold wormes, And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust, And be a Carrion Monster like thy selfe; Come, grin on me, and I will thinke thou smil'st, And busse thee as thy wife: Miseries Loue, O come to me O faire affliction, peace No, no, I will not, hauing breath to cry: O that my tongue were in the thunders mouth, Then with a passion would I shake the world, And rowze from sleepe that fell Anatomy Which cannot heare a Ladies feeble voyce, Which scornes a moderne Inuocation Lady, you vtter madnesse, and not sorrow Thou art holy to belye me so, I am not mad: this haire I teare is mine, My name is Constance, I was Geffreyes wife, Yong Arthur is my sonne, and he is lost: I am not mad, I would to heauen I were, For then 'tis like I should forget my selfe: O, if I could, what griefe should I forget? Preach some Philosophy to make me mad, And thou shalt be Canoniz'd (Cardinall.) For, being not mad, but sensible of greefe, My reasonable part produces reason How I may be deliuer'd of these woes. And teaches mee to kill or hang my selfe: If I were mad, I should forget my sonne, Or madly thinke a babe of clowts were he; I am not mad: too well, too well I feele The different plague of each calamitie Binde vp those tresses: O what loue I note In the faire multitude of those her haires; Where but by chance a siluer drop hath falne, Euen to that drop ten thousand wiery fiends Doe glew themselues in sociable griefe, Like true, inseparable, faithfull loues, Sticking together in calamitie To England, if you will Binde vp your haires Yes that I will: and wherefore will I do it? I tore them from their bonds, and cride aloud, O, that these hands could so redeeme my sonne, As they haue giuen these hayres their libertie: But now I enuie at their libertie, And will againe commit them to their bonds, Because my poore childe is a prisoner. And Father Cardinall, I haue heard you say That we shall see and know our friends in heauen: If that be true, I shall see my boy againe; For since the birth of Caine, the first male-childe To him that did but yesterday suspire, There was not such a gracious creature borne: But now will Canker-sorrow eat my bud, And chase the natiue beauty from his cheeke, And he will looke as hollow as a Ghost, As dim and meager as an Agues fitte, And so hee'll dye: and rising so againe, When I shall meet him in the Court of heauen I shall not know him: therefore neuer, neuer Must I behold my pretty Arthur more You hold too heynous a respect of greefe He talkes to me, that neuer had a sonne You are as fond of greefe, as of your childe Greefe fils the roome vp of my absent childe: Lies in his bed, walkes vp and downe with me, Puts on his pretty lookes, repeats his words, Remembers me of all his gracious parts, Stuffes out his vacant garments with his forme; Then, haue I reason to be fond of griefe? Fareyouwell: had you such a losse as I, I could giue better comfort then you doe. I will not keepe this forme vpon my head, When there is such disorder in my witte: O Lord, my boy, my Arthur, my faire sonne, My life, my ioy, my food, my all the world: My widow-comfort, and my sorrowes cure. I feare some out-rage, and Ile follow her. There's nothing in this world can make me ioy, Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale, Vexing the dull eare of a drowsie man; And bitter shame hath spoyl'd the sweet words taste, That it yeelds nought but shame and bitternesse Before the curing of a strong disease, Euen in the instant of repaire and health, The fit is strongest: Euils that take leaue On their departure, most of all shew euill: What haue you lost by losing of this day? All daies of glory, ioy, and happinesse If you had won it, certainely you had. No, no: when Fortune meanes to men most good, Shee lookes vpon them with a threatning eye: 'Tis strange to thinke how much King Iohn hath lost In this which he accounts so clearely wonne: Are not you grieu'd that Arthur is his prisoner? As heartily as he is glad he hath him Your minde is all as youthfull as your blood. Now heare me speake with a propheticke spirit: For euen the breath of what I meane to speake, Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub Out of the path which shall directly lead Thy foote to Englands Throne. And therefore marke: Iohn hath seiz'd Arthur, and it cannot be, That whiles warme life playes in that infants veines, The mis-plac'dIohn should entertaine an houre, One minute, nay one quiet breath of rest. A Scepter snatch'd with an vnruly hand, Must be as boysterously maintain'd as gain'd. And he that stands vpon a slipp'ry place, Makes nice of no vilde hold to stay him vp: That Iohn may stand, then Arthur needs must fall, So be it, for it cannot be but so But what shall I gaine by yong Arthurs fall? You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife, May then make all the claime that Arthur did And loose it, life and all, as Arthur did How green you are, and fresh in this old world? Iohn layes you plots: the times conspire with you, For he that steepes his safetie in true blood, Shall finde but bloodie safety, and vntrue. This Act so euilly borne shall coole the hearts Of all his people, and freeze vp their zeale, That none so small aduantage shall step forth To checke his reigne, but they will cherish it. No naturall exhalation in the skie, No scope of Nature, no distemper'd day, No common winde, no customed euent, But they will plucke away his naturall cause, And call them Meteors, prodigies, and signes, Abbortiues, presages, and tongues of heauen, Plainly denouncing vengeance vpon Iohn May be he will not touch yong Arthurs life, But hold himselfe safe in his prisonment O Sir, when he shall heare of your approach, If that yong Arthur be not gone alreadie, Euen at that newes he dies: and then the hearts Of all his people shall reuolt from him, And kisse the lippes of vnacquainted change, And picke strong matter of reuolt, and wrath Out of the bloody fingers ends of Iohn. Me thinkes I see this hurley all on foot; And O, what better matter breeds for you, Then I haue nam'd. The Bastard Falconbridge Is now in England ransacking the Church, Offending Charity: If but a dozen French Were there in Armes, they would be as a Call To traine ten thousand English to their side; Or, as a little snow, tumbled about, Anon becomes a Mountaine. O noble Dolphine, Go with me to the King, 'tis wonderfull, What may be wrought out of their discontent, Now that their soules are topfull of offence, For England go; I will whet on the King Strong reasons makes strange actions: let vs go, If you say I, the King will not say no. Heate me these Irons hot, and looke thou stand Vpon the bosome of the ground, rush forth And binde the boy, which you shall finde with me Fast to the chaire: be heedfull: hence, and watch I hope your warrant will beare out the deed Vncleanly scruples feare not you: looke too't. Yong Lad come forth; I haue to say with you. Good morrow Hubert Good morrow, little Prince As little Prince, hauing so great a Title To be more Prince, as may be: you are sad Indeed I haue beene merrier 'Mercie on me: Me thinkes no body should be sad but I: Yet I remember, when I was in France, Yong Gentlemen would be as sad as night Onely for wantonnesse: by my Christendome, So I were out of prison, and kept Sheepe I should be as merry as the day is long: And so I would be heere, but that I doubt My Vnckle practises more harme to me: He is affraid of me, and I of him: Is it my fault, that I was Geffreyes sonne? No in deede is't not: and I would to heauen I were your sonne, so you would loue me, Hubert: If I talke to him, with his innocent prate He will awake my mercie, which lies dead: Therefore I will be sodaine, and dispatch Are you sicke Hubert? you looke pale to day, Insooth I would you were a little sicke, That I might sit all night, and watch with you. I warrant I loue you more then you do me His words do take possession of my bosome. Reade heere yong Arthur. How now foolish rheume? Turning dispitious torture out of doore? I must be breefe, least resolution drop Out at mine eyes, in tender womanish teares. Can you not reade it? Is it not faire writ? Too fairely Hubert, for so foule effect, Must you with hot Irons, burne out both mine eyes? Yong Boy, I must And will you? And I will Haue you the heart? When your head did but ake, I knit my hand-kercher about your browes (The best I had, a Princesse wrought it me) And I did neuer aske it you againe: And with my hand, at midnight held your head; And like the watchfull minutes, to the houre, Still and anon cheer'd vp the heauy time; Saying, what lacke you? and where lies your greefe? Or what good loue may I performe for you? Many a poore mans sonne would haue lyen still, And nere haue spoke a louing word to you: But you, at your sicke seruice had a Prince: Nay, you may thinke my loue was craftie loue, And call it cunning. Do, and if you will, If heauen be pleas'd that you must vse me ill, Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes? These eyes, that neuer did, nor neuer shall So much as frowne on you I haue sworne to do it: And with hot Irons must I burne them out Ah, none but in this Iron Age, would do it: The Iron of it selfe, though heate red hot, Approaching neere these eyes, would drinke my teares, And quench this fierie indignation, Euen in the matter of mine innocence: Nay, after that, consume away in rust, But for containing fire to harme mine eye: Are you more stubborne hard, then hammer'd Iron? And if an Angell should haue come to me, And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes, I would not haue beleeu'd him: no tongue but Huberts Come forth: Do as I bid you do O saue me Hubert, saue me: my eyes are out Euen with the fierce lookes of these bloody men Giue me the Iron I say, and binde him heere Alas, what neede you be so boistrous rough? I will not struggle, I will stand stone still: For heauen sake Hubert let me not be bound: Nay heare me Hubert, driue these men away, And I will sit as quiet as a Lambe. I will not stirre, nor winch, nor speake a word, Nor looke vpon the Iron angerly: Thrust but these men away, and Ile forgiue you, What euer torment you do put me too Go stand within: let me alone with him I am best pleas'd to be from such a deede Alas, I then haue chid away my friend, He hath a sterne looke, but a gentle heart: Let him come backe, that his compassion may Giue life to yours Come (Boy) prepare your selfe Is there no remedie? None, but to lose your eyes O heauen: that there were but a moth in yours, A graine, a dust, a gnat, a wandering haire, Any annoyance in that precious sense: Then feeling what small things are boysterous there, Your vilde intent must needs seeme horrible Is this your promise? Go too, hold your toong Hubert, the vtterance of a brace of tongues, Must needes want pleading for a paire of eyes: Let me not hold my tongue: let me not Hubert, Or Hubert, if you will cut out my tongue, So I may keepe mine eyes. O spare mine eyes, Though to no vse, but still to looke on you. Loe, by my troth, the Instrument is cold, And would not harme me I can heate it, Boy No, in good sooth: the fire is dead with griefe, Being create for comfort, to be vs'd In vndeserued extreames: See else your selfe, There is no malice in this burning cole, The breath of heauen, hath blowne his spirit out, And strew'd repentant ashes on his head But with my breath I can reuiue it Boy And if you do, you will but make it blush, And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert: Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes: And, like a dogge that is compell'd to fight, Snatch at his Master that doth tarre him on. All things that you should vse to do me wrong Deny their office: onely you do lacke That mercie, which fierce fire, and Iron extends, Creatures of note for mercy, lacking vses Well, see to liue: I will not touch thine eye, For all the Treasure that thine Vnckle owes, Yet am I sworne, and I did purpose, Boy, With this same very Iron, to burne them out O now you looke like Hubert. All this while You were disguis'd Peace: no more. Adieu, Your Vnckle must not know but you are dead. Ile fill these dogged Spies with false reports: And, pretty childe, sleepe doubtlesse, and secure, That Hubert for the wealth of all the world, Will not offend thee O heauen! I thanke you Hubert Silence, no more; go closely in with mee, Much danger do I vndergo for thee. Scena Secunda. Heere once againe we sit: once against crown'd And look'd vpon, I hope, with chearefull eyes This once again (but that your Highnes pleas'd) Was once superfluous: you were Crown'd before, And that high Royalty was nere pluck'd off: The faiths of men, nere stained with reuolt: Fresh expectation troubled not the Land With any long'd-for-change, or better State Therefore, to be possess'd with double pompe, To guard a Title, that was rich before; To gilde refined Gold, to paint the Lilly; To throw a perfume on the Violet, To smooth the yce, or adde another hew Vnto the Raine-bow; or with Taper-light To seeke the beauteous eye of heauen to garnish, Is wastefull, and ridiculous excesse But that your Royall pleasure must be done, This acte, is as an ancient tale new told, And, in the last repeating, troublesome, Being vrged at a time vnseasonable In this the Anticke, and well noted face Of plaine old forme, is much disfigured, And like a shifted winde vnto a saile, It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about, Startles, and frights consideration: Makes sound opinion sicke, and truth suspected, For putting on so new a fashion'd robe When Workemen striue to do better then wel, They do confound their skill in couetousnesse, And oftentimes excusing of a fault, Doth make the fault the worse by th' excuse: As patches set vpon a little breach, Discredite more in hiding of the fault, Then did the fault before it was so patch'd To this effect, before you were new crown'd We breath'd our Councell: but it pleas'd your Highnes To ouer-beare it, and we are all well pleas'd, Since all, and euery part of what we would Doth make a stand, at what your Highnesse will Some reasons of this double Corronation I haue possest you with, and thinke them strong. And more, more strong, then lesser is my feare I shall indue you with: Meane time, but aske What you would haue reform'd, that is not well, And well shall you perceiue, how willingly I will both heare, and grant you your requests Then I, as one that am the tongue of these To sound the purposes of all their hearts, Both for my selfe, and them: but chiefe of all Your safety: for the which, my selfe and them Bend their best studies, heartily request Th' infranchisement of Arthur, whose restraint Doth moue the murmuring lips of discontent To breake into this dangerous argument. If what in rest you haue, in right you hold, Why then your feares, which (as they say) attend The steppes of wrong, should moue you to mew vp Your tender kinsman, and to choake his dayes With barbarous ignorance, and deny his youth The rich aduantage of good exercise, That the times enemies may not haue this To grace occasions: let it be our suite, That you haue bid vs aske his libertie, Which for our goods, we do no further aske, Then, whereupon our weale on you depending, Counts it your weale: he haue his liberty. Let it be so: I do commit his youth To your direction: Hubert, what newes with you? This is the man should do the bloody deed: He shew'd his warrant to a friend of mine, The image of a wicked heynous fault Liues in his eye: that close aspect of his, Do shew the mood of a much troubled brest, And I do fearefully beleeue 'tis done, What we so fear'd he had a charge to do The colour of the King doth come, and go Betweene his purpose and his conscience, Like Heralds 'twixt two dreadfull battailes set: His passion is so ripe, it needs must breake And when it breakes, I feare will issue thence The foule corruption of a sweet childes death We cannot hold mortalities strong hand. Good Lords, although my will to giue, is liuing, The suite which you demand is gone, and dead. He tels vs Arthur is deceas'd to night Indeed we fear'd his sicknesse was past cure Indeed we heard how neere his death he was, Before the childe himselfe felt he was sicke: This must be answer'd either heere, or hence Why do you bend such solemne browes on me? Thinke you I beare the Sheeres of destiny? Haue I commandement on the pulse of life? It is apparant foule-play, and 'tis shame That Greatnesse should so grossely offer it; So thriue it in your game, and so farewell Stay yet (Lord Salisbury) Ile go with thee, And finde th' inheritance of this poore childe, His little kingdome of a forced graue. That blood which ow'd the bredth of all this Ile, Three foot of it doth hold; bad world the while: This must not be thus borne, this will breake out To all our sorrowes, and ere long I doubt. They burn in indignation: I repent: There is no sure foundation set on blood: No certaine life atchieu'd by others death: A fearefull eye thou hast. Where is that blood, That I haue seene inhabite in those cheekes? So foule a skie, cleeres not without a storme, Poure downe thy weather: how goes all in France? From France to England, neuer such a powre For any forraigne preparation, Was leuied in the body of a land. The Copie of your speede is learn'd by them: For when you should be told they do prepare, The tydings comes, that they are all arriu'd Oh where hath our Intelligence bin drunke? Where hath it slept? Where is my Mothers care? That such an Army could be drawne in France, And she not heare of it? My Liege, her eare Is stopt with dust: the first of Aprill di'de Your noble mother; and as I heare, my Lord, The Lady Constance in a frenzie di'de Three dayes before: but this from Rumors tongue I idely heard: if true, or false I know not With-hold thy speed, dreadfull Occasion: O make a league with me, 'till I haue pleas'd My discontented Peeres. What? Mother dead? How wildely then walkes my Estate in France? Vnder whose conduct came those powres of France, That thou for truth giu'st out are landed heere? Vnder the Dolphin. Thou hast made me giddy With these ill tydings: Now? What sayes the world To your proceedings? Do not seeke to stuffe My head with more ill newes: for it is full But if you be a-feard to heare the worst, Then let the worst vn-heard, fall on your head Beare with me Cosen, for I was amaz'd Vnder the tide; but now I breath againe Aloft the flood, and can giue audience To any tongue, speake it of what it will How I haue sped among the Clergy men, The summes I haue collected shall expresse: But as I trauail'd hither through the land, I finde the people strangely fantasied, Possest with rumors, full of idle dreames, Not knowing what they feare, but full of feare. And here's a Prophet that I brought with me From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found With many hundreds treading on his heeles: To whom he sung in rude harsh sounding rimes, That ere the next Ascension day at noone, Your Highnes should deliuer vp your Crowne Thou idle Dreamer, wherefore didst thou so? Fore-knowing that the truth will fall out so Hubert, away with him: imprison him, And on that day at noone, whereon he sayes I shall yeeld vp my Crowne, let him be hang'd Deliuer him to safety, and returne, For I must vse thee. O my gentle Cosen, Hear'st thou the newes abroad, who are arriu'd? The French (my Lord) mens mouths are ful of it: Besides I met Lord Bigot, and Lord Salisburie With eyes as red as new enkindled fire, And others more, going to seeke the graue Of Arthur, whom they say is kill'd to night, on your suggestion Gentle kinsman, go And thrust thy selfe into their Companies, I haue a way to winne their loues againe: Bring them before me I will seeke them out Nay, but make haste: the better foote before. O, let me haue no subiect enemies, When aduerse Forreyners affright my Townes With dreadfull pompe of stout inuasion. Be Mercurie, set feathers to thy heeles, And flye (like thought) from them, to me againe The spirit of the time shall teach me speed. Spoke like a sprightfull Noble Gentleman. Go after him: for he perhaps shall neede Some Messenger betwixt me, and the Peeres, And be thou hee With all my heart, my Liege My mother dead? My Lord, they say fiue Moones were seene to night: Foure fixed, and the fift did whirle about The other foure, in wondrous motion Fiue Moones? Old men, and Beldames, in the streets Do prophesie vpon it dangerously: Yong Arthurs death is common in their mouths, And when they talke of him, they shake their heads, And whisper one another in the eare. And he that speakes, doth gripe the hearers wrist, Whilst he that heares, makes fearefull action With wrinkled browes, with nods, with rolling eyes. I saw a Smith stand with his hammer (thus) The whilst his Iron did on the Anuile coole, With open mouth swallowing a Taylors newes, Who with his Sheeres, and Measure in his hand, Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste Had falsely thrust vpon contrary feete, Told of a many thousand warlike French, That were embattailed, and rank'd in Kent. Another leane, vnwash'd Artificer, Cuts off his tale, and talkes of Arthurs death Why seek'st thou to possesse me with these feares? Why vrgest thou so oft yong Arthurs death? Thy hand hath murdred him: I had a mighty cause To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him No had (my Lord?) why, did you not prouoke me? It is the curse of Kings, to be attended By slaues, that take their humors for a warrant, To breake within the bloody house of life, And on the winking of Authoritie To vnderstand a Law; to know the meaning Of dangerous Maiesty, when perchance it frownes More vpon humor, then aduis'd respect Heere is your hand and Seale for what I did Oh, when the last accompt twixt heauen & earth Is to be made, then shall this hand and Seale Witnesse against vs to damnation. How oft the sight of meanes to do ill deeds, Make deeds ill done? Had'st not thou beene by, A fellow by the hand of Nature mark'd, Quoted, and sign'd to do a deede of shame, This murther had not come into my minde. But taking note of thy abhorr'd Aspect, Finding thee fit for bloody villanie: Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger, I faintly broke with thee of Arthurs death: And thou, to be endeered to a King, Made it no conscience to destroy a Prince My Lord Had'st thou but shooke thy head, or made a pause When I spake darkely, what I purposed: Or turn'd an eye of doubt vpon my face; As bid me tell my tale in expresse words: Deepe shame had struck me dumbe, made me break off, And those thy feares, might haue wrought feares in me. But, thou didst vnderstand me by my signes, And didst in signes againe parley with sinne, Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent, And consequently, thy rude hand to acte The deed, which both our tongues held vilde to name. Out of my sight, and neuer see me more: My Nobles leaue me, and my State is braued, Euen at my gates, with rankes of forraigne powres; Nay, in the body of this fleshly Land, This kingdome, this Confine of blood, and breathe Hostilitie, and ciuill tumult reignes Betweene my conscience, and my Cosins death Arme you against your other enemies: Ile make a peace betweene your soule, and you. Yong Arthur is aliue: This hand of mine Is yet a maiden, and an innocent hand. Not painted with the Crimson spots of blood, The dreadfull motion of a murderous thought, And you haue slander'd Nature in my forme, Which howsoeuer rude exteriorly, Is yet the couer of a fayrer minde, Then to be butcher of an innocent childe Doth Arthur liue? O hast thee to the Peeres, Throw this report on their incensed rage, And make them tame to their obedience. Forgiue the Comment that my passion made Vpon thy feature, for my rage was blinde, And foule immaginarie eyes of blood Presented thee more hideous then thou art. Oh, answer not; but to my Closset bring The angry Lords, with all expedient hast, I coniure thee but slowly: run more fast. Scoena Tertia. The Wall is high, and yet will I leape downe. Good ground be pittifull, and hurt me not: There's few or none do know me, if they did, This Ship-boyes semblance hath disguis'd me quite. I am afraide, and yet Ile venture it. If I get downe, and do not breake my limbes, Ile finde a thousand shifts to get away; As good to dye, and go; as dye, and stay. Oh me, my Vnckles spirit is in these stones, Heauen take my soule, and England keep my bones. Dies Lords, I will meet him at S. Edmondsbury, It is our safetie, and we must embrace This gentle offer of the perillous time Who brought that Letter from the Cardinall? The Count Meloone, a Noble Lord of France, Whose priuate with me of the Dolphines loue, Is much more generall, then these lines import To morrow morning let vs meete him then Or rather then set forward, for 'twill be Two long dayes iourney (Lords) or ere we meete. Once more to day well met, distemper'd Lords, The King by me requests your presence straight The king hath dispossest himselfe of vs, We will not lyne his thin-bestained cloake With our pure Honors: nor attend the foote That leaues the print of blood where ere it walkes. Returne, and tell him so: we know the worst What ere you thinke, good words I thinke were best Our greefes, and not our manners reason now But there is little reason in your greefe. Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now Sir, sir, impatience hath his priuiledge 'Tis true, to hurt his master, no mans else This is the prison: What is he lyes heere? Oh death, made proud with pure & princely beuty, The earth had not a hole to hide this deede Murther, as hating what himselfe hath done, Doth lay it open to vrge on reuenge Or when he doom'd this Beautie to a graue, Found it too precious Princely, for a graue Sir Richard, what thinke you? you haue beheld, Or haue you read, or heard, or could you thinke? Or do you almost thinke, although you see, That you do see? Could thought, without this obiect Forme such another? This is the very top, The heighth, the Crest: or Crest vnto the Crest Of murthers Armes: This is the bloodiest shame, The wildest Sauagery, the vildest stroke That euer wall-ey'd wrath, or staring rage Presented to the teares of soft remorse All murthers past, do stand excus'd in this: And this so sole, and so vnmatcheable, Shall giue a holinesse, a puritie, To the yet vnbegotten sinne of times; And proue a deadly bloodshed, but a iest, Exampled by this heynous spectacle It is a damned, and a bloody worke, The gracelesse action of a heauy hand, If that it be the worke of any hand If that it be the worke of any hand? We had a kinde of light, what would ensue: It is the shamefull worke of Huberts hand, The practice, and the purpose of the king: From whose obedience I forbid my soule, Kneeling before this ruine of sweete life, And breathing to his breathlesse Excellence The Incense of a Vow, a holy Vow: Neuer to taste the pleasures of the world, Neuer to be infected with delight, Nor conuersant with Ease, and Idlenesse, Till I haue set a glory to this hand, By giuing it the worship of Reuenge Big. Our soules religiously confirme thy words. Lords, I am hot with haste, in seeking you, Arthur doth liue, the king hath sent for you Oh he is bold, and blushes not at death, Auant thou hatefull villain, get thee gone I am no villaine Must I rob the Law? Your sword is bright sir, put it vp againe Not till I sheath it in a murtherers skin Stand backe Lord Salsbury, stand backe I say By heauen, I thinke my sword's as sharpe as yours. I would not haue you (Lord) forget your selfe, Nor tempt the danger of my true defence; Least I, by marking of your rage, forget Your Worth, your Greatnesse, and Nobility Out dunghill: dar'st thou braue a Nobleman? Not for my life: But yet I dare defend My innocent life against an Emperor Thou art a Murtherer Do not proue me so: Yet I am none. Whose tongue so ere speakes false, Not truely speakes: who speakes not truly, Lies Cut him to peeces Keepe the peace, I say Stand by, or I shall gaul you Faulconbridge Thou wer't better gaul the diuell Salsbury. If thou but frowne on me, or stirre thy foote, Or teach thy hastie spleene to do me shame, Ile strike thee dead. Put vp thy sword betime, Or Ile so maule you, and your tosting-Iron, That you shall thinke the diuell is come from hell What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge? Second a Villaine, and a Murtherer? Lord Bigot, I am none Who kill'd this Prince? 'Tis not an houre since I left him well: I honour'd him, I lou'd him, and will weepe My date of life out, for his sweete liues losse Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes, For villanie is not without such rheume, And he, long traded in it, makes it seeme Like Riuers of remorse and innocencie. Away with me, all you whose soules abhorre Th' vncleanly sauours of a Slaughter-house, For I am stifled with this smell of sinne Away, toward Burie, to the Dolphin there There tel the king, he may inquire vs out. Lords. Here's a good world: knew you of this faire work? Beyond the infinite and boundlesse reach of mercie, (If thou didst this deed of death) art y damn'd Hubert Do but heare me sir Ha? Ile tell thee what. Thou'rt damn'd as blacke, nay nothing is so blacke, Thou art more deepe damn'd then Prince Lucifer: There is not yet so vgly a fiend of hell As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this childe Vpon my soule If thou didst but consent To this most cruell Act: do but dispaire, And if thou want'st a Cord, the smallest thred That euer Spider twisted from her wombe Will serue to strangle thee: A rush will be a beame To hang thee on. Or wouldst thou drowne thy selfe, Put but a little water in a spoone, And it shall be as all the Ocean, Enough to stifle such a villaine vp. I do suspect thee very greeuously If I in act, consent, or sinne of thought, Be guiltie of the stealing that sweete breath Which was embounded in this beauteous clay, Let hell want paines enough to torture me: I left him well Go, beare him in thine armes: I am amaz'd me thinkes, and loose my way Among the thornes, and dangers of this world. How easie dost thou take all England vp, From forth this morcell of dead Royaltie? The life, the right, and truth of all this Realme Is fled to heauen: and England now is left To tug and scamble, and to part by th' teeth The vn-owed interest of proud swelling State: Now for the bare-pickt bone of Maiesty, Doth dogged warre bristle his angry crest, And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace: Now Powers from home, and discontents at home Meet in one line: and vast confusion waites As doth a Rauen on a sicke-falne beast, The iminent decay of wrested pompe. Now happy he, whose cloake and center can Hold out this tempest. Beare away that childe, And follow me with speed: Ile to the King: A thousand businesses are briefe in hand, And heauen it selfe doth frowne vpon the Land. Iohn. Thus haue I yeelded vp into your hand The Circle of my glory Take againe From this my hand, as holding of the Pope Your Soueraigne greatnesse and authoritie Now keep your holy word, go meet the French, And from his holinesse vse all your power To stop their marches 'fore we are enflam'd: Our discontented Counties doe reuolt: Our people quarrell with obedience, Swearing Allegiance, and the loue of soule To stranger-bloud, to forren Royalty; This inundation of mistempred humor, Rests by you onely to be qualified. Then pause not: for the present time's so sicke, That present medcine must be ministred, Or ouerthrow incureable ensues It was my breath that blew this Tempest vp, Vpon your stubborne vsage of the Pope: But since you are a gentle conuertite, My tongue shall hush againe this storme of warre, And make faire weather in your blustring land: On this Ascention day, remember well, Vpon your oath of seruice to the Pope, Goe I to make the French lay downe their Armes. Is this Ascension day? did not the Prophet Say, that before Ascension day at noone, My Crowne I should giue off? euen so I haue: I did suppose it should be on constraint, But (heau'n be thank'd) it is but voluntary. All Kent hath yeelded: nothing there holds out But Douer Castle: London hath receiu'd Like a kinde Host, the Dolphin and his powers. Your Nobles will not heare you, but are gone To offer seruice to your enemy: And wilde amazement hurries vp and downe The little number of your doubtfull friends Would not my Lords returne to me againe After they heard yong Arthur was aliue? They found him dead, and cast into the streets, An empty Casket, where the Iewell of life By some damn'd hand was rob'd, and tane away That villaine Hubert told me he did liue So on my soule he did, for ought he knew: But wherefore doe you droope? why looke you sad? Be great in act, as you haue beene in thought: Let not the world see feare and sad distrust Gouerne the motion of a kinglye eye: Be stirring as the time, be fire with fire, Threaten the threatner, and out-face the brow Of bragging horror: So shall inferior eyes That borrow their behauiours from the great, Grow great by your example, and put on The dauntlesse spirit of resolution. Away, and glister like the god of warre When he intendeth to become the field: Shew boldnesse and aspiring confidence: What, shall they seeke the Lion in his denne, And fright him there? and make him tremble there? Oh let it not be said: forrage, and runne To meet displeasure farther from the dores, And grapple with him ere he come so nye The Legat of the Pope hath beene with mee, And I haue made a happy peace with him, And he hath promis'd to dismisse the Powers Led by the Dolphin Oh inglorious league: Shall we vpon the footing of our land, Send fayre-play-orders, and make comprimise, Insinuation, parley, and base truce To Armes Inuasiue? Shall a beardlesse boy, A cockred-silken wanton braue our fields, And flesh his spirit in a warre-like soyle, Mocking the ayre with colours idlely spred, And finde no checke? Let vs my Liege to Armes: Perchance the Cardinall cannot make your peace; Or if he doe, let it at least be said They saw we had a purpose of defence Haue thou the ordering of this present time Away then with good courage: yet I know Our Partie may well meet a prowder foe. Scoena Secunda. My Lord Melloone, let this be coppied out, And keepe it safe for our remembrance: Returne the president to these Lords againe, That hauing our faire order written downe, Both they and we, perusing ore these notes May know wherefore we tooke the Sacrament, And keepe our faithes firme and inuiolable Vpon our sides it neuer shall be broken. And Noble Dolphin, albeit we sweare A voluntary zeale, and an vn-urg'd Faith To your proceedings: yet beleeue me Prince, I am not glad that such a sore of Time Should seeke a plaster by contemn'd reuolt, And heale the inueterate Canker of one wound, By making many: Oh it grieues my soule, That I must draw this mettle from my side To be a widdow-maker: oh, and there Where honourable rescue, and defence Cries out vpon the name of Salisbury. But such is the infection of the time, That for the health and Physicke of our right, We cannot deale but with the very hand Of sterne Iniustice, and confused wrong: And is't not pitty, (oh my grieued friends) That we, the sonnes and children of this Isle, Was borne to see so sad an houre as this, Wherein we step after a stranger, march Vpon her gentle bosom, and fill vp Her Enemies rankes? I must withdraw, and weepe Vpon the spot of this inforced cause, To grace the Gentry of a Land remote, And follow vnacquainted colours heere: What heere? O Nation that thou couldst remoue, That Neptunes Armes who clippeth thee about, Would beare thee from the knowledge of thy selfe, And cripple thee vnto a Pagan shore, Where these two Christian Armies might combine The bloud of malice, in a vaine of league, And not to spend it so vn-neighbourly A noble temper dost thou shew in this, And great affections wrastling in thy bosome Doth make an earth-quake of Nobility: Oh, what a noble combat hast fought Between compulsion, and a braue respect: Let me wipe off this honourable dewe, That siluerly doth progresse on thy cheekes: My heart hath melted at a Ladies teares, Being an ordinary Inundation: But this effusion of such manly drops, This showre, blowne vp by tempest of the soule, Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amaz'd Then had I seene the vaultie top of heauen Figur'd quite ore with burning Meteors. Lift vp thy brow (renowned Salisburie) And with a great heart heaue away this storme: Commend these waters to those baby-eyes That neuer saw the giant-world enrag'd, Nor met with Fortune, other then at feasts, Full warm of blood, of mirth, of gossipping: Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deepe Into the purse of rich prosperity As Lewis himselfe: so (Nobles) shall you all, That knit your sinewes to the strength of mine. And euen there, methinkes an Angell spake, Looke where the holy Legate comes apace, To giue vs warrant from the hand of heauen, And on our actions set the name of right With holy breath Haile noble Prince of France: The next is this: King Iohn hath reconcil'd Himselfe to Rome, his spirit is come in, That so stood out against the holy Church, The great Metropolis and Sea of Rome: Therefore thy threatning Colours now winde vp, And tame the sauage spirit of wilde warre, That like a Lion fostered vp at hand, It may lie gently at the foot of peace, And be no further harmefull then in shewe Your Grace shall pardon me, I will not backe: I am too high-borne to be proportied To be a secondary at controll, Or vsefull seruing-man, and Instrument To any Soueraigne State throughout the world. Your breath first kindled the dead coale of warres, Betweene this chastiz'd kingdome and my selfe, And brought in matter that should feed this fire; And now 'tis farre too huge to be blowne out With that same weake winde, which enkindled it: You taught me how to know the face of right, Acquainted me with interest to this Land, Yea, thrust this enterprize into my heart, And come ye now to tell me Iohn hath made His peace with Rome? what is that peace to me? I (by the honour of my marriage bed) After yong Arthur, claime this Land for mine, And now it is halfe conquer'd, must I backe, Because that Iohn hath made his peace with Rome? Am I Romes slaue? What penny hath Rome borne? What men prouided? What munition sent To vnder-prop this Action? Is't not I That vnder-goe this charge? Who else but I, And such as to my claime are liable, Sweat in this businesse, and maintaine this warre? Haue I not heard these Islanders shout out Viue le Roy, as I haue bank'd their Townes? Haue I not heere the best Cards for the game To winne this easie match, plaid for a Crowne? And shall I now giue ore the yeelded Set? No, no, on my soule it neuer shall be said You looke but on the out-side of this worke Out-side or in-side, I will not returne Till my attempt so much be glorified, As to my ample hope was promised, Before I drew this gallant head of warre, And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world To out-looke Conquest, and to winne renowne Euen in the iawes of danger, and of death: What lusty Trumpet thus doth summon vs? According to the faire-play of the world, Let me haue audience: I am sent to speake: My holy Lord of Millane, from the King I come to learne how you haue dealt for him: And, as you answer, I doe know the scope And warrant limited vnto my tongue The Dolphin is too wilfull opposite And will not temporize with my intreaties: He flatly saies, hee'll not lay downe his Armes By all the bloud that euer fury breath'd, The youth saies well. Now heare our English King, For thus his Royaltie doth speake in me: He is prepar'd, and reason to he should, This apish and vnmannerly approach, This harness'd Maske, and vnaduised Reuell, This vn-heard sawcinesse and boyish Troopes, The King doth smile at, and is well prepar'd To whip this dwarfish warre, this Pigmy Armes From out the circle of his Territories. That hand which had the strength, euen at your dore, To cudgell you, and make you take the hatch, To diue like Buckets in concealed Welles, To crowch in litter of your stable plankes, To lye like pawnes, lock'd vp in chests and truncks, To hug with swine, to seeke sweet safety out In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake, Euen at the crying of your Nations crow, Thinking this voyce an armed Englishman. Shall that victorious hand be feebled heere, That in your Chambers gaue you chasticement? No: know the gallant Monarch is in Armes, And like an Eagle, o're his ayerie towres, To sowsse annoyance that comes neere his Nest; And you degenerate, you ingrate Reuolts, You bloudy Nero's, ripping vp the wombe Of your deere Mother-England: blush for shame: For your owne Ladies, and pale-visag'd Maides, Like Amazons, come tripping after drummes: Their thimbles into armed Gantlets change, Their Needl's to Lances, and their gentle hearts To fierce and bloody inclination There end thy braue, and turn thy face in peace, We grant thou canst out-scold vs: Far thee well, We hold our time too precious to be spent with such a brabler Giue me leaue to speake No, I will speake We will attend to neyther: Strike vp the drummes, and let the tongue of warre Pleade for our interest, and our being heere Indeede your drums being beaten, wil cry out; And so shall you, being beaten: Do but start An eccho with the clamor of thy drumme, And euen at hand, a drumme is readie brac'd, That shall reuerberate all, as lowd as thine. Sound but another, and another shall (As lowd as thine) rattle the Welkins eare, And mocke the deepe mouth'd Thunder: for at hand (Not trusting to this halting Legate heere, Whom he hath vs'd rather for sport, then neede) Is warlike Iohn: and in his fore-head sits A bare-rib'd death, whose office is this day To feast vpon whole thousands of the French Strike vp our drummes, to finde this danger out And thou shalt finde it (Dolphin) do not doubt Scaena Tertia. How goes the day with vs? oh tell me Hubert Badly I feare; how fares your Maiesty? This Feauer that hath troubled me so long, Lyes heauie on me: oh, my heart is sicke. My Lord: your valiant kinsman Falconbridge, Desires your Maiestie to leaue the field, And send him word by me, which way you go Tell him toward Swinsted, to the Abbey there Be of good comfort: for the great supply That was expected by the Dolphin heere, Are wrack'd three nights ago on Goodwin sands. This newes was brought to Richard but euen now, The French fight coldly, and retyre themselues Aye me, this tyrant Feauer burnes mee vp, And will not let me welcome this good newes. Set on toward Swinsted: to my Litter straight, Weaknesse possesseth me, and I am faint. Scena Quarta. I did not thinke the King so stor'd with friends Vp once againe: put spirit in the French, If they miscarry: we miscarry too That misbegotten diuell Falconbridge, In spight of spight, alone vpholds the day They say King Iohn sore sick, hath left the field. Lead me to the Reuolts of England heere When we were happie, we had other names It is the Count Meloone Wounded to death Fly Noble English, you are bought and sold, Vnthred the rude eye of Rebellion, And welcome home againe discarded faith, Seeke out King Iohn, and fall before his feete: For if the French be Lords of this loud day, He meanes to recompence the paines you take, By cutting off your heads: Thus hath he sworne, And I with him, and many moe with mee, Vpon the Altar at S. Edmondsbury, Euen on that Altar, where we swore to you Deere Amity, and euerlasting loue May this be possible? May this be true? Haue I not hideous death within my view, Retaining but a quantity of life, Which bleeds away, euen as a forme of waxe Resolueth from his figure 'gainst the fire? What in the world should make me now deceiue, Since I must loose the vse of all deceite? Why should I then be false, since it is true That I must dye heere, and liue hence, by Truth? I say againe, if Lewis do win the day, He is forsworne, if ere those eyes of yours Behold another day breake in the East: But euen this night, whose blacke contagious breath Already smoakes about the burning Crest Of the old, feeble, and day-wearied Sunne, Euen this ill night, your breathing shall expire, Paying the fine of rated Treachery, Euen with a treacherous fine of all your liues: If Lewis, by your assistance win the day. Commend me to one Hubert, with your King; The loue of him, and this respect besides (For that my Grandsire was an Englishman) Awakes my Conscience to confesse all this. In lieu whereof, I pray you beare me hence From forth the noise and rumour of the Field; Where I may thinke the remnant of my thoughts In peace: and part this bodie and my soule With contemplation, and deuout desires We do beleeue thee, and beshrew my soule, But I do loue the fauour, and the forme Of this most faire occasion, by the which We will vntread the steps of damned flight, And like a bated and retired Flood, Leauing our ranknesse and irregular course, Stoope lowe within those bounds we haue ore-look'd, And calmely run on in obedience Euen to our Ocean, to our great King Iohn. My arme shall giue thee helpe to beare thee hence, For I do see the cruell pangs of death Right in thine eye. Away, my friends, new flight, And happie newnesse, that intends old right. Scena Quinta. The Sun of heauen (me thought) was loth to set; But staid, and made the Westerne Welkin blush, When English measure backward their owne ground In faint Retire: Oh brauely came we off, When with a volley of our needlesse shot, After such bloody toile, we bid good night, And woon'd our tott'ring colours clearly vp, Last in the field, and almost Lords of it. Where is my Prince, the Dolphin? Heere: what newes? The Count Meloone is slaine: The English Lords By his perswasion, are againe falne off, And your supply, which you haue wish'd so long, Are cast away, and sunke on Goodwin sands Ah fowle, shrew'd newes. Beshrew thy very hart: I did not thinke to be so sad to night As this hath made me. Who was he that said King Iohn did flie an houre or two before The stumbling night did part our wearie powres? Who euer spoke it, it is true my Lord Well: keepe good quarter, & good care to night, The day shall not be vp so soone as I, To try the faire aduenture of to morrow. Scena Sexta. Whose there? Speake hoa, speake quickely, or I shoote A Friend. What art thou? Of the part of England Whether doest thou go? What's that to thee? Why may not I demand of thine affaires, As well as thou of mine? Hubert, I thinke Thou hast a perfect thought: I will vpon all hazards well beleeue Thou art my friend, that know'st my tongue so well: Who art thou? Who thou wilt: and if thou please Thou maist be-friend me so much, as to thinke I come one way of the Plantagenets Vnkinde remembrance: thou, & endles night, Haue done me shame: Braue Soldier, pardon me, That any accent breaking from thy tongue, Should scape the true acquaintance of mine eare Come, come: sans complement, What newes abroad? Why heere walke I in the black brow of night To finde you out Breefe then: and what's the newes? O my sweet sir, newes fitting to the night, Blacke, fearefull, comfortlesse, and horrible Shew me the very wound of this ill newes, I am no woman, Ile not swound at it The King I feare is poyson'd by a Monke, I left him almost speechlesse, and broke out To acquaint you with this euill, that you might The better arme you to the sodaine time, Then if you had at leisure knowne of this How did he take it? Who did taste to him? A Monke I tell you, a resolued villaine Whose Bowels sodainly burst out: The King Yet speakes, and peraduenture may recouer Who didst thou leaue to tend his Maiesty? Why know you not? The Lords are all come backe, And brought Prince Henry in their companie, At whose request the king hath pardon'd them, And they are all about his Maiestie With-hold thine indignation, mighty heauen, And tempt vs not to beare aboue our power. Ile tell thee Hubert, halfe my power this night Passing these Flats, are taken by the Tide, These Lincolne-Washes haue deuoured them, My selfe, well mounted, hardly haue escap'd. Away before: Conduct me to the king, I doubt he will be dead, or ere I come. Scena Septima. It is too late, the life of all his blood Is touch'd, corruptibly: and his pure braine (Which some suppose the soules fraile dwelling house) Doth by the idle Comments that it makes, Fore-tell the ending of mortality. His Highnesse yet doth speak, & holds beleefe, That being brought into the open ayre, It would allay the burning qualitie Of that fell poison which assayleth him Let him be brought into the Orchard heere: Doth he still rage? He is more patient Then when you left him; euen now he sung Oh vanity of sicknesse: fierce extreames In their continuance, will not feele themselues. Death hauing praide vpon the outward parts Leaues them inuisible, and his seige is now Against the winde, the which he prickes and wounds With many legions of strange fantasies, Which in their throng, and presse to that last hold, Counfound themselues. 'Tis strange y death shold sing: I am the Symet to this pale faint Swan, Who chaunts a dolefull hymne to his owne death, And from the organ-pipe of frailety sings His soule and body to their lasting rest Be of good comfort (Prince) for you are borne To set a forme vpon that indigest Which he hath left so shapelesse, and so rude. Iohn brought in. I marrie, now my soule hath elbow roome, It would not out at windowes, nor at doores, There is so hot a summer in my bosome, That all my bowels crumble vp to dust: I am a scribled forme drawne with a pen Vpon a Parchment, and against this fire Do I shrinke vp How fares your Maiesty? Poyson'd, ill fare: dead, forsooke, cast off, And none of you will bid the winter come To thrust his ycie fingers in my maw; Nor let my kingdomes Riuers take their course Through my burn'd bosome: nor intreat the North To make his bleake windes kisse my parched lips, And comfort me with cold. I do not aske you much, I begge cold comfort: and you are so straight And so ingratefull, you deny me that Oh that there were some vertue in my teares, That might releeue you The salt in them is hot. Is, as a fiend, confin'd to tyrannize, On vnrepreeuable condemned blood. Oh, I am scalded with my violent motion And spleene of speede, to see your Maiesty Oh Cozen, thou art come to set mine eye: The tackle of my heart, is crack'd and burnt, And all the shrowds wherewith my life should saile, Are turned to one thred, one little haire: My heart hath one poore string to stay it by, Which holds but till thy newes be vttered, And then all this thou seest, is but a clod, And module of confounded royalty The Dolphin is preparing hither-ward, Where heauen he knowes how we shall answer him. For in a night the best part of my powre, As I vpon aduantage did remoue, Were in the Washes all vnwarily, Deuoured by the vnexpected flood You breath these dead newes in as dead an eare My Liege, my Lord: but now a King, now thus Euen so must I run on, and euen so stop. What surety of the world, what hope, what stay, When this was now a King, and now is clay? Art thou gone so? I do but stay behinde, To do the office for thee, of reuenge, And then my soule shall waite on thee to heauen, As it on earth hath bene thy seruant still. Now, now you Starres, that moue in your right spheres, Where be your powres? Shew now your mended faiths, And instantly returne with me againe. To push destruction, and perpetuall shame Out of the weake doore of our fainting Land: Straight let vs seeke, or straight we shall be sought, The Dolphine rages at our verie heeles It seemes you know not then so much as we, The Cardinall Pandulph is within at rest, Who halfe an houre since came from the Dolphin, And brings from him such offers of our peace, As we with honor and respect may take, With purpose presently to leaue this warre He will the rather do it, when he sees Our selues well sinew'd to our defence Nay, 'tis in a manner done already, For many carriages hee hath dispatch'd To the sea side, and put his cause and quarrell To the disposing of the Cardinall, With whom your selfe, my selfe, and other Lords, If you thinke meete, this afternoone will poast To consummate this businesse happily Let it be so, and you my noble Prince, With other Princes that may best be spar'd, Shall waite vpon your Fathers Funerall At Worster must his bodie be interr'd, For so he will'd it Thither shall it then, And happily may your sweet selfe put on The lineall state, and glorie of the Land, To whom with all submission on my knee, I do bequeath my faithfull seruices And true subiection euerlastingly And the like tender of our loue wee make To rest without a spot for euermore I haue a kinde soule, that would giue thankes, And knowes not how to do it, but with teares Oh let vs pay the time: but needfull woe, Since it hath beene before hand with our greefes. This England neuer did, nor neuer shall Lye at the proud foote of a Conqueror, But when it first did helpe to wound it selfe. Now, these her Princes are come home againe, Come the three corners of the world in Armes, And we shall shocke them: Naught shall make vs rue, If England to it selfe, do rest but true. King Richard. Old Iohn of Gaunt, time-honoured Lancaster, Hast thou according to thy oath and band Brought hither Henry Herford thy bold son: Heere to make good y boistrous late appeale, Which then our leysure would not let vs heare, Against the Duke of Norfolke, Thomas Mowbray? I haue my Liege Tell me moreouer, hast thou sounded him, If he appeale the Duke on ancient malice, Or worthily as a good subiect should On some knowne ground of treacherie in him As neere as I could sift him on that argument, On some apparant danger seene in him, Aym'd at your Highnesse, no inueterate malice Then call them to our presence face to face, And frowning brow to brow, our selues will heare Th' accuser, and the accused, freely speake; High stomack'd are they both, and full of ire, In rage, deafe as the sea; hastie as fire. Many yeares of happy dayes befall My gracious Soueraigne, my most louing Liege Each day still better others happinesse, Vntill the heauens enuying earths good hap, Adde an immortall title to your Crowne We thanke you both, yet one but flatters vs, As well appeareth by the cause you come, Namely, to appeale each other of high treason. Coosin of Hereford, what dost thou obiect Against the Duke of Norfolke, Thomas Mowbray? First, heauen be the record to my speech, In the deuotion of a subiects loue, Tendering the precious safetie of my Prince, And free from other misbegotten hate, Come I appealant to this Princely presence. Now Thomas Mowbray do I turne to thee, And marke my greeting well: for what I speake, My body shall make good vpon this earth, Or my diuine soule answer it in heauen. Thou art a Traitor, and a Miscreant; Too good to be so, and too bad to liue, Since the more faire and christall is the skie, The vglier seeme the cloudes that in it flye: Once more, the more to aggrauate the note, With a foule Traitors name stuffe I thy throte, And wish (so please my Soueraigne) ere I moue, What my tong speaks, my right drawn sword may proue Let not my cold words heere accuse my zeale: 'Tis not the triall of a Womans warre, The bitter clamour of two eager tongues, Can arbitrate this cause betwixt vs twaine: The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this. Yet can I not of such tame patience boast, As to be husht, and nought at all to say. First the faire reuerence of your Highnesse curbes mee, From giuing reines and spurres to my free speech, Which else would post, vntill it had return'd These tearmes of treason, doubly downe his throat. Setting aside his high bloods royalty, And let him be no Kinsman to my Liege, I do defie him, and I spit at him, Call him a slanderous Coward, and a Villaine: Which to maintaine, I would allow him oddes, And meete him, were I tide to runne afoote, Euen to the frozen ridges of the Alpes, Or any other ground inhabitable, Where euer Englishman durst set his foote. Meane time, let this defend my loyaltie, By all my hopes most falsely doth he lie Pale trembling Coward, there I throw my gage, Disclaiming heere the kindred of a King, And lay aside my high bloods Royalty, Which feare, not reuerence makes thee to except. If guilty dread hath left thee so much strength, As to take vp mine Honors pawne, then stoope. By that, and all the rites of Knight-hood else, Will I make good against thee arme to arme, What I haue spoken, or thou canst deuise I take it vp, and by that sword I sweare, Which gently laid my Knight-hood on my shoulder, Ile answer thee in any faire degree, Or Chiualrous designe of knightly triall: And when I mount, aliue may I not light, If I be Traitor, or vniustly fight What doth our Cosin lay to Mowbraies charge? It must be great that can inherite vs, So much as of a thought of ill in him Looke what I said, my life shall proue it true, That Mowbray hath receiu'd eight thousand Nobles, In name of lendings for your Highnesse Soldiers, The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments, Like a false Traitor, and iniurious Villaine. Besides I say, and will in battaile proue, Or heere, or elsewhere to the furthest Verge That euer was suruey'd by English eye, That all the Treasons for these eighteene yeeres Complotted, and contriued in this Land, Fetch'd from false Mowbray their first head and spring. Further I say, and further will maintaine Vpon his bad life, to make all this good. That he did plot the Duke of Glousters death, Suggest his soone beleeuing aduersaries, And consequently, like a Traitor Coward, Sluc'd out his innocent soule through streames of blood: Which blood, like sacrificing Abels cries, (Euen from the toonglesse cauernes of the earth) To me for iustice, and rough chasticement: And by the glorious worth of my discent, This arme shall do it, or this life be spent How high a pitch his resolution soares: Thomas of Norfolke, what sayest thou to this? Oh let my Soueraigne turne away his face, And bid his eares a little while be deafe, Till I haue told this slander of his blood, How God, and good men, hate so foule a lyar Mowbray, impartiall are our eyes and eares, Were he my brother, nay our kingdomes heyre, As he is but my fathers brothers sonne; Now by my Scepters awe, I make a vow, Such neighbour-neerenesse to our sacred blood, Should nothing priuiledge him, nor partialize The vn-stooping firmenesse of my vpright soule. He is our subiect (Mowbray) so art thou, Free speech, and fearelesse, I to thee allow Then Bullingbrooke, as low as to thy heart, Through the false passage of thy throat; thou lyest: Three parts of that receipt I had for Callice, Disburst I to his Highnesse souldiers; The other part reseru'd I by consent, For that my Soueraigne Liege was in my debt, Vpon remainder of a deere Accompt, Since last I went to France to fetch his Queene: Now swallow downe that Lye. For Glousters death, I slew him not; but (to mine owne disgrace) Neglected my sworne duty in that case: For you my noble Lord of Lancaster, The honourable Father to my foe, Once I did lay an ambush for your life, A trespasse that doth vex my greeued soule: But ere I last receiu'd the Sacrament, I did confesse it, and exactly begg'd Your Graces pardon, and I hope I had it. This is my fault: as for the rest appeal'd, It issues from the rancour of a Villaine, A recreant, and most degenerate Traitor, Which in my selfe I boldly will defend, And interchangeably hurle downe my gage Vpon this ouer-weening Traitors foote, To proue my selfe a loyall Gentleman, Euen in the best blood chamber'd in his bosome. In hast whereof, most heartily I pray Your Highnesse to assigne our Triall day Wrath-kindled Gentlemen be rul'd by me: Let's purge this choller without letting blood: This we prescribe, though no Physition, Deepe malice makes too deepe incision. Forget, forgiue, conclude, and be agreed, Our Doctors say, This is no time to bleed. Good Vnckle, let this end where it begun, Wee'l calme the Duke of Norfolke; you, your son To be a make-peace shall become my age, Throw downe (my sonne) the Duke of Norfolkes gage And Norfolke, throw downe his When Harrie when? Obedience bids, Obedience bids I should not bid agen Norfolke, throw downe, we bidde; there is no boote My selfe I throw (dread Soueraigne) at thy foot. My life thou shalt command, but not my shame, The one my dutie owes, but my faire name Despight of death, that liues vpon my graue To darke dishonours vse, thou shalt not haue. I am disgrac'd, impeach'd, and baffel'd heere, Pierc'd to the soule with slanders venom'd speare: The which no balme can cure, but his heart blood Which breath'd this poyson Rage must be withstood: Giue me his gage: Lyons make Leopards tame Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame, And I resigne my gage. My deere, deere Lord, The purest treasure mortall times afford Is spotlesse reputation: that away, Men are but gilded loame, or painted clay. A Iewell in a ten times barr'd vp Chest, Is a bold spirit, in a loyall brest. Mine Honor is my life; both grow in one: Take Honor from me, and my life is done. Then (deere my Liege) mine Honor let me trie, In that I liue; and for that will I die Coosin, throw downe your gage, Do you begin Oh heauen defend my soule from such foule sin. Shall I seeme Crest-falne in my fathers sight, Or with pale beggar-feare impeach my hight Before this out-dar'd dastard? Ere my toong, Shall wound mine honor with such feeble wrong; Or sound so base a parle: my teeth shall teare The slauish motiue of recanting feare, And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace, Where shame doth harbour, euen in Mowbrayes face. We were not borne to sue, but to command, Which since we cannot do to make you friends, Be readie, (as your liues shall answer it) At Couentree, vpon S. Lamberts day: There shall your swords and Lances arbitrate The swelling difference of your setled hate: Since we cannot attone you, you shall see Iustice designe the Victors Chiualrie. Lord Marshall, command our Officers at Armes, Be readie to direct these home Alarmes. Scaena Secunda. Alas, the part I had in Glousters blood, Doth more solicite me then your exclaimes, To stirre against the Butchers of his life. But since correction lyeth in those hands Which made the fault that we cannot correct, Put we our quarrell to the will of heauen, Who when they see the houres ripe on earth, Will raigne hot vengeance on offenders heads Findes brotherhood in thee no sharper spurre? Hath loue in thy old blood no liuing fire? Edwards seuen sonnes (whereof thy selfe art one) Were as seuen violles of his Sacred blood, Or seuen faire branches springing from one roote: Some of those seuen are dride by natures course, Some of those branches by the destinies cut: But Thomas, my deere Lord, my life, my Glouster, One Violl full of Edwards Sacred blood, One flourishing branch of his most Royall roote Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt; Is hackt downe, and his summer leafes all vaded By Enuies hand, and Murders bloody Axe. Ah Gaunt! His blood was thine, that bed, that wombe, That mettle, that selfe-mould that fashion'd thee, Made him a man: and though thou liu'st, and breath'st, Yet art thou slaine in him: thou dost consent In some large measure to thy Fathers death, In that thou seest thy wretched brother dye, Who was the modell of thy Fathers life. Call it not patience (Gaunt) it is dispaire, In suffring thus thy brother to be slaughter'd, Thou shew'st the naked pathway to thy life, Teaching sterne murther how to butcher thee: That which in meane men we intitle patience Is pale cold cowardice in noble brests: What shall I say, to safegard thine owne life, The best way is to venge my Glousters death Heauens is the quarrell: for heauens substitute His Deputy annointed in his sight, Hath caus'd his death, the which if wrongfully Let heauen reuenge: for I may neuer lift An angry arme against his Minister Where then (alas may I) complaint my selfe? To heauen, the widdowes Champion to defence Why then I will: farewell old Gaunt. Thou go'st to Couentrie, there to behold Our Cosine Herford, and fell Mowbray fight: O sit my husbands wrongs on Herfords speare, That it may enter butcher Mowbrayes brest: Or if misfortune misse the first carreere, Be Mowbrayes sinnes so heauy in his bosome, That they may breake his foaming Coursers backe, And throw the Rider headlong in the Lists, A Caytiffe recreant to my Cosine Herford: Farewell old Gaunt, thy sometimes brothers wife With her companion Greefe, must end her life Sister farewell: I must to Couentree, As much good stay with thee, as go with mee Yet one word more: Greefe boundeth where it falls, Not with the emptie hollownes, but weight: I take my leaue, before I haue begun, For sorrow ends not, when it seemeth done. Commend me to my brother Edmund Yorke. Loe, this is all: nay, yet depart not so, Though this be all, do not so quickly go, I shall remember more. Bid him, Oh, what? With all good speed at Plashie visit mee. Alacke, and what shall good old Yorke there see But empty lodgings, and vnfurnish'd walles, Vn-peopel'd Offices, vntroden stones? And what heare there for welcome, but my grones? Therefore commend me, let him not come there, To seeke out sorrow, that dwels euery where: Desolate, desolate will I hence, and dye, The last leaue of thee, takes my weeping eye. Scena Tertia. My L. Aumerle, is Harry Herford arm'd Yea, at all points, and longs to enter in The Duke of Norfolke, sprightfully and bold, Stayes but the summons of the Appealants Trumpet Why then the Champions, are prepar'd, and stay For nothing but his Maiesties approach. Mowbray in Armor, and Harrold. Marshall, demand of yonder Champion The cause of his arriuall heere in Armes, Aske him his name, and orderly proceed To sweare him in the iustice of his cause In Gods name, and the Kings say who y art, And why thou com'st thus knightly clad in Armes? Against what man thou com'st, and what's thy quarrell, Speake truly on thy knighthood, and thine oath, As so defend thee heauen, and thy valour My name is Tho. Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk, Who hither comes engaged by my oath (Which heauen defend a knight should violate) Both to defend my loyalty and truth, To God, my King, and his succeeding issue, Against the Duke of Herford, that appeales me: And by the grace of God, and this mine arme, To proue him (in defending of my selfe) A Traitor to my God, my King, and me, And as I truly fight, defend me heauen. Enter Hereford, and Harold. Marshall: Aske yonder Knight in Armes, Both who he is, and why he commeth hither, Thus placed in habiliments of warre: And formerly according to our Law Depose him in the iustice of his cause What is thy name? and wherfore comst y hither Before King Richard in his Royall Lists? Against whom com'st thou? and what's thy quarrell? Speake like a true Knight, so defend thee heauen Harry of Herford, Lancaster, and Derbie, Am I: who ready heere do stand in Armes, To proue by heauens grace, and my bodies valour, In Lists, on Thomas Mowbray Duke of Norfolke, That he's a Traitor foule, and dangerous, To God of heauen, King Richard, and to me, And as I truly fight, defend me heauen On paine of death, no person be so bold, Or daring hardie as to touch the Listes, Except the Marshall, and such Officers Appointed to direct these faire designes Lord Marshall, let me kisse my Soueraigns hand, And bow my knee before his Maiestie: For Mowbray and my selfe are like two men, That vow a long and weary pilgrimage, Then let vs take a ceremonious leaue And louing farwell of our seuerall friends The Appealant in all duty greets your Highnes, And craues to kisse your hand, and take his leaue We will descend, and fold him in our armes. Cosin of Herford, as thy cause is iust, So be thy fortune in this Royall fight: Farewell, my blood, which if to day thou shead, Lament we may, but not reuenge thee dead Oh let no noble eye prophane a teare For me, if I be gor'd with Mowbrayes speare: As confident, as is the Falcons flight Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight. My louing Lord, I take my leaue of you, Of you (my Noble Cosin) Lord Aumerle; Not sicke, although I haue to do with death, But lustie, yong, and cheerely drawing breath. Loe, as at English Feasts, so I regreete The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet. Oh thou the earthy author of my blood, Whose youthfull spirit in me regenerate, Doth with a two-fold rigor lift mee vp To reach at victory aboue my head, Adde proofe vnto mine Armour with thy prayres, And with thy blessings steele my Lances point, That it may enter Mowbrayes waxen Coate, And furnish new the name of Iohn a Gaunt, Euen in the lusty hauiour of his sonne Heauen in thy good cause make thee prosp'rous Be swift like lightning in the execution, And let thy blowes doubly redoubled, Fall like amazing thunder on the Caske Of thy amaz'd pernicious enemy. Rouze vp thy youthfull blood, be valiant, and liue Mine innocence, and S. George to thriue How euer heauen or fortune cast my lot, There liues, or dies, true to Kings Richards Throne, A loyall, iust, and vpright Gentleman: Neuer did Captiue with a freer heart, Cast off his chaines of bondage, and embrace His golden vncontroul'd enfranchisement, More then my dancing soule doth celebrate This Feast of Battell, with mine Aduersarie. Most mighty Liege, and my companion Peeres, Take from my mouth, the wish of happy yeares, As gentle, and as iocond, as to iest, Go I to fight: Truth, hath a quiet brest Farewell, my Lord, securely I espy Vertue with Valour, couched in thine eye: Order the triall Marshall, and begin Harrie of Herford, Lancaster, and Derby, Receiue thy Launce, and heauen defend thy right Strong as a towre in hope, I cry Amen Go beare this Lance to Thomas D. of Norfolke 1.Har. Harry of Herford, Lancaster, and Derbie, Stands heere for God, his Soueraigne, and himselfe, On paine to be found false, and recreant, To proue the Duke of Norfolke, Thomas Mowbray, A Traitor to his God, his King, and him, And dares him to set forwards to the fight 2.Har. Here standeth Tho: Mowbray Duke of Norfolk On paine to be found false and recreant, Both to defend himselfe, and to approue Henry of Herford, Lancaster, and Derby, To God, his Soueraigne, and to him disloyall: Couragiously, and with a free desire Attending but the signall to begin. A charge sounded Sound Trumpets, and set forward Combatants: Stay, the King hath throwne his Warder downe Let them lay by their Helmets & their Speares, And both returne backe to their Chaires againe: Withdraw with vs, and let the Trumpets sound, While we returne these Dukes what we decree. A long Flourish. Draw neere and list What with our Councell we haue done. For that our kingdomes earth should not be soyld With that deere blood which it hath fostered, And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect Of ciuill wounds plowgh'd vp with neighbors swords, Which so rouz'd vp with boystrous vntun'd drummes, With harsh resounding Trumpets dreadfull bray, And grating shocke of wrathfull yron Armes, Might from our quiet Confines fright faire peace, And make vs wade euen in our kindreds blood: Therefore, we banish you our Territories. You Cosin Herford, vpon paine of death, Till twice fiue Summers haue enrich'd our fields, Shall not regreet our faire dominions, But treade the stranger pathes of banishment Your will be done: This must my comfort be, That Sun that warmes you heere, shall shine on me: And those his golden beames to you heere lent, Shall point on me, and gild my banishment Norfolke: for thee remaines a heauier dombe, Which I with some vnwillingnesse pronounce, The slye slow houres shall not determinate The datelesse limit of thy deere exile: The hopelesse word, of Neuer to returne, Breath I against thee, vpon paine of life A heauy sentence, my most Soueraigne Liege, And all vnlook'd for from your Highnesse mouth: A deerer merit, not so deepe a maime, As to be cast forth in the common ayre Haue I deserued at your Highnesse hands. The Language I haue learn'd these forty yeares (My natiue English) now I must forgo, And now my tongues vse is to me no more, Then an vnstringed Vyall, or a Harpe, Or like a cunning Instrument cas'd vp, Or being open, put into his hands That knowes no touch to tune the harmony. Doubly percullist with my teeth and lippes, And dull, vnfeeling, barren ignorance, Is made my Gaoler to attend on me: I am too old to fawne vpon a Nurse, Too farre in yeeres to be a pupill now: What is thy sentence then, but speechlesse death, Which robs my tongue from breathing natiue breath? It boots thee not to be compassionate, After our sentence, plaining comes too late Then thus I turne me from my countries light To dwell in solemne shades of endlesse night Returne againe, and take an oath with thee, Lay on our Royall sword, your banisht hands; Sweare by the duty that you owe to heauen (Our part therein we banish with your selues) To keepe the Oath that we administer: You neuer shall (so helpe you Truth, and Heauen) Embrace each others loue in banishment, Nor euer looke vpon each others face, Nor euer write, regreete, or reconcile This lowring tempest of your home-bred hate, Nor euer by aduised purpose meete, To plot, contriue, or complot any ill, 'Gainst Vs, our State, our Subiects, or our Land I sweare And I, to keepe all this Norfolke, so fare, as to mine enemie, By this time (had the King permitted vs) One of our soules had wandred in the ayre, Banish'd this fraile sepulchre of our flesh, As now our flesh is banish'd from this Land. Confesse thy Treasons, ere thou flye this Realme, Since thou hast farre to go, beare not along The clogging burthen of a guilty soule No Bullingbroke: If euer I were Traitor, My name be blotted from the booke of Life, And I from heauen banish'd, as from hence: But what thou art, heauen, thou, and I do know, And all too soone (I feare) the King shall rue. Farewell (my Liege) now no way can I stray, Saue backe to England, all the worlds my way. Vncle, euen in the glasses of thine eyes I see thy greeued heart: thy sad aspect, Hath from the number of his banish'd yeares Pluck'd foure away: Six frozen Winters spent, Returne with welcome home, from banishment How long a time lyes in one little word: Foure lagging Winters, and foure wanton springs End in a word, such is the breath of Kings I thanke my Liege, that in regard of me He shortens foure yeares of my sonnes exile: But little vantage shall I reape thereby. For ere the sixe yeares that he hath to spend Can change their Moones, and bring their times about, My oyle-dride Lampe, and time-bewasted light Shall be extinct with age, and endlesse night: My inch of Taper, will be burnt, and done, And blindfold death, not let me see my sonne Why Vncle, thou hast many yeeres to liue But not a minute (King) that thou canst giue; Shorten my dayes thou canst with sudden sorow, And plucke nights from me, but not lend a morrow: Thou canst helpe time to furrow me with age, But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage: Thy word is currant with him, for my death, But dead, thy kingdome cannot buy my breath Thy sonne is banish'd vpon good aduice, Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gaue, Why at our Iustice seem'st thou then to lowre? Things sweet to tast, proue in digestion sowre: You vrg'd me as a Iudge, but I had rather You would haue bid me argue like a Father. Alas, I look'd when some of you should say, I was too strict to make mine owne away: But you gaue leaue to my vnwilling tong, Against my will, to do my selfe this wrong Cosine farewell: and Vncle bid him so: Six yeares we banish him, and he shall go. Cosine farewell: what presence must not know From where you do remaine, let paper show My Lord, no leaue take I, for I will ride As farre as land will let me, by your side Oh to what purpose dost thou hord thy words, That thou returnst no greeting to thy friends? I haue too few to take my leaue of you, When the tongues office should be prodigall, To breath th' abundant dolour of the heart Thy greefe is but thy absence for a time Ioy absent, greefe is present for that time What is sixe Winters, they are quickely gone? To men in ioy, but greefe makes one houre ten Call it a trauell that thou tak'st for pleasure My heart will sigh, when I miscall it so, Which findes it an inforced Pilgrimage The sullen passage of thy weary steppes Esteeme a soyle, wherein thou art to set The precious Iewell of thy home returne Oh who can hold a fire in his hand By thinking on the frostie Caucasus? Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite, By bare imagination of a Feast? Or Wallow naked in December snow By thinking on fantasticke summers heate? Oh no, the apprehension of the good Giues but the greater feeling to the worse: Fell sorrowes tooth, doth euer ranckle more Then when it bites, but lanceth not the sore Come, come (my son) Ile bring thee on thy way Had I thy youth, and cause, I would not stay Then Englands ground farewell: sweet soil adieu, My Mother, and my Nurse, which beares me yet: Where ere I wander, boast of this I can, Though banish'd, yet a true-borne Englishman. Scoena Quarta. We did obserue. Cosine Aumerle, How far brought you high Herford on his way? I brought high Herford (if you call him so) But to the next high way, and there I left him And say, what store of parting tears were shed? Faith none for me: except the Northeast wind Which then grew bitterly against our face, Awak'd the sleepie rhewme, and so by chance Did grace our hollow parting with a teare What said our Cosin when you parted with him? Farewell: and for my hart disdained y my tongue Should so prophane the word, that taught me craft To counterfeit oppression of such greefe, That word seem'd buried in my sorrowes graue. Marry, would the word Farwell, haue lengthen'd houres, And added yeeres to his short banishment, He should haue had a volume of Farwels, But since it would not, he had none of me He is our Cosin (Cosin) but 'tis doubt, When time shall call him home from banishment, Whether our kinsman come to see his friends, Our selfe, and Bushy: heere Bagot and Greene Obseru'd his Courtship to the common people: How he did seeme to diue into their hearts, With humble, and familiar courtesie, What reuerence he did throw away on slaues; Wooing poore Craftes-men, with the craft of soules, And patient vnder-bearing of his Fortune, As 'twere to banish their affects with him. Off goes his bonnet to an Oyster-wench, A brace of Dray-men bid God speed him well, And had the tribute of his supple knee, With thankes my Countrimen, my louing friends, As were our England in reuersion his, And he our subiects next degree in hope Well, he is gone, & with him go these thoughts: Now for the Rebels, which stand out in Ireland, Expedient manage must be made my Liege Ere further leysure, yeeld them further meanes For their aduantage, and your Highnesse losse We will our selfe in person to this warre, And for our Coffers, with too great a Court, And liberall Largesse, are growne somewhat light, We are inforc'd to farme our royall Realme, The Reuennew whereof shall furnish vs For our affayres in hand: if that come short Our Substitutes at home shall haue Blanke-charters: Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich, They shall subscribe them for large summes of Gold, And send them after to supply our wants: For we will make for Ireland presently. Bushy, what newes? Old Iohn of Gaunt is verie sicke my Lord, Sodainly taken, and hath sent post haste To entreat your Maiesty to visit him Where lyes he? At Ely house Now put it (heauen) in his Physitians minde, To helpe him to his graue immediately: The lining of his coffers shall make Coates To decke our souldiers for these Irish warres. Come Gentlemen, let's all go visit him: Pray heauen we may make hast, and come too late. Will the King come, that I may breath my last In wholsome counsell to his vnstaid youth? Vex not your selfe, nor striue not with your breth, For all in vaine comes counsell to his eare Oh but (they say) the tongues of dying men Inforce attention like deepe harmony; Where words are scarse, they are seldome spent in vaine, For they breath truth, that breath their words in paine. He that no more must say, is listen'd more, Then they whom youth and ease haue taught to glose, More are mens ends markt, then their liues before, The setting Sun, and Musicke in the close As the last taste of sweetes, is sweetest last, Writ in remembrance, more then things long past; Though Richard my liues counsell would not heare, My deaths sad tale, may yet vndeafe his eare No, it is stopt with other flatt'ring sounds As praises of his state: then there are found Lasciuious Meeters, to whose venom sound The open eare of youth doth alwayes listen. Report of fashions in proud Italy, Whose manners still our tardie apish Nation Limpes after in base imitation. Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity, So it be new, there's no respect how vile, That is not quickly buz'd into his eares? That all too late comes counsell to be heard, Where will doth mutiny with wits regard: Direct not him, whose way himselfe will choose, Tis breath thou lackst, and that breath wilt thou loose Me thinkes I am a Prophet new inspir'd, And thus expiring, do foretell of him, His rash fierce blaze of Ryot cannot last, For violent fires soone burne out themselues, Small showres last long, but sodaine stormes are short, He tyres betimes, that spurs too fast betimes; With eager feeding, food doth choake the feeder: Light vanity, insatiate cormorant, Consuming meanes soone preyes vpon it selfe. This royall Throne of Kings, this sceptred Isle, This earth of Maiesty, this seate of Mars, This other Eden, demy paradise, This Fortresse built by Nature for her selfe, Against infection, and the hand of warre: This happy breed of men, this little world, This precious stone, set in the siluer sea, Which serues it in the office of a wall, Or as a Moate defensiue to a house, Against the enuy of lesse happier Lands, This blessed plot, this earth, this Realme, this England, This Nurse, this teeming wombe of Royall Kings, Fear'd by their breed, and famous for their birth, Renowned for their deeds, as farre from home, For Christian seruice, and true Chiualrie, As is the sepulcher in stubborne Iury Of the Worlds ransome, blessed Maries Sonne. This Land of such deere soules, this deere-deere Land, Deere for her reputation through the world, Is now Leas'd out (I dye pronouncing it) Like to a Tenement or pelting Farme. England bound in with the triumphant sea, Whose rocky shore beates backe the enuious siedge Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame, With Inky blottes, and rotten Parchment bonds. That England, that was wont to conquer others, Hath made a shamefull conquest of it selfe. Ah! would the scandall vanish with my life, How happy then were my ensuing death? The King is come, deale mildly with his youth, For young hot Colts, being rag'd, do rage the more How fares our noble Vncle Lancaster? What comfort man? How ist with aged Gaunt? Oh how that name befits my composition: Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old: And who abstaynes from meate, that is not gaunt? For sleeping England long time haue I watcht, Watching breeds leannesse, leannesse is all gaunt. The pleasure that some Fathers feede vpon, Is my strict fast, I meane my Childrens lookes, And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt: Gaunt am I for the graue, gaunt as a graue, Whose hollow wombe inherits naught but bones Can sicke men play so nicely with their names? No, misery makes sport to mocke it selfe: Since thou dost seeke to kill my name in mee, I mocke my name (great King) to flatter thee Should dying men flatter those that liue? No, no, men liuing flatter those that dye Thou now a dying, sayst thou flatter'st me Oh no, thou dyest, though I the sicker be I am in health, I breath, I see thee ill Now he that made me, knowes I see thee ill: Ill in my selfe to see, and in thee, seeing ill, Thy death-bed is no lesser then the Land, Wherein thou lyest in reputation sicke, And thou too care-lesse patient as thou art, Commit'st thy 'anointed body to the cure Of those Physitians, that first wounded thee. A thousand flatterers sit within thy Crowne, Whose compasse is no bigger then thy head, And yet incaged in so small a Verge, The waste is no whit lesser then thy Land: Oh had thy Grandsire with a Prophets eye, Seene how his sonnes sonne, should destroy his sonnes, From forth thy reach he would haue laid thy shame, Deposing thee before thou wert possest, Which art possest now to depose thy selfe. Why (Cosine) were thou Regent of the world, It were a shame to let his Land by lease: But for thy world enioying but this Land, Is it not more then shame, to shame it so? Landlord of England art thou, and not King: Thy state of Law, is bondslaue to the law, And- And thou, a lunaticke leane-witted foole, Presuming on an Agues priuiledge, Dar'st with thy frozen admonition Make pale our cheeke, chasing the Royall blood With fury, from his natiue residence? Now by my Seates right Royall Maiestie, Wer't thou not Brother to great Edwards sonne, This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head, Should run thy head from thy vnreuerent shoulders Oh spare me not, my brothers Edwards sonne, For that I was his Father Edwards sonne: That blood already (like the Pellican) Thou hast tapt out, and drunkenly carows'd. My brother Gloucester, plaine well meaning soule (Whom faire befall in heauen 'mongst happy soules) May be a president, and witnesse good, That thou respect'st not spilling Edwards blood: Ioyne with the present sicknesse that I haue, And thy vnkindnesse be like crooked age, To crop at once a too-long wither'd flowre. Liue in thy shame, but dye not shame with thee, These words heereafter, thy tormentors bee. Conuey me to my bed, then to my graue, Loue they to liue, that loue and honor haue. And let them dye, that age and sullens haue, For both hast thou, and both become the graue I do beseech your Maiestie impute his words To wayward sicklinesse, and age in him: He loues you on my life, and holds you deere As Harry Duke of Herford, were he heere Right, you say true: as Herfords loue, so his; As theirs, so mine: and all be as it is. My Liege, olde Gaunt commends him to your Maiestie What sayes he? Nay nothing, all is said: His tongue is now a stringlesse instrument, Words, life, and all, old Lancaster hath spent Be Yorke the next, that must be bankrupt so, Though death be poore, it ends a mortall wo The ripest fruit first fals, and so doth he, His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be: So much for that. Now for our Irish warres, We must supplant those rough rug-headed Kernes, Which liue like venom, where no venom else But onely they, haue priuiledge to liue. And for these great affayres do aske some charge Towards our assistance, we do seize to vs The plate, coine, reuennewes, and moueables, Whereof our Vncle Gaunt did stand possest How long shall I be patient? Oh how long Shall tender dutie make me suffer wrong? Not Glousters death, nor Herfords banishment, Nor Gauntes rebukes, nor Englands priuate wrongs, Nor the preuention of poore Bullingbrooke, About his marriage, nor my owne disgrace Haue euer made me sowre my patient cheeke, Or bend one wrinckle on my Soueraignes face: I am the last of noble Edwards sonnes, Of whom thy Father Prince of Wales was first, In warre was neuer Lyon rag'd more fierce: In peace, was neuer gentle Lambe more milde, Then was that yong and Princely Gentleman, His face thou hast, for euen so look'd he Accomplish'd with the number of thy howers: But when he frown'd, it was against the French, And not against his friends: his noble hand Did win what he did spend: and spent not that Which his triumphant fathers hand had won: His hands were guilty of no kindreds blood, But bloody with the enemies of his kinne: Oh Richard, Yorke is too farre gone with greefe, Or else he neuer would compare betweene Why Vncle, What's the matter? Oh my Liege, pardon me if you please, if not I pleas'd not to be pardon'd, am content with all: Seeke you to seize, and gripe into your hands The Royalties and Rights of banish'd Herford? Is not Gaunt dead? and doth not Herford liue? Was not Gaunt iust? and is not Harry true? Did not the one deserue to haue an heyre? Is not his heyre a well-deseruing sonne? Take Herfords rights away, and take from time His Charters, and his customarie rights: Let not to morrow then insue to day, Be not thy selfe. For how art thou a King But by faire sequence and succession? Now afore God, God forbid I say true, If you do wrongfully seize Herfords right, Call in his Letters Patents that he hath By his Atturneyes generall, to sue His Liuerie, and denie his offer'd homage, You plucke a thousand dangers on your head, You loose a thousand well-disposed hearts, And pricke my tender patience to those thoughts Which honor and allegeance cannot thinke Thinke what you will: we seise into our hands, His plate, his goods, his money, and his lands Ile not be by the while: My Liege farewell, What will ensue heereof, there's none can tell. But by bad courses may be vnderstood, That their euents can neuer fall out good. Go Bushie to the Earle of Wiltshire streight, Bid him repaire to vs to Ely house, To see this businesse: to morrow next We will for Ireland, and 'tis time, I trow: And we create in absence of our selfe Our Vncle Yorke, Lord Gouernor of England: For he is iust, and alwayes lou'd vs well. Come on our Queene, to morrow must we part, Be merry, for our time of stay is short. Manet North. Willoughby, & Ross. Well Lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead And liuing too, for now his sonne is Duke Barely in title, not in reuennew Richly in both, if iustice had her right My heart is great: but it must break with silence, Er't be disburthen'd with a liberall tongue Nay speake thy mind: & let him ne'r speak more That speakes thy words againe to do thee harme Tends that thou'dst speake to th' Du. of Hereford, If it be so, out with it boldly man, Quicke is mine eare to heare of good towards him No good at all that I can do for him, Vnlesse you call it good to pitie him, Bereft and gelded of his patrimonie Now afore heauen, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne. In him a royall Prince, and many moe Of noble blood in this declining Land; The King is not himselfe, but basely led By Flatterers, and what they will informe Meerely in hate 'gainst any of vs all, That will the King seuerely prosecute 'Gainst vs, our liues, our children, and our heires The Commons hath he pil'd with greeuous taxes And quite lost their hearts: the Nobles hath he finde For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts And daily new exactions are deuis'd, As blankes, beneuolences, and I wot not what: But what o' Gods name doth become of this? Wars hath not wasted it, for war'd he hath not. But basely yeelded vpon comprimize, That which his Ancestors atchieu'd with blowes: More hath he spent in peace, then they in warres The Earle of Wiltshire hath the realme in Farme The Kings growne bankrupt like a broken man Reproach, and dissolution hangeth ouer him He hath not monie for these Irish warres: (His burthenous taxations notwithstanding) But by the robbing of the banish'd Duke His noble Kinsman, most degenerate King: But Lords, we heare this fearefull tempest sing, Yet seeke no shelter to auoid the storme: We see the winde sit sore vpon our sailes, And yet we strike not, but securely perish We see the very wracke that we must suffer, And vnauoyded is the danger now For suffering so the causes of our wracke Not so: euen through the hollow eyes of death, I spie life peering: but I dare not say How neere the tidings of our comfort is Nay let vs share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours Be confident to speake Northumberland, We three, are but thy selfe, and speaking so, Thy words are but as thoughts, therefore be bold Then thus: I haue from Port le Blan A Bay in Britaine, receiu'd intelligence, That Harry Duke of Herford, Rainald Lord Cobham, That late broke from the Duke of Exeter, His brother Archbishop, late of Canterbury, Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir Iohn Rainston, Sir Iohn Norberie, & Sir Robert Waterton, & Francis Quoint, All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Britaine, With eight tall ships, three thousand men of warre Are making hither with all due expedience, And shortly meane to touch our Northerne shore: Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay The first departing of the King for Ireland. If then we shall shake off our slauish yoake, Impe out our drooping Countries broken wing, Redeeme from broaking pawne the blemish'd Crowne, Wipe off the dust that hides our Scepters gilt, And make high Maiestie looke like it selfe, Away with me in poste to Rauenspurgh, But if you faint, as fearing to do so, Stay, and be secret, and my selfe will go To horse, to horse, vrge doubts to them y feare Hold out my horse, and I will first be there. Scena Secunda. Madam, your Maiesty is too much sad, You promis'd when you parted with the King, To lay aside selfe-harming heauinesse, And entertaine a cheerefull disposition To please the King, I did: to please my selfe I cannot do it: yet I know no cause Why I should welcome such a guest as greefe, Saue bidding farewell to so sweet a guest As my sweet Richard; yet againe me thinkes, Some vnborne sorrow, ripe in fortunes wombe Is comming towards me, and my inward soule With nothing trembles, at something it greeues, More then with parting from my Lord the King Each substance of a greefe hath twenty shadows Which shewes like greefe it selfe, but is not so: For sorrowes eye, glazed with blinding teares, Diuides one thing intire, to many obiects, Like perspectiues, which rightly gaz'd vpon Shew nothing but confusion, ey'd awry, Distinguish forme: so your sweet Maiestie Looking awry vpon your Lords departure, Finde shapes of greefe, more then himselfe to waile, Which look'd on as it is, is naught but shadowes Of what it is not: then thrice-gracious Queene, More then your Lords departure weep not, more's not seene; Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrowes eie, Which for things true, weepe things imaginary It may be so: but yet my inward soule Perswades me it is otherwise: how ere it be, I cannot but be sad: so heauy sad, As though on thinking on no thought I thinke, Makes me with heauy nothing faint and shrinke 'Tis nothing but conceit (my gracious Lady.) 'Tis nothing lesse: conceit is still deriu'd From some fore-father greefe, mine is not so, For nothing hath begot my something greefe, Or something, hath the nothing that I greeue, 'Tis in reuersion that I do possesse, But what it is, that is not yet knowne, what I cannot name, 'tis namelesse woe I wot. Heauen saue your Maiesty, and wel met Gentlemen: I hope the King is not yet shipt for Ireland Why hop'st thou so? Tis better hope he is: For his designes craue hast, his hast good hope, Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipt? That he our hope, might haue retyr'd his power, and driuen into dispaire an enemies hope, Who strongly hath set footing in this Land. The banish'd Bullingbrooke repeales himselfe, And with vp-lifted Armes is safe arriu'd At Rauenspurg Now God in heauen forbid O Madam 'tis too true: and that is worse, The L. Northumberland, his yong sonne Henrie Percie, The Lords of Rosse, Beaumond, and Willoughby, With all their powrefull friends are fled to him Why haue you not proclaim'd Northumberland And the rest of the reuolted faction, Traitors? We haue: whereupon the Earle of Worcester Hath broke his staffe, resign'd his Stewardship, And al the houshold seruants fled with him to Bullinbrook So Greene, thou art the midwife of my woe, And Bullinbrooke my sorrowes dismall heyre: Now hath my soule brought forth her prodegie, And I a gasping new deliuered mother, Haue woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow ioyn'd Dispaire not Madam Who shall hinder me? I will dispaire, and be at enmitie With couzening hope; he is a Flatterer, A Parasite, a keeper backe of death, Who gently would dissolue the bands of life, Which false hopes linger in extremity. Heere comes the Duke of Yorke With signes of warre about his aged necke, Oh full of carefull businesse are his lookes: Vncle, for heauens sake speake comfortable words: Comfort's in heauen, and we are on the earth, Where nothing liues but crosses, care and greefe: Your husband he is gone to saue farre off, Whilst others come to make him loose at home: Heere am I left to vnder-prop his Land, Who weake with age, cannot support my selfe: Now comes the sicke houre that his surfet made, Now shall he try his friends that flattered him. My Lord, your sonne was gone before I came He was: why so: go all which way it will: The Nobles they are fled, the Commons they are cold, And will I feare reuolt on Herfords side. Sirra, get thee to Plashie to my sister Gloster, Bid her send me presently a thousand pound, Hold, take my Ring My Lord, I had forgot To tell your Lordship, to day I came by, and call'd there, But I shall greeue you to report the rest What is't knaue? An houre before I came, the Dutchesse di'de Heau'n for his mercy, what a tide of woes Come rushing on this wofull Land at once? I know not what to do: I would to heauen (So my vntruth had not prouok'd him to it) The King had cut off my head with my brothers. What, are there postes dispatcht for Ireland? How shall we do for money for these warres? Come sister (Cozen I would say) pray pardon me. Go fellow, get thee home, prouide some Carts, And bring away the Armour that is there. Gentlemen, will you muster men? If I know how, or which way to order these affaires Thus disorderly thrust into my hands, Neuer beleeue me. Both are my kinsmen, Th' one is my Soueraigne, whom both my oath And dutie bids defend: th' other againe Is my kinsman, whom the King hath wrong'd, Whom conscience, and my kindred bids to right: Well, somewhat we must do: Come Cozen, Ile dispose of you. Gentlemen, go muster vp your men, And meet me presently at Barkley Castle: I should to Plashy too: but time will not permit, All is vneuen, and euery thing is left at six and seuen. The winde sits faire for newes to go to Ireland, But none returnes: For vs to leuy power Proportionable to th' enemy, is all impossible Besides our neerenesse to the King in loue, Is neere the hate of those loue not the King And that's the wauering Commons, for their loue Lies in their purses, and who so empties them, By so much fils their hearts with deadly hate Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd If iudgement lye in them, then so do we, Because we haue beene euer neere the King Well: I will for refuge straight to Bristoll Castle, The Earle of Wiltshire is alreadie there Thither will I with you, for little office Will the hatefull Commons performe for vs, Except like Curres, to teare vs all in peeces: Will you go along with vs? No, I will to Ireland to his Maiestie: Farewell, if hearts presages be not vaine, We three here part, that neu'r shall meete againe That's as Yorke thriues to beate back Bullinbroke Alas poore Duke, the taske he vndertakes Is numbring sands, and drinking Oceans drie, Where one on his side fights, thousands will flye Farewell at once, for once, for all, and euer. Well, we may meete againe I feare me neuer. Scaena Tertia. How farre is it my Lord to Berkley now? Beleeue me noble Lord, I am a stranger heere in Gloustershire, These high wilde hilles, and rough vneeuen waies, Drawes out our miles, and makes them wearisome. And yet our faire discourse hath beene as sugar, Making the hard way sweet and delectable: But I bethinke me, what a wearie way From Rauenspurgh to Cottshold will be found, In Rosse and Willoughby, wanting your companie, Which I protest hath very much beguild The tediousnesse, and processe of my trauell: But theirs is sweetned with the hope to haue The present benefit that I possesse; And hope to ioy, is little lesse in ioy, Then hope enioy'd: By this, the wearie Lords Shall make their way seeme short, as mine hath done, By sight of what I haue, your Noble Companie Of much lesse value is my Companie, Then your good words: but who comes here? It is my Sonne, young Harry Percie, Sent from my Brother Worcester: Whence soeuer. Harry, how fares your Vnckle? I had thought, my Lord, to haue learn'd his health of you Why, is he not with the Queene? No, my good Lord, he hath forsook the Court, Broken his Staffe of Office, and disperst The Household of the King What was his reason? He was not so resolu'd, when we last spake together Because your Lordship was proclaimed Traitor. But hee, my Lord, is gone to Rauenspurgh, To offer seruice to the Duke of Hereford, And sent me ouer by Barkely, to discouer What power the Duke of Yorke had leuied there, Then with direction to repaire to Rauenspurgh Haue you forgot the Duke of Hereford (Boy.) No, my good Lord; for that is not forgot Which ne're I did remember: to my knowledge, I neuer in my life did looke on him Then learne to know him now: this is the Duke My gracious Lord, I tender you my seruice, Such as it is, being tender, raw, and young, Which elder dayes shall ripen, and confirme To more approued seruice, and desert I thanke thee gentle Percie, and be sure I count my selfe in nothing else so happy, As in a Soule remembring my good Friends: And as my Fortune ripens with thy Loue, It shall be still thy true Loues recompence, My Heart this Couenant makes, my Hand thus seales it How farre is it to Barkely? and what stirre Keepes good old Yorke there, with his Men of Warre? There stands the Castle, by yond tuft of Trees, Mann'd with three hundred men, as I haue heard, And in it are the Lords of Yorke, Barkely, and Seymor, None else of Name, and noble estimate. Here come the Lords of Rosse and Willoughby, Bloody with spurring, fierie red with haste Welcome my Lords, I wot your loue pursues A banisht Traytor; all my Treasurie Is yet but vnfelt thankes, which more enrich'd, Shall be your loue, and labours recompence Your presence makes vs rich, most Noble Lord And farre surmounts our labour to attaine it Euermore thankes, th' Exchequer of the poore, Which till my infant-fortune comes to yeeres, Stands for my Bountie: but who comes here? It is my Lord of Barkely, as I ghesse My Lord of Hereford, my Message is to you My Lord, my Answere is to Lancaster, And I am come to seeke that Name in England, And I must finde that Title in your Tongue, Before I make reply to aught you say Mistake me not, my Lord, 'tis not my meaning To raze one Title of your Honor out. To you, my Lord, I come (what Lord you will) From the most glorious of this Land, The Duke of Yorke, to know what pricks you on To take aduantage of the absent time, And fright our Natiue Peace with selfe-borne Armes. I shall not need transport my words by you, Here comes his Grace in Person. My Noble Vnckle Shew me thy humble heart, and not thy knee, Whose dutie is deceiuable, and false My gracious Vnckle Tut, tut, Grace me no Grace, nor Vnckle me, I am no Traytors Vnckle; and that word Grace, In an vngracious mouth, is but prophane. Why haue these banish'd, and forbidden Legges, Dar'd once to touch a Dust of Englands Ground? But more then why, why haue they dar'd to march So many miles vpon her peacefull Bosome, Frighting her pale-fac'd Villages with Warre, And ostentation of despised Armes? Com'st thou because th' anoynted King is hence? Why foolish Boy, the King is left behind, And in my loyall Bosome lyes his power. Were I but now the Lord of such hot youth, As when braue Gaunt, thy Father, and my selfe Rescued the Black Prince, that yong Mars of men, From forth the Rankes of many thousand French: Oh then, how quickly should this Arme of mine, Now Prisoner to the Palsie, chastise thee, And minister correction to thy Fault My gracious Vnckle, let me know my Fault, On what Condition stands it, and wherein? Euen in Condition of the worst degree, In grosse Rebellion, and detested Treason: Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come Before th' expiration of thy time, In brauing Armes against thy Soueraigne As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford, But as I come, I come for Lancaster. And Noble Vnckle, I beseech your Grace Looke on my Wrongs with an indifferent eye: You are my Father, for me thinkes in you I see old Gaunt aliue. Oh then my Father, Will you permit, that I shall stand condemn'd A wandring Vagabond; my Rights and Royalties Pluckt from my armes perforce, and giuen away To vpstart Vnthrifts? Wherefore was I borne? If that my Cousin King, be King of England, It must be graunted, I am Duke of Lancaster. You haue a Sonne, Aumerle, my Noble Kinsman, Had you first died, and he beene thus trod downe, He should haue found his Vnckle Gaunt a Father, To rowze his Wrongs, and chase them to the bay. I am denyde to sue my Liuerie here, And yet my Letters Patents giue me leaue: My Fathers goods are all distraynd, and sold, And these, and all, are all amisse imployd. What would you haue me doe? I am a Subiect, And challenge Law: Attorneyes are deny'd me; And therefore personally I lay my claime To my Inheritance of free Discent The Noble Duke hath been too much abus'd It stands your Grace vpon, to doe him right Base men by his endowments are made great My Lords of England, let me tell you this, I haue had feeling of my Cosens Wrongs, And labour'd all I could to doe him right: But in this kind, to come in brauing Armes, Be his owne Caruer, and cut out his way, To find out Right with Wrongs, it may not be; And you that doe abett him in this kind, Cherish Rebellion, and are Rebels all The Noble Duke hath sworne his comming is But for his owne; and for the right of that, Wee all haue strongly sworne to giue him ayd, And let him neu'r see Ioy, that breakes that Oath Well, well, I see the issue of these Armes, I cannot mend it, I must needes confesse, Because my power is weake, and all ill left: But if I could, by him that gaue me life, I would attach you all, and make you stoope Vnto the Soueraigne Mercy of the King. But since I cannot, be it knowne to you, I doe remaine as Neuter. So fare you well, Vnlesse you please to enter in the Castle, And there repose you for this Night An offer Vnckle, that wee will accept: But wee must winne your Grace to goe with vs To Bristow Castle, which they say is held By Bushie, Bagot, and their Complices, The Caterpillers of the Commonwealth, Which I haue sworne to weed, and plucke away It may be I will go with you: but yet Ile pawse, For I am loth to breake our Countries Lawes: Nor Friends, nor Foes, to me welcome you are, Things past redresse, are now with me past care. Scoena Quarta. My Lord of Salisbury, we haue stayd ten dayes, And hardly kept our Countreymen together, And yet we heare no tidings from the King; Therefore we will disperse our selues: farewell Stay yet another day, thou trustie Welchman, The King reposeth all his confidence in thee 'Tis thought the King is dead, we will not stay; The Bay-trees in our Countrey all are wither'd, And Meteors fright the fixed Starres of Heauen; The pale-fac'd Moone lookes bloody on the Earth, And leane-look'd Prophets whisper fearefull change; Rich men looke sad, and Ruffians dance and leape, The one in feare, to loose what they enioy, The other to enioy by Rage, and Warre: These signes fore-run the death of Kings. Farewell, our Countreymen are gone and fled, As well assur'd Richard their King is dead. Ah Richard, with eyes of heauie mind, I see thy Glory, like a shooting Starre, Fall to the base Earth, from the Firmament: Thy Sunne sets weeping in the lowly West, Witnessing Stormes to come, Woe, and Vnrest: Thy Friends are fled, to wait vpon thy Foes, And crossely to thy good, all fortune goes. Willoughby, with Bushie and Greene Prisoners. Bring forth these men: Bushie and Greene, I will not vex your soules, (Since presently your soules must part your bodies) With too much vrging your pernitious liues, For 'twere no Charitie: yet to wash your blood From off my hands, here in the view of men, I will vnfold some causes of your deaths. You haue mis-led a Prince, a Royall King, A happie Gentleman in Blood, and Lineaments, By you vnhappied, and disfigur'd cleane: You haue in manner with your sinfull houres Made a Diuorce betwixt his Queene and him, Broke the possession of a Royall Bed, And stayn'd the beautie of a faire Queenes Cheekes, With teares drawn fro her eyes, with your foule wrongs. My selfe a Prince, by fortune of my birth, Neere to the King in blood, and neere in loue, Till you did make him mis-interprete me, Haue stoopt my neck vnder your iniuries, And sigh'd my English breath in forraine Clouds, Eating the bitter bread of banishment; While you haue fed vpon my Seignories, Dis-park'd my Parkes, and fell'd my Forrest Woods; From mine owne Windowes torne my Household Coat, Raz'd out my Impresse, leauing me no signe, Saue mens opinions, and my liuing blood, To shew the World I am a Gentleman. This, and much more, much more then twice all this, Condemnes you to the death: see them deliuered ouer To execution, and the hand of death More welcome is the stroake of death to me, Then Bullingbrooke to England My comfort is, that Heauen will take our soules, And plague Iniustice with the paines of Hell My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd: Vnckle, you say the Queene is at your House, For Heauens sake fairely let her be entreated, Tell her I send to her my kind commends; Take speciall care my Greetings be deliuer'd A Gentleman of mine I haue dispatch'd With Letters of your loue, to her at large Thankes gentle Vnckle: come Lords away, To fight with Glendoure, and his Complices; A while to worke, and after holliday. Scena Secunda. Drums: Flourish, and Colours. Enter Richard, Aumerle, Carlile, and Barkloughly Castle call you this at hand? Yea, my Lord: how brooks your Grace the ayre, After your late tossing on the breaking Seas? Needs must I like it well: I weepe for ioy To stand vpon my Kingdome once againe. Deere Earth, I doe salute thee with my hand, Though Rebels wound thee with their Horses hoofes: As a long parted Mother with her Child, Playes fondly with her teares, and smiles in meeting; So weeping, smiling, greet I thee my Earth, And doe thee fauor with my Royall hands. Feed not thy Soueraignes Foe, my gentle Earth, Nor with thy Sweetes, comfort his rauenous sence: But let thy Spiders, that suck vp thy Venome, And heauie-gated Toades lye in their way, Doing annoyance to the trecherous feete, Which with vsurping steps doe trample thee. Yeeld stinging Nettles to mine Enemies; And when they from thy Bosome pluck a Flower, Guard it I prethee with a lurking Adder, Whose double tongue may with a mortall touch Throw death vpon thy Soueraignes Enemies. Mock not my sencelesse Coniuration, Lords; This Earth shall haue a feeling, and these Stones Proue armed Souldiers, ere her Natiue King Shall falter vnder foule Rebellious Armes Feare not my Lord, that Power that made you King Hath power to keepe you King, in spight of all He meanes, my Lord, that we are too remisse, Whilest Bullingbrooke through our securitie, Growes strong and great, in substance and in friends Discomfortable Cousin, knowest thou not, That when the searching Eye of Heauen is hid Behind the Globe, that lights the lower World, Then Theeues and Robbers raunge abroad vnseene, In Murthers and in Out-rage bloody here: But when from vnder this Terrestriall Ball He fires the prowd tops of the Easterne Pines, And darts his Lightning through eu'ry guiltie hole, Then Murthers, Treasons, and detested sinnes (The Cloake of Night being pluckt from off their backs) Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselues. So when this Theefe, this Traytor Bullingbrooke, Who all this while hath reuell'd in the Night, Shall see vs rising in our Throne, the East, His Treasons will sit blushing in his face, Not able to endure the sight of Day; But selfe-affrighted, tremble at his sinne. Not all the Water in the rough rude Sea Can wash the Balme from an anoynted King; The breath of worldly men cannot depose The Deputie elected by the Lord: For euery man that Bullingbrooke hath prest, To lift shrewd Steele against our Golden Crowne, Heauen for his Richard hath in heauenly pay A glorious Angell: then if Angels fight, Weake men must fall, for Heauen still guards the right. Welcome my Lord, how farre off lyes your Power? Nor neere, nor farther off, my gracious Lord, Then this weake arme; discomfort guides my tongue, And bids me speake of nothing but despaire: One day too late, I feare (my Noble Lord) Hath clouded all thy happie dayes on Earth: Oh call backe Yesterday, bid Time returne, And thou shalt haue twelue thousand fighting men: To day, to day, vnhappie day too late Orethrowes thy Ioyes, Friends, Fortune, and thy State; For all the Welchmen hearing thou wert dead, Are gone to Bullingbrooke, disperst, and fled Comfort my Liege, why lookes your Grace so pale? But now the blood of twentie thousand men Did triumph in my face, and they are fled, And till so much blood thither come againe, Haue I not reason to looke pale, and dead? All Soules that will be safe, flye from my side, For Time hath set a blot vpon my pride Comfort my Liege, remember who you are I had forgot my selfe. Am I not King? Awake thou sluggard Maiestie, thou sleepest: Is not the Kings Name fortie thousand Names? Arme, arme my Name: a punie subiect strikes At thy great glory. Looke not to the ground, Ye Fauorites of a King: are wee not high? High be our thoughts: I know my Vnckle Yorke Hath Power enough to serue our turne. But who comes here? More health and happinesse betide my Liege, Then can my care-tun'd tongue deliuer him Mine eare is open, and my heart prepar'd: The worst is worldly losse, thou canst vnfold: Say, Is my Kingdome lost? why 'twas my Care: And what losse is it to be rid of Care? Striues Bullingbrooke to be as Great as wee? Greater he shall not be: If hee serue God, Wee'l serue him too, and be his Fellow so. Reuolt our Subiects? That we cannot mend, They breake their Faith to God, as well as vs: Cry Woe, Destruction, Ruine, Losse, Decay, The worst is Death, and Death will haue his day Glad am I, that your Highnesse is so arm'd To beare the tidings of Calamitie. Like an vnseasonable stormie day, Which make the Siluer Riuers drowne their Shores, As if the World were all dissolu'd to teares: So high, aboue his Limits, swells the Rage Of Bullingbrooke, couering your fearefull Land With hard bright Steele, and hearts harder then Steele: White Beares haue arm'd their thin and hairelesse Scalps Against thy Maiestie, and Boyes with Womens Voyces, Striue to speake bigge, and clap their female ioints In stiffe vnwieldie Armes: against thy Crowne Thy very Beads-men learne to bend their Bowes Of double fatall Eugh: against thy State Yea Distaffe-Women manage rustie Bills: Against thy Seat both young and old rebell, And all goes worse then I haue power to tell Too well, too well thou tell'st a Tale so ill. Where is the Earle of Wiltshire? where is Bagot? What is become of Bushie? where is Greene? That they haue let the dangerous Enemie Measure our Confines with such peacefull steps? If we preuaile, their heads shall pay for it. I warrant they haue made peace with Bullingbrooke Peace haue they made with him indeede (my ) Oh Villains, Vipers, damn'd without redemption, Dogges, easily woon to fawne on any man, Snakes in my heart blood warm'd, that sting my heart, Three Iudasses, each one thrice worse then Iudas, Would they make peace? terrible Hell make warre Vpon their spotted Soules for this Offence Sweet Loue (I see) changing his propertie, Turnes to the sowrest, and most deadly hate: Againe vncurse their Soules; their peace is made With Heads, and not with Hands: those whom you curse Haue felt the worst of Deaths destroying hand, And lye full low, grau'd in the hollow ground Is Bushie, Greene, and the Earle of Wiltshire dead? Yea, all of them at Bristow lost their heads Where is the Duke my Father with his Power? No matter where; of comfort no man speake: Let's talke of Graues, of Wormes, and Epitaphs, Make Dust our Paper, and with Raynie eyes Write Sorrow on the Bosome of the Earth. Let's chuse Executors, and talke of Wills: And yet not so; for what can we bequeath, Saue our deposed bodies to the ground? Our Lands, our Liues, and all are Bullingbrookes, And nothing can we call our owne, but Death, And that small Modell of the barren Earth, Which serues as Paste, and Couer to our Bones: For Heauens sake let vs sit vpon the ground, And tell sad stories of the death of Kings: How some haue been depos'd, some slaine in warre, Some haunted by the Ghosts they haue depos'd, Some poyson'd by their Wiues, some sleeping kill'd, All murther'd. For within the hollow Crowne That rounds the mortall Temples of a King, Keepes Death his Court, and there the Antique sits Scoffing his State, and grinning at his Pompe, Allowing him a breath, a little Scene, To Monarchize, be fear'd, and kill with lookes, Infusing him with selfe and vaine conceit, As if this Flesh, which walls about our Life, Were Brasse impregnable: and humor'd thus, Comes at the last, and with a little Pinne Bores through his Castle Walls, and farwell King. Couer your heads, and mock not flesh and blood With solemne Reuerence: throw away Respect, Tradition, Forme, and Ceremonious dutie, For you haue but mistooke me all this while: I liue with Bread like you, feele Want, Taste Griefe, need Friends: subiected thus, How can you say to me, I am a King? My Lord, wise men ne're waile their present woes, But presently preuent the wayes to waile: To feare the Foe, since feare oppresseth strength, Giues in your weakenesse, strength vnto your Foe; Feare, and be slaine, no worse can come to sight, And fight and die, is death destroying death, Where fearing, dying, payes death seruile breath My Father hath a Power, enquire of him; And learne to make a Body of a Limbe Thou chid'st me well: proud Bullingbrooke I come To change Blowes with thee, for our day of Doome: This ague fit of feare is ouer-blowne, An easie taske it is to winne our owne. Say Scroope, where lyes our Vnckle with his Power? Speake sweetly man, although thy lookes be sowre Men iudge by the complexion of the Skie The state and inclination of the day; So may you by my dull and heauie Eye: My Tongue hath but a heauier Tale to say: I play the Torturer, by small and small To lengthen out the worst, that must be spoken. Your Vnckle Yorke is ioyn'd with Bullingbrooke, And all your Northerne Castles yeelded vp, And all your Southerne Gentlemen in Armes Vpon his Faction Thou hast said enough. Beshrew thee Cousin, which didst lead me forth Of that sweet way I was in, to despaire: What say you now? What comfort haue we now? By Heauen Ile hate him euerlastingly, That bids me be of comfort any more. Goe to Flint Castle, there Ile pine away, A King, Woes slaue, shall Kingly Woe obey: That Power I haue, discharge, and let 'em goe To eare the Land, that hath some hope to grow, For I haue none. Let no man speake againe To alter this, for counsaile is but vaine My Liege, one word He does me double wrong, That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue. Discharge my followers: let them hence away, From Richards Night, to Bullingbrookes faire Day. Scaena Tertia. Northumberland, So that by this intelligence we learne The Welchmen are dispers'd, and Salisbury Is gone to meet the King, who lately landed With some few priuate friends, vpon this Coast The newes is very faire and good, my Lord, Richard, not farre from hence, hath hid his head It would beseeme the Lord Northumberland, To say King Richard: alack the heauie day, When such a sacred King should hide his head Your Grace mistakes: onely to be briefe, Left I his Title out The time hath beene, Would you haue beene so briefe with him, he would Haue beene so briefe with you, to shorten you, For taking so the Head, your whole heads length Mistake not (Vnckle) farther then you should Take not (good Cousin) farther then you should. Least you mistake the Heauens are ore your head I know it (Vnckle) and oppose not my selfe Against their will. But who comes here? Welcome Harry: what, will not this Castle yeeld? The Castle royally is mann'd, my Lord, Against thy entrance Royally? Why, it containes no King? Yes (my good Lord) It doth containe a King: King Richard lyes And with him, the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury, Sir Stephen Scroope, besides a Clergie man Of holy reuerence; who, I cannot learne Oh, belike it is the Bishop of Carlile Noble Lord, Goe to the rude Ribs of that ancient Castle, Through Brazen Trumpet send the breath of Parle Into his ruin'd Eares, and thus deliuer: Henry Bullingbrooke vpon his knees doth kisse King Richards hand, and sends allegeance And true faith of heart to his Royall Person: hither come Euen at his feet, to lay my Armes and Power, Prouided, that my Banishment repeal'd, And Lands restor'd againe, be freely graunted: If not, Ile vse th 'aduantage of my Power, And lay the Summers dust with showers of blood, Rayn'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen; The which, how farre off from the mind of Bullingbrooke It is, such Crimson Tempest should bedrench The fresh greene Lap of faire King Richards Land, My stooping dutie tenderly shall shew. Goe signifie as much, while here we march Vpon the Grassie Carpet of this Plaine: Let's march without the noyse of threatning Drum, That from this Castles tatter'd Battlements Our faire Appointments may be well perus'd. Me thinkes King Richard and my selfe should meet With no lesse terror then the Elements Of Fire and Water, when their thundring smoake At meeting teares the cloudie Cheekes of Heauen: Be he the fire, Ile be the yeelding Water; The Rage be his, while on the Earth I raine My Waters on the Earth, and not on him. March on, and marke King Richard how he lookes. Parle without, and answere within: then a Flourish. Enter on the Walls, Richard, Carlile, Aumerle, Scroop, Salisbury. See, see, King Richard doth himselfe appeare As doth the blushing discontented Sunne, From out the fierie Portall of the East, When he perceiues the enuious Clouds are bent To dimme his glory, and to staine the tract Of his bright passage to the Occident Yet lookes he like a King: behold his Eye (As bright as is the Eagles) lightens forth Controlling Maiestie: alack, alack, for woe, That any harme should staine so faire a shew Wee are amaz'd, and thus long haue we stood To watch the fearefull bending of thy knee, Because we thought our selfe thy lawfull King: And if we be, how dare thy ioynts forget To pay their awfull dutie to our presence? If we be not, shew vs the Hand of God, That hath dismiss'd vs from our Stewardship, For well wee know, no Hand of Blood and Bone Can gripe the sacred Handle of our Scepter, Vnlesse he doe prophane, steale, or vsurpe. And though you thinke, that all, as you haue done, Haue torne their Soules, by turning them from vs, And we are barren, and bereft of Friends: Yet know, my Master, God Omnipotent, Is mustring in his Clouds, on our behalfe, Armies of Pestilence, and they shall strike Your Children yet vnborne, and vnbegot, That lift your Vassall Hands against my Head, And threat the Glory of my precious Crowne. Tell Bullingbrooke, for yond me thinkes he is, That euery stride he makes vpon my Land, Is dangerous Treason: He is come to ope The purple Testament of bleeding Warre; But ere the Crowne he lookes for, liue in peace, Ten thousand bloody crownes of Mothers Sonnes Shall ill become the flower of Englands face, Change the complexion of her Maid-pale Peace To Scarlet Indignation, and bedew Her Pastors Grasse with faithfull English Blood The King of Heauen forbid our Lord the King Should so with ciuill and vnciuill Armes Be rush'd vpon: Thy thrice-noble Cousin, Harry Bullingbrooke, doth humbly kisse thy hand, And by the Honorable Tombe he sweares, That stands vpon your Royall Grandsires Bones, And by the Royalties of both your Bloods, (Currents that spring from one most gracious Head) And by the buried Hand of Warlike Gaunt, And by the Worth and Honor of himselfe, Comprising all that may be sworne, or said, His comming hither hath no further scope, Then for his Lineall Royalties, and to begge Infranchisement immediate on his knees: Which on thy Royall partie graunted once, His glittering Armes he will commend to Rust, His barbed Steedes to Stables, and his heart To faithfull seruice of your Maiestie: This sweares he, as he is a Prince, is iust, And as I am a Gentleman, I credit him Northumberland, say thus: The King returnes, His Noble Cousin is right welcome hither, And all the number of his faire demands Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction: With all the gracious vtterance thou hast, Speake to his gentle hearing kind commends. We doe debase our selfe (Cousin) doe we not, To looke so poorely, and to speake so faire? Shall we call back Northumberland, and send Defiance to the Traytor, and so die? No, good my Lord, let's fight with gentle words, Till time lend friends, and friends their helpeful Swords Oh God, oh God, that ere this tongue of mine, That layd the Sentence of dread Banishment On yond prowd man, should take it off againe With words of sooth: Oh that I were as great As is my Griefe, or lesser then my Name, Or that I could forget what I haue beene, Or not remember what I must be now: Swell'st thou prowd heart? Ile giue thee scope to beat, Since Foes haue scope to beat both thee and me Northumberland comes backe from Bullingbrooke What must the King doe now? must he submit? The King shall doe it: Must he be depos'd? The King shall be contented: Must he loose The Name of King? o' Gods Name let it goe. Ile giue my Iewels for a sett of Beades, My gorgeous Pallace, for a Hermitage, My gay Apparrell, for an Almes-mans Gowne, My figur'd Goblets, for a Dish of Wood, My Scepter, for a Palmers walking Staffe, My Subiects, for a payre of carued Saints, And my large Kingdome, for a little Graue, A little little Graue, an obscure Graue. Or Ile be buryed in the Kings high-way, Some way of common Trade, where Subiects feet May howrely trample on their Soueraignes Head: For on my heart they tread now, whilest I liue; And buryed once, why not vpon my Head? Aumerle, thou weep'st (my tender-hearted Cousin) Wee'le make foule Weather with despised Teares: Our sighes, and they, shall lodge the Summer Corne, And make a Dearth in this reuolting Land. Or shall we play the Wantons with our Woes, And make some prettie Match, with shedding Teares? As thus: to drop them still vpon one place, Till they haue fretted vs a payre of Graues, Two Kinsmen, digg'd their Graues with weeping Eyes? Would not this ill, doe well? Well, well, I see I talke but idly, and you mock at mee. Most mightie Prince, my Lord Northumberland, What sayes King Bullingbrooke? Will his Maiestie Giue Richard leaue to liue, till Richard die? You make a Legge, and Bullingbrooke sayes I My Lord, in the base Court he doth attend To speake with you, may it please you to come downe Downe, downe I come, like glist'ring Phaeton, Wanting the manage of vnruly Iades. In the base Court? base Court, where Kings grow base, To come at Traytors Calls, and doe them Grace. In the base Court come down: down Court, down King, For night-Owls shrike, where mouting Larks should sing What sayes his Maiestie? Sorrow, and griefe of heart Makes him speake fondly, like a frantick man: Yet he is come Stand all apart, And shew faire dutie to his Maiestie. My gracious Lord Faire Cousin, You debase your Princely Knee, To make the base Earth prowd with kissing it. Me rather had, my Heart might feele your Loue, Then my vnpleas'd Eye see your Courtesie. Vp Cousin, vp, your Heart is vp, I know, Thus high at least, although your Knee be low My gracious Lord, I come but for mine owne Your owne is yours, and I am yours, and all So farre be mine, my most redoubted Lord, As my true seruice shall deserue your loue Well you deseru'd: They well deserue to haue, That know the strong'st, and surest way to get. Vnckle giue me your Hand: nay, drie your Eyes, Teares shew their Loue, but want their Remedies. Cousin, I am too young to be your Father, Though you are old enough to be my Heire. What you will haue, Ile giue, and willing to, For doe we must, what force will haue vs doe. Set on towards London: Cousin, is it so? Yea, my good Lord Then I must not say, no. Scena Quarta. What sport shall we deuise here in this Garden, To driue away the heauie thought of Care? Madame, wee'le play at Bowles 'Twill make me thinke the World is full of Rubs, And that my fortune runnes against the Byas Madame, wee'le Dance My Legges can keepe no measure in Delight, When my poore Heart no measure keepes in Griefe. Therefore no Dancing (Girle) some other sport Madame, wee'le tell Tales Of Sorrow, or of Griefe? Of eyther, Madame Of neyther, Girle. For if of Ioy, being altogether wanting, It doth remember me the more of Sorrow: Or if of Griefe, being altogether had, It addes more Sorrow to my want of Ioy: For what I haue, I need not to repeat; And what I want, it bootes not to complaine Madame, Ile sing 'Tis well that thou hast cause: But thou should'st please me better, would'st thou weepe I could weepe, Madame, would it doe you good And I could sing, would weeping doe me good, And neuer borrow any Teare of thee. But stay, here comes the Gardiners, Let's step into the shadow of these Trees. My wretchednesse, vnto a Rowe of Pinnes, They'le talke of State: for euery one doth so, Against a Change; Woe is fore-runne with Woe Goe binde thou vp yond dangling Apricocks, Which like vnruly Children, make their Syre Stoupe with oppression of their prodigall weight: Giue some supportance to the bending twigges. Goe thou, and like an Executioner Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprayes, That looke too loftie in our Common-wealth: All must be euen, in our Gouernment. You thus imploy'd, I will goe root away The noysome Weedes, that without profit sucke The Soyles fertilitie from wholesome flowers Why should we, in the compasse of a Pale, Keepe Law and Forme, and due Proportion, Shewing as in a Modell our firme Estate? When our Sea-walled Garden, the whole Land, Is full of Weedes, her fairest Flowers choakt vp, Her Fruit-trees all vnpruin'd, her Hedges ruin'd, Her Knots disorder'd, and her wholesome Hearbes Swarming with Caterpillers Hold thy peace. He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd Spring, Hath now himselfe met with the Fall of Leafe. The Weeds that his broad-spreading Leaues did shelter, That seem'd, in eating him, to hold him vp, Are pull'd vp, Root and all, by Bullingbrooke: I meane, the Earle of Wiltshire, Bushie, Greene What are they dead? They are, And Bullingbrooke hath seiz'd the wastefull King. Oh, what pitty is it, that he had not so trim'd And drest his Land, as we this Garden, at time of yeare, And wound the Barke, the skin of our Fruit-trees, Least being ouer-proud with Sap and Blood, With too much riches it confound it selfe? Had he done so, to great and growing men, They might haue liu'd to beare, and he to taste Their fruites of dutie. Superfluous branches We lop away, that bearing boughes may liue: Had he done so, himselfe had borne the Crowne, Which waste and idle houres, hath quite thrown downe What thinke you the King shall be depos'd? Deprest he is already, and depos'd 'Tis doubted he will be. Letters came last night To a deere Friend of the Duke of Yorkes, That tell blacke tydings Oh I am prest to death through want of speaking: Thou old Adams likenesse, set to dresse this Garden: How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this vnpleasing newes What Eue? what Serpent hath suggested thee, To make a second fall of cursed man? Why do'st thou say, King Richard is depos'd, Dar'st thou, thou little better thing then earth, Diuine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how Cam'st thou by this ill-tydings? Speake thou wretch Pardon me Madam. Little ioy haue I To breath these newes; yet what I say, is true; King Richard, he is in the mighty hold Of Bullingbrooke, their Fortunes both are weigh'd: In your Lords Scale, is nothing but himselfe, And some few Vanities, that make him light: But in the Ballance of great Bullingbrooke, Besides himselfe, are all the English Peeres, And with that oddes he weighes King Richard downe. Poste you to London, and you'l finde it so, I speake no more, then euery one doth know Nimble mischance, that art so light of foote, Doth not thy Embassage belong to me? And am I last that knowes it? Oh thou think'st To serue me last, that I may longest keepe Thy sorrow in my breast. Come Ladies goe, To meet at London, Londons King in woe. What was I borne to this: that my sad looke, Should grace the Triumph of great Bullingbrooke. Gard'ner, for telling me this newes of woe, I would the Plants thou graft'st, may neuer grow. Poore Queen, so that thy State might be no worse, I would my skill were subiect to thy curse: Heere did she drop a teare, heere in this place Ile set a Banke of Rew, sowre Herbe of Grace: Rue, eu'n for ruth, heere shortly shall be seene, In the remembrance of a Weeping Queene. Northumberland, Percie, FitzWater, Surrey, Carlile, Abbot of Westminster. Herauld, Officers, and Bagot. Call forth Bagot. Now Bagot, freely speake thy minde, What thou do'st know of Noble Glousters death: Who wrought it with the King, and who perform'd The bloody Office of his Timelesse end Then set before my face, the Lord Aumerle Cosin, stand forth, and looke vpon that man My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue Scornes to vnsay, what it hath once deliuer'd. In that dead time, when Glousters death was plotted, I heard you say, Is not my arme of length, That reacheth from the restfull English Court As farre as Callis, to my Vnkles head. Amongst much other talke, that very time, I heard you say, that you had rather refuse The offer of an hundred thousand Crownes, Then Bullingbrookes returne to England; adding withall, How blest this Land would be, in this your Cosins death Princes, and Noble Lords: What answer shall I make to this base man? Shall I so much dishonor my faire Starres, On equall termes to giue him chasticement? Either I must, or haue mine honor soyl'd With th' Attaindor of his sland'rous Lippes. There is my Gage, the manuall Seale of death That markes thee out for Hell. Thou lyest, And will maintaine what thou hast said, is false, In thy heart blood, though being all too base To staine the temper of my Knightly sword Bagot forbeare, thou shalt not take it vp Excepting one, I would he were the best In all this presence, that hath mou'd me so If that thy valour stand on sympathize: There is my Gage, Aumerle, in Gage to thine: By that faire Sunne, that shewes me where thou stand'st, I heard thee say (and vauntingly thou spak'st it) That thou wer't cause of Noble Glousters death. If thou deniest it, twenty times thou lyest, And I will turne thy falshood to thy hart, Where it was forged with my Rapiers point Thou dar'st not (Coward) liue to see the day Now by my Soule, I would it were this houre Fitzwater thou art damn'd to hell for this Aumerle, thou lye'st: his Honor is as true In this Appeale, as thou art all vniust: And that thou art so, there I throw my Gage To proue it on thee, to th' extreamest point Of mortall breathing. Seize it, if thou dar'st And if I do not, may my hands rot off, And neuer brandish more reuengefull Steele, Ouer the glittering Helmet of my Foe My Lord Fitzwater: I do remember well, the very time Aumerle, and you did talke My Lord, 'Tis very true: You were in presence then, And you can witnesse with me, this is true As false, by heauen, As Heauen it selfe is true Surrey, thou Lyest Dishonourable Boy; That Lye, shall lie so heauy on my Sword, That it shall render Vengeance, and Reuenge, Till thou the Lye-giuer, and that Lye, doe lye In earth as quiet, as thy Fathers Scull. In proofe whereof, there is mine Honors pawne, Engage it to the Triall, if thou dar'st How fondly do'st thou spurre a forward Horse? If I dare eate, or drinke, or breathe, or liue, I dare meete Surrey in a Wildernesse, And spit vpon him, whilest I say he Lyes, And Lyes, and Lyes: there is my Bond of Faith, To tye thee to my strong Correction. As I intend to thriue in this new World, Aumerle is guiltie of my true Appeale. Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolke say, That thou Aumerle didst send two of thy men, To execute the Noble Duke at Callis Some honest Christian trust me with a Gage, That Norfolke lyes: here doe I throw downe this, If he may be repeal'd, to trie his Honor These differences shall all rest vnder Gage, Till Norfolke be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be; And (though mine Enemie) restor'd againe To all his Lands and Seignories: when hee's return'd, Against Aumerle we will enforce his Tryall That honorable day shall ne're be seene. Many a time hath banish'd Norfolke fought For Iesu Christ, in glorious Christian field Streaming the Ensigne of the Christian Crosse, Against black Pagans, Turkes, and Saracens: And toyl'd with workes of Warre, retyr'd himselfe To Italy, and there at Venice gaue His Body to that pleasant Countries Earth, And his pure Soule vnto his Captaine Christ, Vnder whose Colours he had fought so long Why Bishop, is Norfolke dead? As sure as I liue, my Lord Sweet peace conduct his sweet Soule To the Bosome of good old Abraham. Lords Appealants, your differeces shal all rest vnder gage, Till we assigne you to your dayes of Tryall. Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee From plume-pluckt Richard, who with willing Soule Adopts thee Heire, and his high Scepter yeelds To the possession of thy Royall Hand. Ascend his Throne, descending now from him, And long liue Henry, of that Name the Fourth In Gods Name, Ile ascend the Regall Throne Mary, Heauen forbid. Worst in this Royall Presence may I speake, Yet best beseeming me to speake the truth. Would God, that any in this Noble Presence Were enough Noble, to be vpright Iudge Of Noble Richard: then true Noblenesse would Learne him forbearance from so foule a Wrong. What Subiect can giue Sentence on his King? And who sits here, that is not Richards Subiect? Theeues are not iudg'd, but they are by to heare, Although apparant guilt be seene in them: And shall the figure of Gods Maiestie, His Captaine, Steward, Deputie elect, Anoynted, Crown'd, planted many yeeres, Be iudg'd by subiect, and inferior breathe, And he himselfe not present? Oh, forbid it, God, That in a Christian Climate, Soules refin'de Should shew so heynous, black, obscene a deed. I speake to Subiects, and a Subiect speakes, Stirr'd vp by Heauen, thus boldly for his King My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call King, Is a foule Traytor to prowd Herefords King. And if you Crowne him, let me prophecie, The blood of English shall manure the ground, And future Ages groane for his foule Act. Peace shall goe sleepe with Turkes and Infidels, And in this Seat of Peace, tumultuous Warres Shall Kinne with Kinne, and Kinde with Kinde confound. Disorder, Horror, Feare, and Mutinie Shall here inhabite, and this Land be call'd The field of Golgotha, and dead mens Sculls. Oh, if you reare this House, against this House It will the wofullest Diuision proue, That euer fell vpon this cursed Earth. Preuent it, resist it, and let it not be so, Least Child, Childs Children cry against you, Woe Well haue you argu'd Sir: and for your paines, Of Capitall Treason we arrest you here. My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge, To keepe him safely, till his day of Tryall. May it please you, Lords, to grant the Commons Suit? Fetch hither Richard, that in common view He may surrender: so we shall proceede Without suspition I will be his Conduct. Lords, you that here are vnder our Arrest, Procure your Sureties for your Dayes of Answer: Little are we beholding to your Loue, And little look'd for at your helping Hands. Alack, why am I sent for to a King, Before I haue shooke off the Regall thoughts Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet haue learn'd To insinuate, flatter, bowe, and bend my Knee. Giue Sorrow leaue a while, to tuture me To this submission. Yet I well remember The fauors of these men: were they not mine? Did they not sometime cry, All hayle to me? So Iudas did to Christ: but he in twelue, Found truth in all, but one; I, in twelue thousand, none. God saue the King: will no man say, Amen? Am I both Priest, and Clarke? well then, Amen. God saue the King, although I be not hee: And yet Amen, if Heauen doe thinke him mee. To doe what seruice, am I sent for hither? To doe that office of thine owne good will, Which tyred Maiestie did make thee offer: The Resignation of thy State and Crowne To Henry Bullingbrooke Giue me the Crown. Here Cousin, seize y Crown: Here Cousin, on this side my Hand, on that side thine. Now is this Golden Crowne like a deepe Well, That owes two Buckets, filling one another, The emptier euer dancing in the ayre, The other downe, vnseene, and full of Water: That Bucket downe, and full of Teares am I, Drinking my Griefes, whil'st you mount vp on high I thought you had been willing to resigne My Crowne I am, but still my Griefes are mine: You may my Glories and my State depose, But not my Griefes; still am I King of those Part of your Cares you giue me with your Crowne Your Cares set vp, do not pluck my Cares downe. My Care, is losse of Care, by old Care done, Your Care, is gaine of Care, by new Care wonne: The Cares I giue, I haue, though giuen away, They 'tend the Crowne, yet still with me they stay: Are you contented to resigne the Crowne? I, no; no, I: for I must nothing bee: Therefore no, no, for I resigne to thee. Now, marke me how I will vndoe my selfe. I giue this heauie Weight from off my Head, And this vnwieldie Scepter from my Hand, The pride of Kingly sway from out my Heart. With mine owne Teares I wash away my Balme, With mine owne Hands I giue away my Crowne, With mine owne Tongue denie my Sacred State, With mine owne Breath release all dutious Oathes; All Pompe and Maiestie I doe forsweare: My Manors, Rents, Reuenues, I forgoe; My Acts, Decrees, and Statutes I denie: God pardon all Oathes that are broke to mee, God keepe all Vowes vnbroke are made to thee. Make me that nothing haue, with nothing grieu'd, And thou with all pleas'd, that hast all atchieu'd. Long may'st thou liue in Richards Seat to sit, And soone lye Richard in an Earthie Pit. God saue King Henry, vn-King'd Richard sayes, And send him many yeeres of Sunne-shine dayes. What more remaines? No more: but that you reade These Accusations, and these grieuous Crymes, Committed by your Person, and your followers, Against the State, and Profit of this Land: That by confessing them, the Soules of men May deeme, that you are worthily depos'd Must I doe so? and must I rauell out My weau'd-vp follyes? Gentle Northumberland, If thy Offences were vpon Record, Would it not shame thee, in so faire a troupe, To reade a Lecture of them? If thou would'st, There should'st thou finde one heynous Article, Contayning the deposing of a King, And cracking the strong Warrant of an Oath, Mark'd with a Blot, damn'd in the Booke of Heauen. Nay, all of you, that stand and looke vpon me, Whil'st that my wretchednesse doth bait my selfe, Though some of you, with Pilate, wash your hands, Shewing an outward pittie: yet you Pilates Haue here deliuer'd me to my sowre Crosse, And Water cannot wash away your sinne My Lord dispatch, reade o're these Articles Mine Eyes are full of Teares, I cannot see: And yet salt-Water blindes them not so much, But they can see a sort of Traytors here. Nay, if I turne mine Eyes vpon my selfe, I finde my selfe a Traytor with the rest: For I haue giuen here my Soules consent, T' vndeck the pompous Body of a King; Made Glory base; a Soueraigntie, a Slaue; Prowd Maiestie, a Subiect; State, a Pesant My Lord No Lord of thine, thou haught-insulting man; No, nor no mans Lord: I haue no Name, no Title; No, not that Name was giuen me at the Font, But 'tis vsurpt: alack the heauie day, That I haue worne so many Winters out, And know not now, what Name to call my selfe. Oh, that I were a Mockerie, King of Snow, Standing before the Sunne of Bullingbrooke, To melt my selfe away in Water-drops. Good King, great King, and yet not greatly good, And if my word be Sterling yet in England, Let it command a Mirror hither straight, That it may shew me what a Face I haue, Since it is Bankrupt of his Maiestie Goe some of you, and fetch a Looking-Glasse Read o're this Paper, while y Glasse doth come Fiend, thou torments me, ere I come to Hell Vrge it no more, my Lord Northumberland The Commons will not then be satisfy'd They shall be satisfy'd: Ile reade enough, When I doe see the very Booke indeede, Where all my sinnes are writ, and that's my selfe. Giue me that Glasse, and therein will I reade. No deeper wrinckles yet? hath Sorrow strucke So many Blowes vpon this Face of mine, And made no deeper Wounds? Oh flatt'ring Glasse, Like to my followers in prosperitie, Thou do'st beguile me. Was this Face, the Face That euery day, vnder his House-hold Roofe, Did keepe ten thousand men? Was this the Face, That like the Sunne, did make beholders winke? Is this the Face, which fac'd so many follyes, That was at last out-fac'd by Bullingbrooke? A brittle Glory shineth in this Face, As brittle as the Glory, is the Face, For there it is, crackt in an hundred shiuers. Marke silent King, the Morall of this sport, How soone my Sorrow hath destroy'd my Face The shadow of your Sorrow hath destroy'd The shadow of your Face Say that againe. The shadow of my Sorrow: ha, let's see, 'Tis very true, my Griefe lyes all within, And these externall manner of Laments, Are meerely shadowes, to the vnseene Griefe, That swells with silence in the tortur'd Soule. There lyes the substance: and I thanke thee King For thy great bountie, that not onely giu'st Me cause to wayle, but teachest me the way How to lament the cause. Ile begge one Boone, And then be gone, and trouble you no more. Shall I obtaine it? Name it, faire Cousin Faire Cousin? I am greater then a King: For when I was a King, my flatterers Were then but subiects; being now a subiect, I haue a King here to my flatterer: Being so great, I haue no neede to begge Yet aske And shall I haue? You shall Then giue me leaue to goe Whither? Whither you will, so I were from your sights Goe some of you, conuey him to the Tower Oh good: conuey: Conueyers are you all, That rise thus nimbly by a true Kings fall On Wednesday next, we solemnly set downe Our Coronation: Lords, prepare your selues. A wofull Pageant haue we here beheld The Woes to come, the Children yet vnborne, Shall feele this day as sharpe to them as Thorne You holy Clergie-men, is there no Plot To rid the Realme of this pernicious Blot Before I freely speake my minde herein, You shall not onely take the Sacrament, To bury mine intents, but also to effect What euer I shall happen to deuise. I see your Browes are full of Discontent, Your Heart of Sorrow, and your Eyes of Teares. Come home with me to Supper, Ile lay a Plot Shall shew vs all a merry day. This way the King will come: this is the way To Iulius Cæsars ill-erected Tower: To whose flint Bosome, my condemned Lord Is doom'd a Prisoner, by prowd Bullingbrooke. Here let vs rest, if this rebellious Earth Haue any resting for her true Kings Queene. But soft, but see, or rather doe not see, My faire Rose wither: yet looke vp; behold, That you in pittie may dissolue to dew, And wash him fresh againe with true-loue Teares. Ah thou, the Modell where old Troy did stand, Thou Mappe of Honor, thou King Richards Tombe, And not King Richard: thou most beauteous Inne, Why should hard-fauor'd Griefe be lodg'd in thee, When Triumph is become an Ale-house Guest Ioyne not with griefe, faire Woman, do not so, To make my end too sudden: learne good Soule, To thinke our former State a happie Dreame, From which awak'd, the truth of what we are, Shewes vs but this. I am sworne Brother (Sweet) To grim Necessitie; and hee and I Will keepe a League till Death. High thee to France, And Cloyster thee in some Religious House: Our holy liues must winne a new Worlds Crowne, Which our prophane houres here haue stricken downe What, is my Richard both in shape and minde Transform'd, and weaken'd? Hath Bullingbrooke Depos'd thine Intellect? hath he beene in thy Heart? The Lyon dying, thrusteth forth his Paw, And wounds the Earth, if nothing else, with rage To be o're-powr'd: and wilt thou, Pupill-like, Take thy Correction mildly, kisse the Rodde, And fawne on Rage with base Humilitie, Which art a Lyon, and a King of Beasts? A King of Beasts indeed: if aught but Beasts, I had beene still a happy King of Men. Good (sometime Queene) prepare thee hence for France: Thinke I am dead, and that euen here thou tak'st, As from my Death-bed, my last liuing leaue. In Winters tedious Nights sit by the fire With good old folkes, and let them tell thee Tales Of wofull Ages, long agoe betide: And ere thou bid good-night, to quit their griefe, Tell thou the lamentable fall of me, And send the hearers weeping to their Beds: For why? the sencelesse Brands will sympathize The heauie accent of thy mouing Tongue, And in compassion, weepe the fire out: And some will mourne in ashes, some coale-black, For the deposing of a rightfull King. My Lord, the mind of Bullingbrooke is chang'd. You must to Pomfret, not vnto the Tower. And Madame, there is order ta'ne for you: With all swift speed, you must away to France Northumberland, thou Ladder wherewithall The mounting Bullingbrooke ascends my Throne, The time shall not be many houres of age, More then it is, ere foule sinne, gathering head, Shall breake into corruption: thou shalt thinke, Though he diuide the Realme, and giue thee halfe, It is too little, helping him to all: He shall thinke, that thou which know'st the way To plant vnrightfull Kings, wilt know againe, Being ne're so little vrg'd another way, To pluck him headlong from the vsurped Throne. The Loue of wicked friends conuerts to Feare; That Feare, to Hate; and Hate turnes one, or both, To worthie Danger, and deserued Death My guilt be on my Head, and there an end: Take leaue, and part, for you must part forthwith Doubly diuorc'd? (bad men) ye violate A two-fold Marriage; 'twixt my Crowne, and me. And then betwixt me, and my marryed Wife. Let me vn-kisse the Oath 'twixt thee, and me; And yet not so, for with a Kisse 'twas made. Part vs, Northumberland: I, towards the North, Where shiuering Cold and Sicknesse pines the Clyme: My Queene to France: from whence, set forth in pompe, She came adorned hither like sweet May; Sent back like Hollowmas, or short'st of day And must we be diuided? must we part? I, hand from hand (my Loue) and heart fro heart Banish vs both, and send the King with me That were some Loue, but little Pollicy Then whither he goes, thither let me goe So two together weeping, make one Woe. Weepe thou for me in France; I, for thee heere: Better farre off, then neere, be ne're the neere. Goe, count thy Way with Sighes; I, mine with Groanes So longest Way shall haue the longest Moanes Twice for one step Ile groane, y Way being short, And peece the Way out with a heauie heart. Come, come, in wooing Sorrow let's be briefe, Since wedding it, there is such length in Griefe: One Kisse shall stop our mouthes, and dumbely part; Thus giue I mine, and thus take I thy heart Giue me mine owne againe: 'twere no good part, To take on me to keepe, and kill thy heart. So, now I haue mine owne againe, be gone, That I may striue to kill it with a groane We make Woe wanton with this fond delay: Once more adieu; the rest, let Sorrow say. Scoena Secunda. My Lord, you told me you would tell the rest, When weeping made you breake the story off, Of our two Cousins comming into London Where did I leaue? At that sad stoppe, my Lord, Where rude mis-gouern'd hands, from Windowes tops, Threw dust and rubbish on King Richards head Then, as I said, the Duke, great Bullingbrooke, Mounted vpon a hot and fierie Steed, Which his aspiring Rider seem'd to know, With slow, but stately pace, kept on his course: While all tongues cride, God saue thee Bullingbrooke. You would haue thought the very windowes spake, So many greedy lookes of yong and old, Through Casements darted their desiring eyes Vpon his visage: and that all the walles, With painted Imagery had said at once, Iesu preserue thee, welcom Bullingbrooke. Whil'st he, from one side to the other turning, Bare-headed, lower then his proud Steeds necke, Bespake them thus: I thanke you Countrimen: And thus still doing, thus he past along Alas poore Richard, where rides he the whilst? As in a Theater, the eyes of men After a well grac'd Actor leaues the Stage, Are idlely bent on him that enters next, Thinking his prattle to be tedious: Euen so, or with much more contempt, mens eyes Did scowle on Richard: no man cride, God saue him: No ioyfull tongue gaue him his welcome home, But dust was throwne vpon his Sacred head, Which with such gentle sorrow he shooke off, His face still combating with teares and smiles (The badges of his greefe and patience) That had not God (for some strong purpose) steel'd The hearts of men, they must perforce haue melted, And Barbarisme it selfe haue pittied him. But heauen hath a hand in these euents, To whose high will we bound our calme contents. To Bullingbrooke, are we sworne Subiects now, Whose State, and Honor, I for aye allow. Heere comes my sonne Aumerle Aumerle that was, But that is lost, for being Richards Friend. And Madam, you must call him Rutland now: I am in Parliament pledge for his truth, And lasting fealtie to the new-made King Welcome my sonne: who are the Violets now, That strew the greene lap of the new-come Spring? Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not, God knowes, I had as liefe be none, as one Well, beare you well in this new-spring of time Least you be cropt before you come to prime. What newes from Oxford? Hold those Iusts & Triumphs? For ought I know my Lord, they do You will be there I know If God preuent not, I purpose so What Seale is that that hangs without thy bosom? Yea, look'st thou pale? Let me see the Writing My Lord, 'tis nothing No matter then who sees it, I will be satisfied, let me see the Writing I do beseech your Grace to pardon me, It is a matter of small consequence, Which for some reasons I would not haue seene Which for some reasons sir, I meane to see: I feare, I feare What should you feare? 'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into For gay apparrell, against the Triumph Bound to himselfe? What doth he with a Bond That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a foole. Boy, let me see the Writing I do beseech you pardon me, I may not shew it I will be satisfied: let me see it I say. Snatches it Treason, foule Treason, Villaine, Traitor, Slaue What's the matter, my Lord? Hoa, who's within there? Saddle my horse. Heauen for his mercy: what treachery is heere? Why, what is't my Lord? Giue me my boots, I say: Saddle my horse: Now by my Honor, my life, my troth, I will appeach the Villaine What is the matter? Peace foolish Woman I will not peace. What is the matter Sonne? Good Mother be content, it is no more Then my poore life must answer Thy life answer? Bring me my Boots, I will vnto the King Strike him Aumerle. Poore boy, y art amaz'd, Hence Villaine, neuer more come in my sight Giue me my Boots, I say Why Yorke, what wilt thou do? Wilt thou not hide the Trespasse of thine owne? Haue we more Sonnes? Or are we like to haue? Is not my teeming date drunke vp with time? And wilt thou plucke my faire Sonne from mine Age, And rob me of a happy Mothers name? Is he not like thee? Is he not thine owne? Thou fond mad woman: Wilt thou conceale this darke Conspiracy? A dozen of them heere haue tane the Sacrament, And interchangeably set downe their hands To kill the King at Oxford He shall be none: Wee'l keepe him heere: then what is that to him? Away fond woman: were hee twenty times my Son, I would appeach him Hadst thou groan'd for him as I haue done, Thou wouldest be more pittifull: But now I know thy minde; thou do'st suspect That I haue bene disloyall to thy bed, And that he is a Bastard, not thy Sonne: Sweet Yorke, sweet husband, be not of that minde: He is as like thee, as a man may bee, Not like to me, nor any of my Kin, And yet I loue him Make way, vnruly Woman. After Aumerle. Mount thee vpon his horse, Spurre post, and get before him to the King, And begge thy pardon, ere he do accuse thee, Ile not be long behind: though I be old, I doubt not but to ride as fast as Yorke: And neuer will I rise vp from the ground, Till Bullingbrooke haue pardon'd thee: Away be gone. Scoena Tertia. Can no man tell of my vnthriftie Sonne? 'Tis full three monthes since I did see him last. If any plague hang ouer vs, 'tis he, I would to heauen (my Lords) he might be found: Enquire at London, 'mongst the Tauernes there: For there (they say) he dayly doth frequent, With vnrestrained loose Companions, Euen such (they say) as stand in narrow Lanes, And rob our Watch, and beate our passengers, Which he, yong wanton, and effeminate Boy Takes on the point of Honor, to support So dissolute a crew My Lord, some two dayes since I saw the Prince, And told him of these Triumphes held at Oxford And what said the Gallant? His answer was: he would vnto the Stewes, And from the common'st creature plucke a Gloue And weare it as a fauour, and with that He would vnhorse the lustiest Challenger As dissolute as desp'rate, yet through both, I see some sparkes of better hope: which elder dayes May happily bring forth. But who comes heere? Where is the King? What meanes our Cosin, that hee stares And lookes so wildely? God saue your Grace. I do beseech your Maiesty To haue some conference with your Grace alone Withdraw your selues, and leaue vs here alone: What is the matter with our Cosin now? For euer may my knees grow to the earth, My tongue cleaue to my roofe within my mouth, Vnlesse a Pardon, ere I rise, or speake Intended, or committed was this fault? If on the first, how heynous ere it bee, To win thy after loue, I pardon thee Then giue me leaue, that I may turne the key, That no man enter, till my tale be done Haue thy desire. Yorke within. My Liege beware, looke to thy selfe, Thou hast a Traitor in thy presence there Villaine, Ile make thee safe Stay thy reuengefull hand, thou hast no cause to feare Open the doore, secure foole-hardy King: Shall I for loue speake treason to thy face? Open the doore, or I will breake it open. What is the matter (Vnkle) speak, recouer breath, Tell vs how neere is danger, That we may arme vs to encounter it Peruse this writing heere, and thou shalt know The reason that my haste forbids me show Remember as thou read'st, thy promise past: I do repent me, reade not my name there, My heart is not confederate with my hand It was (villaine) ere thy hand did set it downe. I tore it from the Traitors bosome, King. Feare, and not Loue, begets his penitence; Forget to pitty him, least thy pitty proue A Serpent, that will sting thee to the heart Oh heinous, strong, and bold Conspiracie, O loyall Father of a treacherous Sonne: Thou sheere, immaculate, and siluer fountaine, From whence this streame, through muddy passages Hath had his current, and defil'd himselfe. Thy ouerflow of good, conuerts to bad, And thy abundant goodnesse shall excuse This deadly blot, in thy digressing sonne So shall my Vertue be his Vices bawd, And he shall spend mine Honour, with his Shame; As thriftlesse Sonnes, their scraping Fathers Gold. Mine honor liues, when his dishonor dies, Or my sham'd life, in his dishonor lies: Thou kill'st me in his life, giuing him breath, The Traitor liues, the true man's put to death. Dutchesse within. What hoa (my Liege) for heauens sake let me in What shrill-voic'd Suppliant, makes this eager cry? A woman, and thine Aunt (great King) 'tis I. Speake with me, pitty me, open the dore, A Begger begs, that neuer begg'd before Our Scene is alter'd from a serious thing, And now chang'd to the Begger, and the King. My dangerous Cosin, let your Mother in, I know she's come, to pray for your foule sin If thou do pardon, whosoeuer pray, More sinnes for this forgiuenesse, prosper may. This fester'd ioynt cut off, the rest rests sound, This let alone, will all the rest confound. O King, beleeue not this hard-hearted man, Loue, louing not it selfe, none other can Thou franticke woman, what dost y make here, Shall thy old dugges, once more a Traitor reare? Sweet Yorke be patient, heare me gentle Liege Rise vp good Aunt Not yet, I thee beseech. For euer will I kneele vpon my knees, And neuer see day, that the happy sees, Till thou giue ioy: vntill thou bid me ioy, By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing Boy Vnto my mothers prayres, I bend my knee Against them both, my true ioynts bended be Pleades he in earnest? Looke vpon his Face, His eyes do drop no teares: his prayres are in iest: His words come from his mouth, ours from our brest. He prayes but faintly, and would be denide, We pray with heart, and soule, and all beside: His weary ioynts would gladly rise, I know, Our knees shall kneele, till to the ground they grow: His prayers are full of false hypocrisie, Ours of true zeale, and deepe integritie: Our prayers do out-pray his, then let them haue That mercy, which true prayers ought to haue Good Aunt stand vp Nay, do not say stand vp. But Pardon first, and afterwards stand vp. And if I were thy Nurse, thy tongue to teach, Pardon should be the first word of thy speach. I neuer long'd to heare a word till now: Say Pardon (King,) let pitty teach thee how. The word is short: but not so short as sweet, No word like Pardon, for Kings mouth's so meet Speake it in French (King) say Pardon'ne moy Dost thou teach pardon, Pardon to destroy? Ah my sowre husband, my hard-hearted Lord, That set's the word it selfe, against the word. Speake Pardon, as 'tis currant in our Land, The chopping French we do not vnderstand. Thine eye begins to speake, set thy tongue there, Or in thy pitteous heart, plant thou thine eare, That hearing how our plaints and prayres do pearce, Pitty may moue thee, Pardon to rehearse Good Aunt, stand vp I do not sue to stand, Pardon is all the suite I haue in hand I pardon him, as heauen shall pardon mee O happy vantage of a kneeling knee? Yet am I sicke for feare: Speake it againe, Twice saying Pardon, doth not pardon twaine, But makes one pardon strong I pardon him with all my hart A God on earth thou art But for our trusty brother-in-Law, the Abbot, With all the rest of that consorted crew, Destruction straight shall dogge them at the heeles: Good Vnckle helpe to order seuerall powres To Oxford, or where ere these Traitors are: They shall not liue within this world I sweare, But I will haue them, if I once know where. Vnckle farewell, and Cosin adieu: Your mother well hath praid, and proue you true Come my old son, I pray heauen make thee new. Didst thou not marke the King what words hee spake? Haue I no friend will rid me of this liuing feare: Was it not so? Those were his very words. Haue I no Friend? (quoth he:) he spake it twice, And vrg'd it twice together, did he not? He did. And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me, As who should say, I would thou wer't the man That would diuorce this terror from my heart, Meaning the King at Pomfret: Come, let's goe; I am the Kings Friend, and will rid his Foe. Scaena Quarta. I haue bin studying, how to compare This Prison where I liue, vnto the World: And for because the world is populous, And heere is not a Creature, but my selfe, I cannot do it: yet Ile hammer't out. My Braine, Ile proue the Female to my Soule, My Soule, the Father: and these two beget A generation of still breeding Thoughts; And these same Thoughts, people this Little World In humors, like the people of this world, For no thought is contented. The better sort, As thoughts of things Diuine, are intermixt With scruples, and do set the Faith it selfe Against the Faith: as thus: Come litle ones: & then again, It is as hard to come, as for a Camell To thred the posterne of a Needles eye. Thoughts tending to Ambition, they do plot Vnlikely wonders; how these vaine weake nailes May teare a passage through the Flinty ribbes Of this hard world, my ragged prison walles: And for they cannot, dye in their owne pride. Thoughts tending to Content, flatter themselues, That they are not the first of Fortunes slaues, Nor shall not be the last. Like silly Beggars, Who sitting in the Stockes, refuge their shame That many haue, and others must sit there; And in this Thought, they finde a kind of ease, Bearing their owne misfortune on the backe Of such as haue before indur'd the like. Thus play I in one Prison, many people, And none contented. Sometimes am I King; Then Treason makes me wish my selfe a Beggar, And so I am. Then crushing penurie, Perswades me, I was better when a King: Then am I king'd againe: and by and by, Thinke that I am vn-king'd by Bullingbrooke, And straight am nothing. But what ere I am, Musick Nor I, nor any man, that but man is, With nothing shall be pleas'd, till he be eas'd With being nothing. Musicke do I heare? Ha, ha? keepe time: How sowre sweet Musicke is, When Time is broke, and no Proportion kept? So is it in the Musicke of mens liues: And heere haue I the daintinesse of eare, To heare time broke in a disorder'd string: But for the Concord of my State and Time, Had not an eare to heare my true Time broke. I wasted Time, and now doth Time waste me: For now hath Time made me his numbring clocke; My Thoughts, are minutes; and with Sighes they iarre, Their watches on vnto mine eyes, the outward Watch, Whereto my finger, like a Dialls point, Is pointing still, in cleansing them from teares. Now sir, the sound that tels what houre it is, Are clamorous groanes, that strike vpon my heart, Which is the bell: so Sighes, and Teares, and Grones, Shew Minutes, Houres, and Times: but my Time Runs poasting on, in Bullingbrookes proud ioy, While I stand fooling heere, his iacke o'th' Clocke. This Musicke mads me, let it sound no more, For though it haue holpe madmen to their wits, In me it seemes, it will make wise-men mad: Yet blessing on his heart that giues it me; For 'tis a signe of loue, and loue to Richard, Is a strange Brooch, in this all-hating world. Haile Royall Prince Thankes Noble Peere, The cheapest of vs, is ten groates too deere. What art thou? And how com'st thou hither? Where no man euer comes, but that sad dogge That brings me food, to make misfortune liue? I was a poore Groome of thy Stable (King) When thou wer't King: who trauelling towards Yorke, With much adoo, at length haue gotten leaue To looke vpon my (sometimes Royall) masters face. O how it yern'd my heart, when I beheld In London streets, that Coronation day, When Bullingbrooke rode on Roane Barbary, That horse, that thou so often hast bestrid, That horse, that I so carefully haue drest Rode he on Barbary? Tell me gentle Friend, How went he vnder him? So proudly, as if he had disdain'd the ground So proud, that Bullingbrooke was on his backe; That Iade hath eate bread from my Royall hand. This hand hath made him proud with clapping him. Would he not stumble? Would he not fall downe (Since Pride must haue a fall) and breake the necke Of that proud man, that did vsurpe his backe? Forgiuenesse horse: Why do I raile on thee, Since thou created to be aw'd by man Was't borne to beare? I was not made a horse, And yet I beare a burthen like an Asse, Spur-gall'd, and tyrd by iauncing Bullingbrooke. Fellow, giue place, heere is no longer stay If thou loue me, 'tis time thou wer't away What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say. My Lord, wilt please you to fall too? Taste of it first, as thou wer't wont to doo My Lord I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, Who lately came from th' King, commands the contrary The diuell take Henrie of Lancaster, and thee; Patience is stale, and I am weary of it Helpe, helpe, helpe. How now? what meanes Death in this rude assalt? Villaine, thine owne hand yeelds thy deaths instrument, Go thou and fill another roome in hell. Exton strikes him downe. That hand shall burne in neuer-quenching fire, That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand, Hath with the Kings blood, stain'd the Kings own land. Mount, mount my soule, thy seate is vp on high, Whil'st my grosse flesh sinkes downward, heere to dye As full of Valor, as of Royall blood, Both haue I spilt: Oh would the deed were good. For now the diuell, that told me I did well, Sayes, that this deede is chronicled in hell. This dead King to the liuing King Ile beare, Take hence the rest, and giue them buriall heere. Scoena Quinta. attendants. Kinde Vnkle Yorke, the latest newes we heare, Is that the Rebels haue consum'd with fire Our Towne of Cicester in Gloucestershire, But whether they be tane or slaine, we heare not. Welcome my Lord: What is the newes? First to thy Sacred State, wish I all happinesse: The next newes is, I haue to London sent The heads of Salsbury, Spencer, Blunt, and Kent: The manner of their taking may appeare At large discoursed in this paper heere We thank thee gentle Percy for thy paines, And to thy worth will adde right worthy gaines. My Lord, I haue from Oxford sent to London, The heads of Broccas, and Sir Bennet Seely, Two of the dangerous consorted Traitors, That sought at Oxford, thy dire ouerthrow Thy paines Fitzwaters shall not be forgot, Right Noble is thy merit, well I wot. The grand Conspirator, Abbot of Westminster, With clog of Conscience, and sowre Melancholly, Hath yeelded vp his body to the graue: But heere is Carlile, liuing to abide Thy Kingly doome, and sentence of his pride Carlile, this is your doome: Choose out some secret place, some reuerend roome More then thou hast, and with it ioy thy life: So as thou liu'st in peace, dye free from strife: For though mine enemy, thou hast euer beene, High sparkes of Honor in thee haue I seene. Great King, within this Coffin I present Thy buried feare. Heerein all breathlesse lies The mightiest of thy greatest enemies Richard of Burdeaux, by me hither brought Exton, I thanke thee not, for thou hast wrought A deede of Slaughter, with thy fatall hand, Vpon my head, and all this famous Land. From your owne mouth my Lord, did I this deed They loue not poyson, that do poyson neede, Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead, I hate the Murtherer, loue him murthered. The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour, But neither my good word, nor Princely fauour. With Caine go wander through the shade of night, And neuer shew thy head by day, nor light. Lords, I protest my soule is full of woe, That blood should sprinkle me, to make me grow. Come mourne with me, for that I do lament, And put on sullen Blacke incontinent: Ile make a voyage to the Holy-land, To wash this blood off from my guilty hand. March sadly after, grace my mourning heere, In weeping after this vntimely Beere. House of Gregory: A my word wee'l not carry coales No, for then we should be Colliars I mean, if we be in choller, wee'l draw I, While you liue, draw your necke out o'th Collar I strike quickly, being mou'd But thou art not quickly mou'd to strike A dog of the house of Mountague, moues me To moue, is to stir: and to be valiant, is to stand: Therefore, if thou art mou'd, thou runst away A dogge of that house shall moue me to stand. I will take the wall of any Man or Maid of Mountagues That shewes thee a weake slaue, for the weakest goes to the wall True, and therefore women being the weaker Vessels, are euer thrust to the wall: therefore I will push Mountagues men from the wall, and thrust his Maides to the wall The Quarrell is betweene our Masters, and vs their men 'Tis all one, I will shew my selfe a tyrant: when I haue fought with the men, I will bee ciuill with the Maids, and cut off their heads The heads of the Maids?

Turne thee Benuolio, looke vpon thy death I do but keepe the peace, put vp thy Sword, Or manage it to part these men with me What draw, and talke of peace?

What noise is this? Giue me my long Sword ho A crutch, a crutch: why call you for a Sword? My Sword I say: Old Mountague is come, And flourishes his Blade in spight of me. Thou villaine Capulet. Hold me not, let me go 2.Wife. Thou shalt not stir a foote to seeke a Foe. Rebellious Subiects, Enemies to peace, Prophaners of this Neighbor-stained Steele, Will they not heare? What hoe, you Men, you Beasts, That quench the fire of your pernitious Rage, With purple Fountaines issuing from your Veines: On paine of Torture, from those bloody hands Throw your mistemper'd Weapons to the ground, And heare the Sentence of your mooued Prince. Three ciuill Broyles, bred of an Ayery word, By thee old Capulet and Mountague, Haue thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets, And made Verona's ancient Citizens Cast by their Graue beseeming Ornaments, To wield old Partizans, in hands as old, Cankred with peace, to part your Cankred hate, If euer you disturbe our streets againe, Your liues shall pay the forfeit of the peace. For this time all the rest depart away: You Capulet shall goe along with me, And Mountague come you this afternoone, To know our Fathers pleasure in this case: To old Free-towne, our common iudgement place: Once more on paine of death, all men depart. Who set this auncient quarrell new abroach? Speake Nephew, were you by, when it began: Heere were the seruants of your aduersarie, And yours close fighting ere I did approach, I drew to part them, in the instant came The fiery Tibalt, with his sword prepar'd, Which as he breath'd defiance to my eares, He swong about his head, and cut the windes, Who nothing hurt withall, hist him in scorne. While we were enterchanging thrusts and blowes, Came more and more, and fought on part and part, Till the Prince came, who parted either part O where is Romeo, saw you him to day? Right glad am I, he was not at this fray Madam, an houre before the worshipt Sun Peer'd forth the golden window of the East, A troubled mind draue me to walke abroad, Where vnderneath the groue of Sycamour, That West-ward rooteth from this City side: So earely walking did I see your Sonne: Towards him I made, but he was ware of me, And stole into the couert of the wood, I measuring his affections by my owne, Which then most sought, wher most might not be found: Being one too many by my weary selfe, Pursued my Honour, not pursuing his And gladly shunn'd, who gladly fled from me Many a morning hath he there beene seene, With teares augmenting the fresh mornings deaw, Adding to cloudes, more cloudes with his deepe sighes, But all so soone as the all-cheering Sunne, Should in the farthest East begin to draw The shadie Curtaines from Auroras bed, Away from light steales home my heauy Sonne, And priuate in his Chamber pennes himselfe, Shuts vp his windowes, lockes faire day-light out, And makes himselfe an artificiall night: Blacke and portendous must this humour proue, Vnlesse good counsell may the cause remoue My Noble Vncle doe you know the cause? I neither know it, nor can learne of him Haue you importun'd him by any meanes? Both by my selfe and many other Friends, But he his owne affections counseller, Is to himselfe (I will not say how true) But to himselfe so secret and so close, So farre from sounding and discouery, As is the bud bit with an enuious worme, Ere he can spread his sweete leaues to the ayre, Or dedicate his beauty to the same. Could we but learne from whence his sorrowes grow, We would as willingly giue cure, as know. See where he comes, so please you step aside, Ile know his greeuance, or be much denide I would thou wert so happy by thy stay, To heare true shrift. Come Madam let's away. Good morrow Cousin Is the day so young? But new strooke nine Aye me, sad houres seeme long: Was that my Father that went hence so fast? It was: what sadnes lengthens Romeo's houres? Not hauing that, which hauing, makes them short In loue Out Of loue Out of her fauour where I am in loue Alas that loue so gentle in his view, Should be so tyrannous and rough in proofe Alas that loue, whose view is muffled still, Should without eyes, see path-wayes to his will: Where shall we dine? O me: what fray was heere? Yet tell me not, for I haue heard it all: Heere's much to do with hate, but more with loue: Why then, O brawling loue, O louing hate, O any thing, of nothing first created: O heauie lightnesse, serious vanity, Mishapen Chaos of welseeming formes, Feather of lead, bright smoake, cold fire, sicke health, Still waking sleepe, that is not what it is: This loue feele I, that feele no loue in this. Doest thou not laugh? No Coze, I rather weepe Good heart, at what? At thy good hearts oppression Why such is loues transgression. Griefes of mine owne lie heauie in my breast, Which thou wilt propagate to haue it preast With more of thine, this loue that thou hast showne, Doth adde more griefe, to too much of mine owne. Loue, is a smoake made with the fume of sighes, Being purg'd, a fire sparkling in Louers eyes, Being vext, a Sea nourisht with louing teares, What is it else? a madnesse, most discreet, A choking gall, and a preseruing sweet: Farewell my Coze Soft I will goe along. And if you leaue me so, you do me wrong Tut I haue lost my selfe, I am not here, This is not Romeo, hee's some other where Tell me in sadnesse, who is that you loue? What shall I grone and tell thee? Grone, why no: but sadly tell me who A sicke man in sadnesse makes his will: A word ill vrg'd to one that is so ill: In sadnesse Cozin, I do loue a woman I aym'd so neare, when I suppos'd you lou'd A right good marke man, and shee's faire I loue A right faire marke, faire Coze, is soonest hit Well in that hit you misse, sheel not be hit With Cupids arrow, she hath Dians wit: And in strong proofe of chastity well arm'd: From loues weake childish Bow, she liues vncharm'd. Shee will not stay the siege of louing tearmes, Nor bid th' encounter of assailing eyes. Nor open her lap to Sainct-seducing Gold: O she is rich in beautie, onely poore, That when she dies, with beautie dies her store Then she hath sworne, that she will still liue chast? She hath, and in that sparing make huge wast? For beauty steru'd with her seuerity, Cuts beauty off from all posteritie. She is too faire, too wise: wisely too faire, To merit blisse by making me dispaire: She hath forsworne to loue, and in that vow Do I liue dead, that liue to tell it now Be rul'd by me, forget to thinke of her O teach me how I should forget to thinke By giuing liberty vnto thine eyes, Examine other beauties, 'Tis the way to cal hers (exquisit) in question more, These happy maskes that kisse faire Ladies browes, Being blacke, puts vs in mind they hide the faire: He that is strooken blind, cannot forget The precious treasure of his eye-sight lost: Shew me a Mistresse that is passing faire, What doth her beauty serue but as a note, Where I may read who past that passing faire. Farewell thou can'st not teach me to forget, Ile pay that doctrine, or else die in debt. Mountague is bound as well as I, In penalty alike, and 'tis not hard I thinke, For men so old as wee, to keepe the peace Of Honourable reckoning are you both, And pittie 'tis you liu'd at ods so long: But now my Lord, what say you to my sute? But saying ore what I haue said before, My Child is yet a stranger in the world, Shee hath not seene the change of fourteene yeares, Let two more Summers wither in their pride, Ere we may thinke her ripe to be a Bride Younger then she, are happy mothers made And too soone mar'd are those so early made: Earth hath swallowed all my hopes but she, Shee's the hopefull Lady of my earth: But wooe her gentle Paris, get her heart, My will to her consent, is but a part, And shee agree, within her scope of choise, Lyes my consent, and faire according voice: This night I hold an old accustom'd Feast, Whereto I haue inuited many a Guest, Such as I loue, and you among the store, One more, most welcome makes my number more: At my poore house, looke to behold this night, Earth-treading starres, that make darke heauen light, Such comfort as do lusty young men feele, When well apparrel'd Aprill on the heele Of limping Winter treads, euen such delight Among fresh Fennell buds shall you this night Inherit at my house: heare all, all see: And like her most, whose merit most shall be: Which one more veiw, of many, mine being one, May stand in number, though in reckning none. Come, goe with me: goe sirrah trudge about, Through faire Verona, find those persons out, Whose names are written there, and to them say, My house and welcome, on their pleasure stay. Find them out whose names are written. Heere it is written, that the Shoo-maker should meddle with his Yard, and the Tayler with his Last, the Fisher with his Pensill, and the Painter with his Nets. But I am sent to find those persons whose names are writ, & can neuer find what names the writing person hath here writ (I must to the learned) in good time. Tut man, one fire burnes out anothers burning, One paine is lesned by anothers anguish: Turne giddie, and be holpe by backward turning: One desparate greefe, cures with anothers languish: Take thou some new infection to the eye, And the rank poyson of the old wil die Your Plantan leafe is excellent for that For what I pray thee? For your broken shin Why Romeo art thou mad? Not mad, but bound more then a mad man is: Shut vp in prison, kept without my foode, Whipt and tormented: and Godden good fellow, Godgigoden, I pray sir can you read? I mine owne fortune in my miserie Perhaps you haue learn'd it without booke: But I pray can you read any thing you see? I, if I know the Letters and the Language Ye say honestly, rest you merry Stay fellow, I can read. He reades the Letter. Seigneur Martino, and his wife and daughter: County Anselme and his beautious sisters: the Lady widdow of Vtruuio, Seigneur Placentio, and his louely Neeces: Mercutio and his brother Valentine: mine vncle Capulet his wife and daughters: my faire Neece Rosaline, Liuia, Seigneur Valentio, & his Cosen Tybalt: Lucio and the liuely Helena. A faire assembly, whither should they come? Vp Whither? to supper? To our house Whose house? My Maisters Indeed I should haue askt you that before Now Ile tell you without asking. My maister is the great rich Capulet, and if you be not of the house of Mountagues I pray come and crush a cup of wine. Rest you merry. At this same auncient Feast of Capulets Sups the faire Rosaline, whom thou so loues: With all the admired Beauties of Verona, Go thither and with vnattainted eye, Compare her face with some that I shall show, And I will make thee thinke thy Swan a Crow When the deuout religion of mine eye Maintaines such falshood, then turne teares to fire: And these who often drown'd could neuer die, Transparent Heretiques be burnt for liers. One fairer then my loue: the all-seeing Sun Nere saw her match, since first the world begun Tut, you saw her faire, none else being by, Herselfe poys'd with herselfe in either eye: But in that Christall scales, let there be waid, Your Ladies loue against some other Maid That I will show you, shining at this Feast, And she shew scant shell, well, that now shewes best Ile goe along, no such sight to be showne, But to reioyce in splendor of mine owne. Nurse wher's my daughter? call her forth to me Now by my Maidenhead, at twelue yeare old I bad her come, what Lamb: what Ladi-bird, God forbid, Where's this Girle? what Iuliet? How now, who calls? Your Mother Madam I am heere, what is your will? This is the matter: Nurse giue me leaue awhile, we must talke in secret. Nurse come backe againe, I haue remembred me, thou'se heare our counsell. Thou knowest my daughter's of a prety age Faith I can tell her age vnto an houre Shee's not fourteene Ile lay fourteene of my teeth, And yet to my teene be it spoken, I haue but foure, shee's not fourteene. How long is it now to Lammas tide? A fortnight and odde dayes Euen or odde, of all daies in the yeare come Lammas Eue at night shall she be fourteene. Susan & she, God rest all Christian soules, were of an age. Well Susan is with God, she was too good for me. But as I said, on Lamas Eue at night shall she be fourteene, that shall she marie, I remember it well. 'Tis since the Earth-quake now eleuen yeares, and she was wean'd I neuer shall forget it, of all the daies of the yeare, vpon that day: for I had then laid Worme-wood to my Dug sitting in the Sunne vnder the Douehouse wall, my Lord and you were then at Mantua, nay I doe beare a braine. But as I said, when it did tast the Worme-wood on the nipple of my Dugge, and felt it bitter, pretty foole, to see it teachie, and fall out with the Dugge, Shake quoth the Doue-house, 'twas no neede I trow to bid mee trudge, and since that time it is a eleuen yeares, for then she could stand alone, nay bi'th' roode she could haue runne, & wadled all about: for euen the day before she broke her brow, & then my Husband God be with his soule, a was a merrie man, tooke vp the Child, yea quoth hee, doest thou fall vpon thy face? thou wilt fall backeward when thou hast more wit, wilt thou not Iule? And by my holy-dam, the pretty wretch lefte crying, & said I: to see now how a Iest shall come about. I warrant, & I shall liue a thousand yeares, I neuer should forget it: wilt thou not Iule quoth he? and pretty foole it stinted, and said I Old La. Inough of this, I pray thee hold thy peace Yes Madam, yet I cannot chuse but laugh, to thinke it should leaue crying, & say I: and yet I warrant it had vpon it brow, a bumpe as big as a young Cockrels stone? A perilous knock, and it cryed bitterly. Yea quoth my husband, fall'st vpon thy face, thou wilt fall backward when thou commest to age: wilt thou not Iule? It stinted: and said I And stint thou too, I pray thee Nurse, say I Peace I haue done: God marke thee too his grace thou wast the prettiest Babe that ere I nurst, and I might liue to see thee married once, I haue my wish Old La. Marry that marry is the very theame I came to talke of, tell me daughter Iuliet, How stands your disposition to be Married? It is an houre that I dreame not of An houre, were I not thine onely Nurse, I would say thou had'st suckt wisedome from thy teat Old La. Well thinke of marriage now, yonger then you Heere in Verona, Ladies of esteeme, Are made already Mothers. By my count I was your Mother, much vpon these yeares That you are now a Maide, thus then in briefe: The valiant Paris seekes you for his loue A man young Lady, Lady, such a man as all the world. Why hee's a man of waxe Old La. Veronas Summer hath not such a flower Nay hee's a flower, infaith a very flower Old La. What say you, can you loue the Gentleman? This night you shall behold him at our Feast, Read ore the volume of young Paris face, And find delight, writ there with Beauties pen: Examine euery seuerall liniament, And see how one another lends content: And what obscur'd in this faire volume lies, Find written in the Margent of his eyes. This precious Booke of Loue, this vnbound Louer, To Beautifie him, onely lacks a Couer. The fish liues in the Sea, and 'tis much pride For faire without, the faire within to hide: That Booke in manies eyes doth share the glorie, That in Gold claspes, Lockes in the Golden storie: So shall you share all that he doth possesse, By hauing him, making your selfe no lesse No lesse, nay bigger: women grow by men Old La. Speake briefly, can you like of Paris loue? Ile looke to like, if looking liking moue. But no more deepe will I endart mine eye, Then your consent giues strength to make flye. Madam, the guests are come, supper seru'd vp, you cal'd, my young Lady askt for, the Nurse cur'st in the Pantery, and euery thing in extremitie: I must hence to wait, I beseech you follow straight. We follow thee, Iuliet, the Countie staies Goe Gyrle, seeke happie nights to happy daies. Torch-bearers. What shall this spech be spoke for our excuse? Or shall we on without Apologie? The date is out of such prolixitie, Weele haue no Cupid, hood winkt with a skarfe, Bearing a Tartars painted Bow of lath, Skaring the Ladies like a Crow-keeper. But let them measure vs by what they will, Weele measure them with a Measure, and be gone Giue me a Torch, I am not for this ambling. Being but heauy I will beare the light Nay gentle Romeo, we must haue you dance Not I beleeue me, you haue dancing shooes With nimble soles, I haue a soale of Lead So stakes me to the ground, I cannot moue You are a Louer, borrow Cupids wings, And soare with them aboue a common bound I am too sore enpearced with his shaft, To soare with his light feathers, and to bound: I cannot bound a pitch aboue dull woe, Vnder loues heauy burthen doe I sinke And to sinke in it should you burthen loue, Too great oppression for a tender thing Is loue a tender thing? it is too rough, Too rude, too boysterous, and it pricks like thorne If loue be rough with you, be rough with loue, Pricke loue for pricking, and you beat loue downe, Giue me a Case to put my visage in, A Visor for a Visor, what care I What curious eye doth quote deformities: Here are the Beetle-browes shall blush for me Come knocke and enter, and no sooner in, But euery man betake him to his legs A Torch for me, let wantons light of heart Tickle the sencelesse rushes with their heeles: For I am prouerb'd with a Grandsier Phrase, Ile be a Candle-holder and looke on, The game was nere so faire, and I am done Tut, duns the Mouse, the Constables owne word, If thou art dun, weele draw thee from the mire. Or saue your reuerence loue, wherein thou stickest Vp to the eares, come we burne day-light ho Nay that's not so I meane sir I delay, We wast our lights in vaine, lights, lights, by day; Take our good meaning, for our Iudgement sits Fiue times in that, ere once in our fiue wits And we meane well in going to this Maske, But 'tis no wit to go Why may one aske? I dreampt a dreame to night And so did I Well what was yours? That dreamers often lye In bed a sleepe while they do dreame things true O then I see Queene Mab hath beene with you: She is the Fairies Midwife, & she comes in shape no bigger then Agat-stone, on the fore-finger of an Alderman, drawne with a teeme of little Atomies, ouer mens noses as they lie asleepe: her Waggon Spokes made of long Spinners legs: the Couer of the wings of Grashoppers, her Traces of the smallest Spiders web, her coullers of the Moonshines watry Beames, her Whip of Crickets bone, the Lash of Philome, her Waggoner, a small gray-coated Gnat, not halfe so bigge as a round little Worme, prickt from the Lazie-finger of a man. Her Chariot is an emptie Haselnut, made by the Ioyner Squirrel or old Grub, time out a mind, the Faries Coach-makers: & in this state she gallops night by night, through Louers braines: and then they dreame of Loue. On Courtiers knees, that dreame on Cursies strait: ore Lawyers fingers, who strait dreampt on Fees, ore Ladies lips, who strait on kisses dreame, which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues, because their breath with Sweet meats tainted are. Sometime she gallops ore a Courtiers nose, & then dreames he of smelling out a sute: & somtime comes she with Tith pigs tale, tickling a Parsons nose as a lies asleepe, then he dreames of another Benefice. Sometime she driueth ore a Souldiers necke, & then dreames he of cutting Forraine throats, of Breaches, Ambuscados, Spanish Blades: Of Healths fiue Fadome deepe, and then anon drums in his eares, at which he startes and wakes; and being thus frighted, sweares a prayer or two & sleepes againe: this is that very Mab that plats the manes of Horses in the night: & bakes the Elklocks in foule sluttish haires, which once vntangled, much misfortune bodes, This is the hag, when Maides lie on their backs, That presses them, and learnes them first to beare, Making them women of good carriage: This is she Peace, peace, Mercutio peace, Thou talk'st of nothing True, I talke of dreames: Which are the children of an idle braine, Begot of nothing, but vaine phantasie, Which is as thin of substance as the ayre, And more inconstant then the wind, who wooes Euen now the frozen bosome of the North: And being anger'd, puffes away from thence, Turning his side to the dew dropping South This wind you talke of blowes vs from our selues, Supper is done, and we shall come too late I feare too early, for my mind misgiues, Some consequence yet hanging in the starres, Shall bitterly begin his fearefull date With this nights reuels, and expire the tearme Of a despised life clos'd in my brest: By some vile forfeit of vntimely death. But he that hath the stirrage of my course, Direct my sute: on lustie Gentlemen Strike Drum. They march about the Stage, and Seruingmen come forth with their napkins. Where's Potpan, that he helpes not to take away? He shift a Trencher? he scrape a Trencher? 1. When good manners, shall lie in one or two mens hands, and they vnwasht too, 'tis a foule thing Away with the Ioynstooles, remoue the Courtcubbord, looke to the Plate: good thou, saue mee a piece of Marchpane, and as thou louest me, let the Porter let in Susan Grindstone, and Nell, Anthonie and Potpan 2. I Boy readie You are lookt for, and cal'd for, askt for, & sought for, in the great Chamber 1. We cannot be here and there too, chearly Boyes, Be brisk awhile, and the longer liuer take all. 1. Capu. Welcome Gentlemen, Ladies that haue their toes Vnplagu'd with Cornes, will walke about with you: Ah my Mistresses, which of you all Will now deny to dance? She that makes dainty, She Ile sweare hath Cornes: am I come neare ye now? Welcome Gentlemen, I haue seene the day That I haue worne a Visor, and could tell A whispering tale in a faire Ladies eare: Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone, You are welcome Gentlemen, come Musitians play: Musicke plaies: and they dance. A Hall, Hall, giue roome, and foote it Girles, More light you knaues, and turne the Tables vp: And quench the fire, the Roome is growne too hot. Ah sirrah, this vnlookt for sport comes well: Nay sit, nay sit, good Cozin Capulet, For you and I are past our dauncing daies: How long 'ist now since last your selfe and I Were in a Maske? 2. Capu. Berlady thirty yeares 1. Capu. What man: 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much, 'Tis since the Nuptiall of Lucentio, Come Pentycost as quickely as it will, Some fiue and twenty yeares, and then we Maskt 2. Cap. 'Tis more, 'tis more, his Sonne is elder sir: His Sonne is thirty 3. Cap. Will you tell me that? His Sonne was but a Ward two yeares agoe What Ladie is that which doth inrich the hand Of yonder Knight? I know not sir O she doth teach the Torches to burne bright: It seemes she hangs vpon the cheeke of night, As a rich Iewel in an aethiops eare: Beauty too rich for vse, for earth too deare: So shewes a Snowy Doue trooping with Crowes, As yonder Lady ore her fellowes showes; The measure done, Ile watch her place of stand, And touching hers, make blessed my rude hand. Did my heart loue till now, forsweare it sight, For I neuer saw true Beauty till this night This by his voice, should be a Mountague. Fetch me my Rapier Boy, what dares the slaue Come hither couer'd with an antique face, To fleere and scorne at our Solemnitie? Now by the stocke and Honour of my kin, To strike him dead I hold it not a sin Why how now kinsman, Wherefore storme you so? Vncle this is a Mountague, our foe: A Villaine that is hither come in spight, To scorne at our Solemnitie this night Young Romeo is it? 'Tis he, that Villaine Romeo Content thee gentle Coz, let him alone, A beares him like a portly Gentleman: And to say truth, Verona brags of him, To be a vertuous and well gouern'd youth: I would not for the wealth of all the towne, Here in my house do him disparagement: Therfore be patient, take no note of him, It is my will, the which if thou respect, Shew a faire presence, and put off these frownes, An ill beseeming semblance for a Feast It fits when such a Villaine is a guest, Ile not endure him He shall be endur'd. What goodman boy, I say he shall, go too, Am I the Maister here or you? go too, Youle not endure him, God shall mend my soule, Youle make a Mutinie among the Guests: You will set cocke a hoope, youle be the man Why Vncle, 'tis a shame Go too, go too, You are a sawcy Boy, 'ist so indeed? This tricke may chance to scath you, I know what, You must contrary me, marry 'tis time. Well said my hearts, you are a Princox, goe, Be quiet, or more light, more light for shame, Ile make you quiet. What, chearely my hearts Patience perforce, with wilfull choler meeting, Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting: I will withdraw, but this intrusion shall Now seeming sweet, conuert to bitter gall. If I prophane with my vnworthiest hand, This holy shrine, the gentle sin is this, My lips to blushing Pilgrims did ready stand, To smooth that rough touch, with a tender kisse Good Pilgrime, You do wrong your hand too much. Which mannerly deuotion shewes in this, For Saints haue hands, that Pilgrims hands do tuch, And palme to palme, is holy Palmers kisse Haue not Saints lips, and holy Palmers too? I Pilgrim, lips that they must vse in prayer O then deare Saint, let lips do what hands do, They pray (grant thou) least faith turne to dispaire Saints do not moue, Though grant for prayers sake Then moue not while my prayers effect I take: Thus from my lips, by thine my sin is purg'd Then haue my lips the sin that they haue tooke Sin from my lips? O trespasse sweetly vrg'd: Giue me my sin againe You kisse by'th' booke Madam your Mother craues a word with you What is her Mother? Marrie Batcheler, Her Mother is the Lady of the house, And a good Lady, and a wise, and Vertuous, I Nur'st her Daughter that you talkt withall: I tell you, he that can lay hold of her, Shall haue the chincks Is she a Capulet? O deare account! My life is my foes debt Away, be gone, the sport is at the best I so I feare, the more is my vnrest Nay Gentlemen prepare not to be gone, We haue a trifling foolish Banquet towards: Is it e'ne so? why then I thanke you all. I thanke you honest Gentlemen, good night: More Torches here: come on, then let's to bed. Ah sirrah, by my faie it waxes late, Ile to my rest Come hither Nurse, What is yond Gentleman: The Sonne and Heire of old Tyberio What's he that now is going out of doore? Marrie that I thinke be young Petruchio What's he that follows here that would not dance? I know not Go aske his name: if he be married, My graue is like to be my wedded bed His name is Romeo, and a Mountague, The onely Sonne of your great Enemie My onely Loue sprung from my onely hate, Too early seene, vnknowne, and knowne too late, Prodigious birth of Loue it is to me, That I must loue a loathed Enemie What's this? whats this? A rime, I learne euen now Of one I dan'st withall. One cals within, Iuliet. Anon, anon: Come let's away, the strangers all are gone. Now old desire doth in his death bed lie, And yong affection gapes to be his Heire, That faire, for which Loue gron'd for and would die, With tender Iuliet matcht, is now not faire. Now Romeo is beloued, and Loues againe, A like bewitched by the charme of lookes: But to his foe suppos'd he must complaine, And she steale Loues sweet bait from fearefull hookes: Being held a foe, he may not haue accesse To breath such vowes as Louers vse to sweare, And she as much in Loue, her meanes much lesse, To meete her new Beloued any where: But passion lends them Power, time, meanes to meete, Temp'ring extremities with extreame sweete. Can I goe forward when my heart is here? Turne backe dull earth, and find thy Center out. Romeo, my Cozen Romeo, Romeo He is wise, And on my life hath stolne him home to bed He ran this way and leapt this Orchard wall. Call good Mercutio: Nay, Ile coniure too Romeo, Humours, Madman, Passion, Louer, Appeare thou in the likenesse of a sigh, Speake but one time, and I am satisfied: Cry me but ay me, Prouant, but Loue and day, Speake to my goship Venus one faire word, One Nickname for her purblind Sonne and her, Young Abraham Cupid he that shot so true, When King Cophetua lou'd the begger Maid, He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moueth not, The Ape is dead, I must coniure him, I coniure thee by Rosalines bright eyes, By her High forehead, and her Scarlet lip, By her Fine foote, Straight leg, and Quiuering thigh, And the Demeanes, that there Adiacent lie, That in thy likenesse thou appeare to vs And if he heare thee thou wilt anger him This cannot anger him, t'would anger him To raise a spirit in his Mistresse circle, Of some strange nature, letting it stand Till she had laid it, and coniured it downe, That were some spight. My inuocation is faire and honest, & in his Mistris name, I coniure onely but to raise vp him Come, he hath hid himselfe among these Trees To be consorted with the Humerous night: Blind is his Loue, and best befits the darke If Loue be blind, Loue cannot hit the marke, Now will he sit vnder a Medler tree, And wish his Mistresse were that kind of Fruite, As Maides cal Medlers when they laugh alone, O Romeo that she were, O that she were An open, or thou a Poprin Peare, Romeo goodnight, Ile to my Truckle bed, This Field-bed is to cold for me to sleepe, Come shall we go? Go then, for 'tis in vaine to seeke him here That meanes not to be found. He ieasts at Scarres that neuer felt a wound, But soft, what light through yonder window breaks? It is the East, and Iuliet is the Sunne, Arise faire Sun and kill the enuious Moone, Who is already sicke and pale with griefe, That thou her Maid art far more faire then she: Be not her Maid since she is enuious, Her Vestal liuery is but sicke and greene, And none but fooles do weare it, cast it off: It is my Lady, O it is my Loue, O that she knew she were, She speakes, yet she sayes nothing, what of that? Her eye discourses, I will answere it: I am too bold 'tis not to me she speakes: Two of the fairest starres in all the Heauen, Hauing some businesse do entreat her eyes, To twinckle in their Spheres till they returne. What if her eyes were there, they in her head, The brightnesse of her cheeke would shame those starres, As day-light doth a Lampe, her eye in heauen, Would through the ayrie Region streame so bright, That Birds would sing, and thinke it were not night: See how she leanes her cheeke vpon her hand. O that I were a Gloue vpon that hand, That I might touch that cheeke Ay me She speakes. Oh speake againe bright Angell, for thou art As glorious to this night being ore my head, As is a winged messenger of heauen Vnto the white vpturned wondring eyes Of mortalls that fall backe to gaze on him, When he bestrides the lazie puffing Cloudes, And sailes vpon the bosome of the ayre O Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo? Denie thy Father and refuse thy name: Or if thou wilt not, be but sworne to my Loue, And Ile no longer be a Capulet Shall I heare more, or shall I speake at this? 'Tis but thy name that is my Enemy: Thou art thy selfe, though not a Mountague, What's Mountague? it is nor hand nor foote, Nor arme, nor face, O be some other name Belonging to a man. What? in a names that which we call a Rose, By any other word would smell as sweete, So Romeo would, were he not Romeo cal'd, Retaine that deare perfection which he owes, Without that title Romeo, doffe thy name, And for thy name which is no part of thee, Take all my selfe I take thee at thy word: Call me but Loue, and Ile be new baptiz'd, Hence foorth I neuer will be Romeo What man art thou, that thus bescreen'd in night So stumblest on my counsell? By a name, I know not how to tell thee who I am: My name deare Saint, is hatefull to my selfe, Because it is an Enemy to thee, Had I it written, I would teare the word My eares haue yet not drunke a hundred words Of thy tongues vttering, yet I know the sound. Art thou not Romeo, and a Montague? Neither faire Maid, if either thee dislike How cam'st thou hither. Tell me, and wherefore? The Orchard walls are high, and hard to climbe, And the place death, considering who thou art, If any of my kinsmen find thee here, With Loues light wings Did I ore-perch these Walls, For stony limits cannot hold Loue out, And what Loue can do, that dares Loue attempt: Therefore thy kinsmen are no stop to me If they do see thee, they will murther thee Alacke there lies more perill in thine eye, Then twenty of their Swords, looke thou but sweete, And I am proofe against their enmity I would not for the world they saw thee here I haue nights cloake to hide me from their eyes And but thou loue me, let them finde me here, My life were better ended by their hate, Then death proroged wanting of thy Loue By whose direction found'st thou out this place? By Loue that first did prompt me to enquire, He lent me counsell, and I lent him eyes, I am no Pylot, yet wert thou as far As that vast-shore-washet with the farthest Sea, I should aduenture for such Marchandise Thou knowest the maske of night is on my face, Else would a Maiden blush bepaint my cheeke, For that which thou hast heard me speake to night, Faine would I dwell on forme, faine, faine, denie What I haue spoke, but farewell Complement, Doest thou Loue? I know thou wilt say I, And I will take thy word, yet if thou swear'st, Thou maiest proue false: at Louers periuries They say Ioue laught, oh gentle Romeo, If thou dost Loue, pronounce it faithfully: Or if thou thinkest I am too quickly wonne, Ile frowne and be peruerse, and say thee nay, So thou wilt wooe: But else not for the world. In truth faire Mountague I am too fond: And therefore thou maiest thinke my behauiour light, But trust me Gentleman, Ile proue more true, Then those that haue coying to be strange, I should haue beene more strange, I must confesse, But that thou ouer heard'st ere I was ware My true Loues passion, therefore pardon me, And not impute this yeelding to light Loue, Which the darke night hath so discouered Lady, by yonder Moone I vow, That tips with siluer all these Fruite tree tops O sweare not by the Moone, th' inconstant Moone, That monethly changes in her circled Orbe, Least that thy Loue proue likewise variable What shall I sweare by? Do not sweare at all: Or if thou wilt sweare by thy gratious selfe, Which is the God of my Idolatry, And Ile beleeue thee If my hearts deare loue Well do not sweare, although I ioy in thee: I haue no ioy of this contract to night, It is too rash, too vnaduis'd, too sudden, Too like the lightning which doth cease to be Ere, one can say, it lightens, Sweete good night: This bud of Loue by Summers ripening breath, May proue a beautious Flower when next we meete: Goodnight, goodnight, as sweete repose and rest, Come to thy heart, as that within my brest O wilt thou leaue me so vnsatisfied? What satisfaction can'st thou haue to night? Th' exchange of thy Loues faithfull vow for mine I gaue thee mine before thou did'st request it: And yet I would it were to giue againe Would'st thou withdraw it, For what purpose Loue? But to be franke and giue it thee againe, And yet I wish but for the thing I haue, My bounty is as boundlesse as the Sea, My Loue as deepe, the more I giue to thee The more I haue, for both are Infinite: I heare some noyse within deare Loue adue: Cals within. Anon good Nurse, sweet Mountague be true: Stay but a little, I will come againe O blessed blessed night, I am afear'd Being in night, all this is but a dreame, Too flattering sweet to be substantiall Three words deare Romeo, And goodnight indeed, If that thy bent of Loue be Honourable, Thy purpose marriage, send me word to morrow, By one that Ile procure to come to thee, Where and what time thou wilt performe the right, And all my Fortunes at thy foote Ile lay, And follow thee my Lord throughout the world I come, anon: but if thou meanest not well, I do beseech thee (By and by I come) To cease thy strife, and leaue me to my griefe, To morrow will I send So thriue my soule A thousand times goodnight. A thousand times the worse to want thy light, Loue goes toward Loue as school-boyes fro their books But Loue fro Loue, towards schoole with heauie lookes. Hist Romeo hist: O for a Falkners voice, To lure this Tassell gentle backe againe, Bondage is hoarse, and may not speake aloud, Else would I teare the Caue where Eccho lies, And make her ayrie tongue more hoarse, then With repetition of my Romeo It is my soule that calls vpon my name. How siluer sweet, sound Louers tongues by night, Like softest Musicke to attending eares Romeo My Neece What a clock to morrow Shall I send to thee? By the houre of nine I will not faile, 'tis twenty yeares till then, I haue forgot why I did call thee backe Let me stand here till thou remember it I shall forget, to haue thee still stand there, Remembring how I Loue thy company And Ile still stay, to haue thee still forget, Forgetting any other home but this 'Tis almost morning, I would haue thee gone, And yet no further then a wantons Bird, That let's it hop a little from his hand, Like a poore prisoner in his twisted Gyues, And with a silken thred plucks it backe againe, So louing Iealous of his liberty I would I were thy Bird Sweet so would I, Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing: Good night, good night Parting is such sweete sorrow, That I shall say goodnight, till it be morrow Sleepe dwell vpon thine eyes, peace in thy brest Would I were sleepe and peace so sweet to rest, The gray ey'd morne smiles on the frowning night, Checkring the Easterne Clouds with streakes of light, And darkenesse fleckel'd like a drunkard reeles, From forth dayes pathway, made by Titans wheeles. Hence will I to my ghostly Friers close Cell, His helpe to craue, and my deare hap to tell. The gray ey'd morne smiles on the frowning night, Checkring the Easterne Cloudes with streaks of light: And fleckled darknesse like a drunkard reeles, From forth daies path, and Titans burning wheeles: Now ere the Sun aduance his burning eye, The day to cheere, and nights danke dew to dry, I must vpfill this Osier Cage of ours, With balefull weedes, and precious Iuiced flowers, The earth that's Natures mother, is her Tombe, What is her burying graue that is her wombe: And from her wombe children of diuers kind We sucking on her naturall bosome find: Many for many vertues excellent: None but for some, and yet all different. O mickle is the powerfull grace that lies In Plants, Hearbs, stones, and their true qualities: For nought so vile, that on earth doth liue, But to the earth some speciall good doth giue. Nor ought so good, but strain'd from that faire vse, Reuolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse. Vertue it selfe turnes vice being misapplied, And vice sometime by action dignified. Poyson hath residence, and medicine power: For this being smelt, with that part cheares each part, Being tasted stayes all sences with the heart. Two such opposed Kings encampe them still, In man as well as Hearbes, grace and rude will: And where the worser is predominant, Full soone the Canker death eates vp that Plant Good morrow Father Benedecite. What early tongue so sweet saluteth me? Young Sonne, it argues a distempered head, So soone to bid goodmorrow to thy bed; Care keepes his watch in euery old mans eye, And where Care lodges, sleepe will neuer lye: But where vnbrused youth with vnstuft braine Doth couch his lims, there, golden sleepe doth raigne; Therefore thy earlinesse doth me assure, Thou art vprous'd with some distemprature; Or if not so, then here I hit it right. Our Romeo hath not beene in bed to night That last is true, the sweeter rest was mine God pardon sin: wast thou with Rosaline? With Rosaline, my ghostly Father? No, I haue forgot that name, and that names woe That's my good Son, but wher hast thou bin then? Ile tell thee ere thou aske it me agen: I haue beene feasting with mine enemie, Where on a sudden one hath wounded me, That's by me wounded: both our remedies I beare no hatred, blessed man: for loe My intercession likewise steads my foe Be plaine good Son, rest homely in thy drift, Ridling confession, findes but ridling shrift Then plainly know my hearts deare Loue is set, On the faire daughter of rich Capulet: As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine; And all combin'd, saue what thou must combine By holy marriage: when and where, and how, We met, we wooed, and made exchange of vow: Ile tell thee as we passe, but this I pray, That thou consent to marrie vs to day Holy S. Francis, what a change is heere? Is Rosaline that thou didst Loue so deare So soone forsaken? young mens Loue then lies Not truely in their hearts, but in their eyes. Iesu Maria, what a deale of brine Hath washt thy sallow cheekes for Rosaline? How much salt water throwne away in wast, To season Loue that of it doth not tast. The Sun not yet thy sighes, from heauen cleares, Thy old grones yet ringing in my auncient eares: Lo here vpon thy cheeke the staine doth sit, Of an old teare that is not washt off yet. If ere thou wast thy selfe, and these woes thine, Thou and these woes, were all for Rosaline. And art thou chang'd? pronounce this sentence then, Women may fall, when there's no strength in men Thou chid'st me oft for louing Rosaline For doting, not for louing pupill mine And bad'st me bury Loue Not in a graue, To lay one in, another out to haue I pray thee chide me not, her I Loue now Doth grace for grace, and Loue for Loue allow: The other did not so O she knew well, Thy Loue did read by rote, that could not spell: But come young wauerer, come goe with me, In one respect, Ile thy assistant be: For this alliance may so happy proue, To turne your houshould rancor to pure Loue O let vs hence, I stand on sudden hast Wisely and slow, they stumble that run fast. Where the deule should this Romeo be? came he not home to night? Not to his Fathers, I spoke with his man Why that same pale hard-harted wench, that Rosaline torments him so, that he will sure run mad Tibalt, the kinsman to old Capulet, hath sent a Letter to his Fathers house A challenge on my life Romeo will answere it Any man that can write, may answere a Letter Nay, he will answere the Letters Maister how he dares, being dared Alas poore Romeo, he is already dead stab'd with a white wenches blacke eye, runne through the eare with a Loue song, the very pinne of his heart, cleft with the blind Bowe-boyes but-shaft, and is he a man to encounter Tybalt? Why what is Tibalt? More then Prince of Cats. Oh hee's the Couragious Captaine of Complements: he fights as you sing pricksong, keeps time, distance, and proportion, he rests his minum, one, two, and the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a Dualist, a Dualist: a Gentleman of the very first house of the first and second cause: ah the immortall Passado, the Punto reuerso, the Hay The what? The Pox of such antique lisping affecting phantacies, these new tuners of accent: Iesu a very good blade, a very tall man, a very good whore. Why is not this a lamentable thing Grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with these strange flies: these fashion Mongers, these pardon-mee's, who stand so much on the new form, that they cannot sit at ease on the old bench. O their bones, their bones. Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo Without his Roe, like a dryed Hering. O flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified? Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his Lady, was a kitchen wench, marrie she had a better Loue to berime her: Dido a dowdie, Cleopatra a Gipsie, Hellen and Hero, hildings and Harlots: Thisbie a gray eie or so, but not to the purpose. Signior Romeo, Bon iour, there's a French salutation to your French slop: you gaue vs the counterfait fairely last night Good morrow to you both, what counterfeit did I giue you? The slip sir, the slip, can you not conceiue? Pardon Mercutio, my businesse was great, and in such a case as mine, a man may straine curtesie That's as much as to say, such a case as yours constrains a man to bow in the hams Meaning to cursie Thou hast most kindly hit it A most curteous exposition Nay, I am the very pinck of curtesie Pinke for flower Right Why then is my Pump well flowr'd Sure wit, follow me this ieast, now till thou hast worne out thy Pump, that when the single sole of it is worne, the ieast may remaine after the wearing, sole-singular O single sol'd ieast, Soly singular for the singlenesse Come betweene vs good Benuolio, my wits faints Swits and spurs, Swits and spurs, or Ile crie a match Nay, if our wits run the Wild-Goose chase, I am done: For thou hast more of the Wild-Goose in one of thy wits, then I am sure I haue in my whole fiue. Was I with you there for the Goose? Thou wast neuer with mee for any thing, when thou wast not there for the Goose I will bite thee by the eare for that iest Nay, good Goose bite not Thy wit is a very Bitter-sweeting, It is a most sharpe sawce And is it not well seru'd into a Sweet-Goose? Oh here's a wit of Cheuerell, that stretches from an ynch narrow, to an ell broad I stretch it out for that word, broad, which added to the Goose, proues thee farre and wide, abroad Goose Why is not this better now, then groning for Loue, now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo: now art thou what thou art, by Art as well as by Nature, for this driueling Loue is like a great Naturall, that runs lolling vp and downe to hid his bable in a hole Stop there, stop there Thou desir'st me to stop in my tale against the haire Thou would'st else haue made thy tale large O thou art deceiu'd, I would haue made it short, or I was come to the whole depth of my tale, and meant indeed to occupie the argument no longer. Here's a goodly geare. A sayle, a sayle Two, two: a Shirt and a Smocke Peter? Anon My Fan Peter? Good Peter to hide her face? For her Fans the fairer face? God ye good morrow Gentlemen God ye gooden faire Gentlewoman Is it gooden? 'Tis no lesse I tell you: for the bawdy hand of the Dyall is now vpon the pricke of Noone Out vpon you: what a man are you? One Gentlewoman, That God hath made, himselfe to mar By my troth it is said, for himselfe to, mar quatha: Gentlemen, can any of you tel me where I may find the young Romeo? I can tell you: but young Romeo will be older when you haue found him, then he was when you sought him: I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse You say well Yea is the worst well, Very well tooke: Ifaith, wisely, wisely If you be he sir, I desire some confidence with you? She will endite him to some Supper A baud, a baud, a baud. So ho What hast thou found? No Hare sir, vnlesse a Hare sir in a Lenten pie, that is something stale and hoare ere it be spent. An old Hare hoare, and an old Hare hoare is very good meat in Lent. But a Hare that is hoare is too much for a score, when it hoares ere it be spent, Romeo will you come to your Fathers? Weele to dinner thither I will follow you Farewell auncient Lady: Farewell Lady, Lady, Lady. I pray you sir, what sawcie Merchant was this that was so full of his roperie? A Gentleman Nurse, that loues to heare himselfe talke, and will speake more in a minute, then he will stand to in a Moneth And a speake any thing against me, Ile take him downe, z a were lustier then he is, and twentie such Iacks: and if I cannot, Ile finde those that shall: scuruie knaue, I am none of his flurt-gils, I am none of his skaines mates, and thou must stand by too and suffer euery knaue to vse me at his pleasure I saw no man vse you at his pleasure: if I had, my weapon should quickly haue beene out, I warrant you, I dare draw assoone as another man, if I see occasion in a good quarrell, and the law on my side Now afore God, I am so vext, that euery part about me quiuers, skuruy knaue: pray you sir a word: and as I told you, my young Lady bid me enquire you out, what she bid me say, I will keepe to my selfe: but first let me tell ye, if ye should leade her in a fooles paradise, as they say, it were a very grosse kind of behauiour, as they say: for the Gentlewoman is yong: & therefore, if you should deale double with her, truely it were an ill thing to be offered to any Gentlewoman, and very weake dealing Nurse commend me to thy Lady and Mistresse, I protest vnto thee Good heart, and yfaith I will tell her as much: Lord, Lord she will be a ioyfull woman What wilt thou tell her Nurse? thou doest not marke me? I will tell her sir, that you do protest, which as I take it, is a Gentleman-like offer Bid her deuise some meanes to come to shrift this afternoone, And there she shall at Frier Lawrence Cell Be shriu'd and married: here is for thy paines No truly sir not a penny Go too, I say you shall This afternoone sir? well she shall be there And stay thou good Nurse behind the Abbey wall, And bring thee Cords made like a tackled staire, Which to the high top gallant of my ioy, Must be my conuoy in the secret night. Farewell, be trustie and Ile quite thy paines: Farewell, commend me to thy Mistresse Now God in heauen blesse thee: harke you sir, What saist thou my deare Nurse? Is your man secret, did you nere heare say two may keepe counsell putting one away Warrant thee my man is true as steele Well sir, my Mistresse is the sweetest Lady, Lord, Lord, when 'twas a little prating thing. O there is a Noble man in Towne one Paris, that would faine lay knife aboard: but she good soule had as leeue see a Toade, a very Toade as see him: I anger her sometimes, and tell her that Paris is the properer man, but Ile warrant you, when I say so, shee lookes as pale as any clout in the versall world. Doth not Rosemarie and Romeo begin both with a letter? I Nurse, what of that? Both with an R A mocker that's the dogs name. R. is for the no, I know it begins with some other letter, and she hath the prettiest sententious of it, of you and Rosemary, that it would do you good to heare it Commend me to thy Lady I a thousand times. Peter? Anon Before and apace. The clocke strook nine, when I did send the Nurse, In halfe an houre she promised to returne, Perchance she cannot meete him: that's not so: Oh she is lame, Loues Herauld should be thoughts, Which ten times faster glides then the Sunnes beames, Driuing backe shadowes ouer lowring hils. Therefore do nimble Pinion'd Doues draw Loue, And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings: Now is the Sun vpon the highmost hill Of this daies iourney, and from nine till twelue, Is three long houres, yet she is not come. Had she affections and warme youthfull blood, She would be as swift in motion as a ball, My words would bandy her to my sweete Loue, And his to me, but old folkes, Many faine as they were dead, Vnwieldie, slow, heauy, and pale as lead. O God she comes, O hony Nurse what newes? Hast thou met with him? send thy man away Peter stay at the gate Now good sweet Nurse: O Lord, why lookest thou sad? Though newes, be sad, yet tell them merrily. If good thou sham'st the musicke of sweet newes, By playing it to me, with so sower a face I am a weary, giue me leaue awhile, Fie how my bones ake, what a iaunt haue I had? I would thou had'st my bones, and I thy newes: Nay come I pray thee speake, good good Nurse speake Iesu what hast? can you not stay a while? Do you not see that I am out of breath? How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breth To say to me, that thou art out of breath? The excuse that thou dost make in this delay, Is longer then the tale thou dost excuse. Is thy newes good or bad? answere to that, Say either, and Ile stay the circumstance: Let me be satisfied, ist good or bad? Well, you haue made a simple choice, you know not how to chuse a man: Romeo, no not he though his face be better then any mans, yet his legs excels all mens, and for a hand, and a foote, and a body, though they be not to be talkt on, yet they are past compare: he is not the flower of curtesie, but Ile warrant him as gentle a Lambe: go thy waies wench, serue God. What haue you din'd at home? No no: but all this did I know before What saies he of our marriage? what of that? Lord how my head akes, what a head haue I? It beates as it would fall in twenty peeces. My backe a tother side: o my backe, my backe: Beshrew your heart for sending me about To catch my death with iaunting vp and downe Ifaith: I am sorrie that thou art so well. Sweet sweet, sweet Nurse, tell me what saies my Loue? Your Loue saies like an honest Gentleman, And a courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, And I warrant a vertuous: where is your Mother? Where is my Mother? Why she is within, where should she be? How odly thou repli'st: Your Loue saies like an honest Gentleman: Where is your Mother? O Gods Lady deare, Are you so hot? marrie come vp I trow, Is this the Poultis for my aking bones? Henceforward do your messages your selfe Heere's such a coile, come what saies Romeo? Haue you got leaue to go to shift to day? I haue Then high you hence to Frier Lawrence Cell, There staies a Husband to make you a wife: Now comes the wanton bloud vp in your cheekes, Thei'le be in Scarlet straight at any newes: Hie you to Church, I must an other way, To fetch a Ladder by the which your Loue Must climde a birds nest Soone when it is darke: I am the drudge, and toile in your delight: But you shall beare the burthen soone at night. Go Ile to dinner, hie you to the Cell Hie to high Fortune, honest Nurse, farewell. So smile the heauens vpon this holy act, That after houres, with sorrow chide vs not Amen, amen, but come what sorrow can, It cannot counteruaile the exchange of ioy That one short minute giues me in her sight: Do thou but close our hands with holy words. Then Loue-deuouring death do what he dare, It is inough. I may call her mine These violent delights haue violent endes, And in their triumph: die like fire and powder; Which as they kisse consume. The sweetest honey Is loathsome in his owne deliciousnesse, And in the taste confoundes the appetite. Therefore Loue moderately, long Loue doth so, Too swift arriues as tardie as too slow. Here comes the Lady. Oh so light a foot Will nere weare out the euerlasting flint, A Louer may bestride the Gossamours, That ydles in the wanton Summer ayre, And yet not fall, so light is vanitie Good euen to my ghostly Confessor Romeo shall thanke thee Daughter for vs both As much to him, else in his thanks too much Ah Iuliet, if the measure of thy ioy Be heapt like mine, and that thy skill be more To blason it, then sweeten with thy breath This neighbour ayre, and let rich musickes tongue, Vnfold the imagin'd happinesse that both Receiue in either, by this deere encounter Conceit more rich in matter then in words, Brags of his substance, not of Ornament: They are but beggers that can count their worth, But my true Loue is growne to such excesse, I cannot sum vp some of halfe my wealth Come, come with me, & we will make short worke, For by your leaues, you shall not stay alone, Till holy Church incorporate two in one. I pray thee good Mercutio lets retire, The day is hot, the Capulets abroad: And if we meet, we shal not scape a brawle, for now these hot dayes, is the mad blood stirring Thou art like one of these fellowes, that when he the Table, and sayes, God send me no need of thee: and by the operation of the second cup, drawes him on the Drawer, when indeed there is no need Am I like such a Fellow? Come, come, thou art as hot a Iacke in thy mood, as any in Italie: and assoone moued to be moodie, and assoone moodie to be mou'd And what too? Nay, and there were two such, we should haue none shortly, for one would kill the other: thou, why thou wilt quarrell with a man that hath a haire more, or a haire lesse in his beard, then thou hast: thou wilt quarrell with a man for cracking Nuts, hauing no other reason, but because thou hast hasell eyes: what eye, but such an eye, would spie out such a quarrell? thy head is full of quarrels, as an egge is full of meat, and yet thy head hath bin beaten as addle as an egge for quarreling: thou hast quarrel'd with a man for coffing in the street, because he hath wakened thy Dog that hath laine asleepe in the Sun. Did'st thou not fall out with a Tailor for wearing his new Doublet before Easter? with another, for tying his new shooes with old Riband, and yet thou wilt Tutor me from quarrelling? And I were so apt to quarell as thou art, any man should buy the Fee-simple of my life, for an houre and a quarter The Fee-simple? O simple. By my head here comes the Capulets By my heele I care not Follow me close, for I will speake to them. Gentlemen, Good den, a word with one of you And but one word with one of vs? couple it with something, make it a word and a blow You shall find me apt inough to that sir, and you will giue me occasion Could you not take some occasion without giuing? Mercutio thou consort'st with Romeo Consort? what dost thou make vs Minstrels? & thou make Minstrels of vs, looke to heare nothing but discords: heere's my fiddlesticke, heere's that shall make you daunce. Come consort We talke here in the publike haunt of men, Either withdraw vnto some priuate place, Or reason coldly of your greeuances: Or else depart, here all eies gaze on vs Mens eyes were made to looke, and let them gaze. I will not budge for no mans pleasure I. Well peace be with you sir, here comes my man But Ile be hang'd sir if he weare your Liuery. Marry go before to field, heele be your follower, Your worship in that sense, may call him man Romeo, the loue I beare thee, can affoord No better terme then this: Thou art a Villaine Tibalt, the reason that I haue to loue thee, Doth much excuse the appertaining rage To such a greeting: Villaine am I none; Therefore farewell, I see thou know'st me not Boy, this shall not excuse the iniuries That thou hast done me, therefore turne and draw I do protest I neuer iniur'd thee, But lou'd thee better then thou can'st deuise: Till thou shalt know the reason of my loue, And so good Capulet, which name I tender As dearely as my owne, be satisfied O calme, dishonourable, vile submission: Alla stucatho carries it away. Tybalt, you Rat-catcher, will you walke? What wouldst thou haue with me? Good King of Cats, nothing but one of your nine liues, that I meane to make bold withall, and as you shall vse me hereafter dry beate the rest of the eight. Will you pluck your Sword out of his Pilcher by the eares? Make hast, least mine be about your eares ere it be out I am for you Gentle Mercutio, put thy Rapier vp Come sir, your Passado Draw Benuolio, beat downe their weapons: Gentlemen, for shame forbeare this outrage, Tibalt, Mercutio, the Prince expresly hath Forbidden bandying in Verona streetes.

I am pepper'd I warrant, for this world: a plague a both your houses. What, a Dog, a Rat, a Mouse, a Cat to scratch a man to death: a Braggart, a Rogue, a Villaine, that fights by the booke of Arithmeticke, why the deu'le came you betweene vs? I was hurt vnder your arme I thought all for the best Helpe me into some house Benuolio, Or I shall faint: a plague a both your houses. They haue made wormesmeat of me, I haue it, and soundly to your Houses. This Gentleman the Princes neere Alie, My very Friend hath got his mortall hurt In my behalfe, my reputation stain'd With Tibalts slaunder, Tybalt that an houre Hath beene my Cozin: O Sweet Iuliet, Thy Beauty hath made me Effeminate, And in my temper softned Valours steele. O Romeo, Romeo, braue Mercutio's is dead, That Gallant spirit hath aspir'd the Cloudes, Which too vntimely here did scorne the earth This daies blacke Fate, on mo daies depend, This but begins, the wo others must end. Here comes the Furious Tybalt backe againe He gon in triumph, and Mercutio slaine? Away to heauen respectiue Lenitie, And fire and Fury, be my conduct now. Now Tybalt take the Villaine backe againe That late thou gau'st me, for Mercutios soule Is but a little way aboue our heads, Staying for thine to keepe him companie: Either thou or I, or both, must goe with him Thou wretched Boy that didst consort him here, Shalt with him hence This shall determine that. They fight. Tybalt falles. Romeo, away be gone: The Citizens are vp, and Tybalt slaine, Stand not amaz'd, the Prince will Doome thee death If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away O! I am Fortunes foole Why dost thou stay? Which way ran he that kild Mercutio? Tibalt that Murtherer, which way ran he? There lies that Tybalt Vp sir go with me: I charge thee in the Princes names obey. Where are the vile beginners of this Fray? O Noble Prince, I can discouer all The vnluckie Mannage of this fatall brall: There lies the man slaine by young Romeo, That slew thy kinsman braue Mercutio Wi. Tybalt, my Cozin? O my Brothers Child, O Prince, O Cozin, Husband, O the blood is spild Of my deare kinsman. Prince as thou art true, For bloud of ours, shed bloud of Mountague. O Cozin, Cozin Benuolio, who began this Fray? Tybalt here slaine, whom Romeo's hand did slay, Romeo that spoke him faire, bid him bethinke How nice the Quarrell was, and vrg'd withall Your high displeasure: all this vttered, With gentle breath, calme looke, knees humbly bow'd Could not take truce with the vnruly spleene Of Tybalts deafe to peace, but that he Tilts With Peircing steele at bold Mercutio's breast, Who all as hot, turnes deadly point to point, And with a Martiall scorne, with one hand beates Cold death aside, and with the other sends It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud, Hold Friends, Friends part, and swifter then his tongue, His aged arme, beats downe their fatall points, And twixt them rushes, vnderneath whose arme, An enuious thrust from Tybalt, hit the life Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled. But by and by comes backe to Romeo, Who had but newly entertained Reuenge, And too't they goe like lightning, for ere I Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slaine: And as he fell, did Romeo turne and flie: This is the truth, or let Benuolio die Wi. He is a kinsman to the Mountague, Affection makes him false, he speakes not true: Some twenty of them fought in this blacke strife, And all those twenty could but kill one life. I beg for Iustice, which thou Prince must giue: Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not liue Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio, Who now the price of his deare blood doth owe Not Romeo Prince, he was Mercutios Friend, His fault concludes, but what the law should end, The life of Tybalt And for that offence, Immediately we doe exile him hence: I haue an interest in your hearts proceeding: My bloud for your rude brawles doth lie a bleeding. But Ile Amerce you with so strong a fine, That you shall all repent the losse of mine. It will be deafe to pleading and excuses, Nor teares, nor prayers shall purchase our abuses. Therefore vse none, let Romeo hence in hast, Else when he is found, that houre is his last. Beare hence his body, and attend our will: Mercy not Murders, pardoning those that kill. Gallop apace, you fiery footed steedes, Towards Phoebus lodging, such a Wagoner As Phaeton would whip you to the west, And bring in Cloudie night immediately. Spred thy close Curtaine Loue-performing night, That run-awayes eyes may wincke, and Romeo Leape to these armes, vntalkt of and vnseene, Louers can see to doe their Amorous rights, And by their owne Beauties: or if Loue be blind, It best agrees with night: come ciuill night, Thou sober suted Matron all in blacke, And learne me how to loose a winning match, Plaid for a paire of stainlesse Maidenhoods, Hood my vnman'd blood bayting in my Cheekes, With thy Blacke mantle, till strange Loue grow bold, Thinke true Loue acted simple modestie: Come night, come Romeo, come thou day in night, For thou wilt lie vpon the wings of night Whiter then new Snow vpon a Rauens backe: Come gentle night, come louing blackebrow'd night. Giue me my Romeo, and when I shall die, Take him and cut him out in little starres, And he will make the Face of heauen so fine, That all the world will be in Loue with night, And pay no worship to the Garish Sun. O I haue bought the Mansion of a Loue, But not possest it, and though I am sold, Not yet enioy'd, so tedious is this day, As is the night before some Festiuall, To an impatient child that hath new robes And may not weare them, O here comes my Nurse: And she brings newes and euery tongue that speaks But Romeos name, speakes heauenly eloquence: Now Nurse, what newes? what hast thou there? The Cords that Romeo bid thee fetch? I, I, the Cords Ay me, what newes? Why dost thou wring thy hands A weladay, hee's dead, hee's dead, We are vndone Lady, we are vndone. Alacke the day, hee's gone, hee's kil'd, he's dead Can heauen be so enuious? Romeo can, Though heauen cannot. O Romeo, Romeo. Who euer would haue thought it Romeo What diuell art thou, That dost torment me thus? This torture should be roar'd in dismall hell, Hath Romeo slaine himselfe? say thou but I, And that bare vowell I shall poyson more Then the death-darting eye of Cockatrice, I am not I, if there be such an I. Or those eyes shot, that makes thee answere I: If he be slaine say I, or if not, no. Briefe, sounds, determine of my weale or wo I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes, God saue the marke, here on his manly brest, A pitteous Coarse, a bloody piteous Coarse: Pale, pale as ashes, all bedawb'd in blood, All in gore blood I sounded at the sight O breake my heart, Poore Banckrout breake at once, To prison eyes, nere looke on libertie. Vile earth to earth resigne, end motion here, And thou and Romeo presse on heauie beere O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best Friend I had: O curteous Tybalt honest Gentleman, That euer I should liue to see thee dead What storme is this that blowes so contrarie? Is Romeo slaughtred? and is Tybalt dead? My dearest Cozen, and my dearer Lord: Then dreadfull Trumpet sound the generall doome, For who is liuing, if those two are gone? Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished, Romeo that kil'd him, he is banished O God! Did Romeo's hand shed Tybalts blood It did, it did, alas the day, it did O Serpent heart hid with a flowring face Did euer Dragon keepe so faire a Caue? Beautifull Tyrant, fiend Angelicall: Rauenous Doue-feather'd Rauen, Woluish-rauening Lambe, Dispised substance of Diuinest show: Iust opposite to what thou iustly seem'st, A dimne Saint, an Honourable Villaine: O Nature! what had'st thou to doe in hell, When thou did'st bower the spirit of a fiend In mortall paradise of such sweet flesh? Was euer booke containing such vile matter So fairely bound? O that deceit should dwell In such a gorgeous Pallace There's no trust, no faith, no honestie in men, All periur'd, all forsworne, all naught, all dissemblers, Ah where's my man? giue me some Aqua-vitae? These griefes, these woes, these sorrowes make me old: Shame come to Romeo Blister'd be thy tongue For such a wish, he was not borne to shame: Vpon his brow shame is asham'd to sit; For 'tis a throane where Honour may be Crown'd Sole Monarch of the vniuersall earth: O what a beast was I to chide him? Will you speake well of him, That kil'd your Cozen? Shall I speake ill of him that is my husband? Ah poore my Lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name, When I thy three houres wife haue mangled it. But wherefore Villaine did'st thou kill my Cozin? That Villaine Cozin would haue kil'd my husband: Backe foolish teares, backe to your natiue spring, Your tributarie drops belong to woe, Which you mistaking offer vp to ioy: My husband liues that Tibalt would haue slaine, And Tibalt dead that would haue slaine my husband: All this is comfort, wherefore weepe I then? Some words there was worser then Tybalts death That murdered me, I would forget it feine, But oh, it presses to my memory, Like damned guilty deedes to sinners minds, Tybalt is dead and Romeo banished: That banished, that one word banished, Hath slaine ten thousand Tibalts: Tibalts death Was woe inough if it had ended there: Or if sower woe delights in fellowship, And needly will be rankt with other griefes, Why followed not when she said Tibalts dead, Thy Father or thy Mother, nay or both, Which moderne lamentation might haue mou'd. But which a rere-ward following Tybalts death Romeo is banished to speake that word, Is Father, Mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Iuliet, All slaine, all dead: Romeo is banished, There is no end, no limit, measure, bound, In that words death, no words can that woe sound. Where is my Father and my Mother Nurse? Weeping and wailing ouer Tybalts Coarse, Will you go to them? I will bring you thither Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shal be spent When theirs are drie for Romeo's banishment. Take vp those Cordes, poore ropes you are beguil'd, Both you and I for Romeo is exild: He made you for a high-way to my bed, But I a Maid, die Maiden widowed. Come Cord, come Nurse, Ile to my wedding bed, And death not Romeo, take my Maiden head Hie to your Chamber, Ile find Romeo To comfort you, I wot well where he is: Harke ye your Romeo will be heere at night, Ile to him, he is hid at Lawrence Cell O find him, giue this Ring to my true Knight, And bid him come, to take his last farewell. Romeo come forth, Come forth thou fearfull man, Affliction is enamor'd of thy parts And thou art wedded to calamitie, Father what newes? What is the Princes Doome? What sorrow craues acquaintance at my hand, That I yet know not? Too familiar Is my deare Sonne with such sowre Company I bring thee tydings of the Princes Doome What lesse then Doomesday, Is the Princes Doome? A gentler iudgement vanisht from his lips, Not bodies death, but bodies banishment Ha, banishment? be mercifull, say death: For exile hath more terror in his looke, Much more then death: do not say banishment Here from Verona art thou banished: Be patient, for the world is broad and wide There is no world without Verona walles, But Purgatorie, Torture, hell it selfe: Hence banished, is banisht from the world, And worlds exile is death. Then banished, Is death, mistearm'd, calling death banished, Thou cut'st my head off with a golden Axe, And smilest vpon the stroke that murders me O deadly sin, O rude vnthankefulnesse! Thy falt our Law calles death, but the kind Prince Taking thy part, hath rusht aside the Law, And turn'd that blacke word death, to banishment. This is deare mercy, and thou seest it not 'Tis Torture and not mercy, heauen is here Where Iuliet liues, and euery Cat and Dog, And little Mouse, euery vnworthy thing Liue here in Heauen and may looke on her, But Romeo may not. More Validitie, More Honourable state, more Courtship liues In carrion Flies, then Romeo: they may seaze On the white wonder of deare Iuliets hand, And steale immortall blessing from her lips, Who euen in pure and vestall modestie Still blush, as thinking their owne kisses sin. This may Flies doe, when I from this must flie, And saist thou yet, that exile is not death? But Romeo may not, hee is banished. Had'st thou no poyson mixt, no sharpe ground knife, No sudden meane of death, though nere so meane, But banished to kill me? Banished? O Frier, the damned vse that word in hell: Howlings attends it, how hast then the hart Being a Diuine, a Ghostly Confessor, A Sin-Absoluer, and my Friend profest: To mangle me with that word, banished? Then fond Mad man, heare me speake O thou wilt speake againe of banishment Ile giue thee Armour to keepe off that word, Aduersities sweete milke, Philosophie, To comfort thee, though thou art banished Yet banished? hang vp Philosophie: Vnlesse Philosophie can make a Iuliet, Displant a Towne, reuerse a Princes Doome, It helpes not, it preuailes not, talke no more O then I see, that Mad men haue no eares How should they, When wisemen haue no eyes? Let me dispaire with thee of thy estate, Thou can'st not speake of that y dost not feele, Wert thou as young as Iuliet my Loue: An houre but married, Tybalt murdered, Doting like me, and like me banished, Then mightest thou speake, Then mightest thou teare thy hayre, And fall vpon the ground as I doe now, Taking the measure of an vnmade graue. Arise one knockes, Good Romeo hide thy selfe Not I, Vnlesse the breath of Hartsicke groanes Mist-like infold me from the search of eyes. Knocke Harke how they knocke: (Who's there) Romeo arise, Thou wilt be taken, stay a while, stand vp: Run to my study: by and by, Gods will What simplenesse is this: I come, I come. Who knocks so hard? Whence come you? what's your will? Let me come in, And you shall know my errand: I come from Lady Iuliet Welcome then O holy Frier, O tell me holy Frier, Where's my Ladies Lord? where's Romeo? There on the ground, With his owne teares made drunke O he is euen in my Mistresse case, Iust in her case. O wofull simpathy: Pittious predicament, euen so lies she, Blubbring and weeping, weeping and blubbring, Stand vp, stand vp, stand and you be a man, For Iuliets sake, for her sake rise and stand: Why should you fall into so deepe an O Nurse Ah sir, ah sir, deaths the end of all Speak'st thou of Iuliet? how is it with her? Doth not she thinke me an old Murtherer, Now I haue stain'd the Childhood of our ioy, With blood remoued, but little from her owne? Where is she? and how doth she? and what sayes My conceal'd Lady to our conceal'd Loue? Oh she sayes nothing sir, but weeps and weeps, And now fals on her bed, and then starts vp, And Tybalt calls, and then on Romeo cries, And then downe falls againe As if that name shot from the dead leuell of a Gun, Did murder her, as that names cursed hand Murdred her kinsman. Oh tell me Frier, tell me, In what vile part of this Anatomie Doth my name lodge? Tell me, that I may sacke The hatefull Mansion Hold thy desperate hand: Art thou a man? thy forme cries out thou art: Thy teares are womanish, thy wild acts denote The vnreasonable Furie of a beast. Vnseemely woman, in a seeming man, And ill beseeming beast in seeming both, Thou hast amaz'd me. By my holy order, I thought thy disposition better temper'd. Hast thou slaine Tybalt? wilt thou slay thy selfe? And slay thy Lady, that in thy life lies, By doing damned hate vpon thy selfe? Why rayl'st thou on thy birth? the heauen and earth? Since birth, and heauen and earth, all three do meete In thee at once, which thou at once would'st loose. Fie, fie, thou sham'st thy shape, thy loue, thy wit, Which like a Vsurer abound'st in all: And vsest none in that true vse indeed, Which should bedecke thy shape, thy loue, thy wit: Thy Noble shape, is but a forme of waxe, Digressing from the Valour of a man, Thy deare Loue sworne but hollow periurie, Killing that Loue which thou hast vow'd to cherish. Thy wit, that Ornament, to shape and Loue, Mishapen in the conduct of them both: Like powder in a skillesse Souldiers flaske, Is set a fire by thine owne ignorance, And thou dismembred with thine owne defence. What, rowse thee man, thy Iuliet is aliue, For whose deare sake thou wast but lately dead. There art thou happy. Tybalt would kill thee, But thou slew'st Tybalt, there art thou happie. The law that threatned death became thy Friend. And turn'd it to exile, there art thou happy. A packe or blessing light vpon thy backe, Happinesse Courts thee in her best array, But like a mishaped and sullen wench, Thou puttest vp thy Fortune and thy Loue: Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable. Goe get thee to thy Loue as was decreed, Ascend her Chamber, hence and comfort her: But looke thou stay not till the watch be set, For then thou canst not passe to Mantua, Where thou shalt liue till we can finde a time To blaze your marriage, reconcile your Friends, Beg pardon of thy Prince, and call thee backe, With twenty hundred thousand times more ioy Then thou went'st forth in lamentation. Goe before Nurse, commend me to thy Lady, And bid her hasten all the house to bed, Which heauy sorrow makes them apt vnto. Romeo is comming O Lord, I could haue staid here all night, To heare good counsell: oh what learning is! My Lord Ile tell my Lady you will come Do so, and bid my Sweete prepare to chide Heere sir, a Ring she bid me giue you sir: Hie you, make hast, for it growes very late How well my comfort is reuiu'd by this Go hence, Goodnight, and here stands all your state: Either be gone before the watch be set, Or by the breake of day disguis'd from hence, Soiourne in Mantua, Ile find out your man, And he shall signifie from time to time, Euery good hap to you, that chaunces heere: Giue me thy hand, 'tis late, farewell, goodnight But that a ioy past ioy, calls out on me, It were a griefe, so briefe to part with thee: Things haue falne out sir so vnluckily, That we haue had no time to moue our Daughter: Looke you, she Lou'd her kinsman Tybalt dearely, And so did I. Well, we were borne to die. 'Tis very late, she'l not come downe to night: I promise you, but for your company, I would haue bin a bed an houre ago These times of wo, affoord no times to wooe: Madam goodnight, commend me to your Daughter I will, and know her mind early to morrow, To night, she is mewed vp to her heauinesse Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender Of my Childes loue: I thinke she will be rul'd In all respects by me: nay more, I doubt it not. Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed, Acquaint her here, of my Sonne Paris Loue, And bid her, marke you me, on Wendsday next, But soft, what day is this? Monday my Lord Monday, ha ha: well Wendsday is too soone, A Thursday let it be: a Thursday tell her, She shall be married to this Noble Earle: Will you be ready? do you like this hast? Weele keepe no great adoe, a Friend or two, For harke you, Tybalt being slaine so late, It may be thought we held him carelesly, Being our kinsman, if we reuell much: Therefore weele haue some halfe a dozen Friends, And there an end. But what say you to Thursday? My Lord, I would that Thursday were to morrow Well, get you gone, a Thursday, be it then: Go you to Iuliet ere you go to bed, Prepare her wife, against this wedding day. Farewell my Lord, light to my Chamber hoa, Afore me, it is so late, that we may call it early by and by, Wilt thou be gone? It is not yet neere day: It was the Nightingale, and not the Larke, That pier'st the fearefull hollow of thine eare, Nightly she sings on yond Pomgranet tree, Beleeue me Loue, it was the Nightingale It was the Larke the Herauld of the Morne: No Nightingale: looke Loue what enuious streakes Do lace the seuering Cloudes in yonder East: Nights Candles are burnt out, and Iocond day Stands tipto on the mistie Mountaines tops, I must be gone and liue, or stay and die Yond light is not daylight, I know it I: It is some Meteor that the Sun exhales, To be to thee this night a Torch-bearer, And light thee on thy way to Mantua. Therefore stay yet, thou need'st not be gone, Let me be tane, let me be put to death, I am content, so thou wilt haue it so. Ile say yon gray is not the mornings eye, 'Tis but the pale reflexe of Cinthias brow. Nor that is not Larke whose noates do beate The vaulty heauen so high aboue our heads, I haue more care to stay, then will to go: Come death and welcome, Iuliet wills it so. How ist my soule, lets talke, it is not day It is, it is, hie hence be gone away: It is the Larke that sings so out of tune, Straining harsh Discords, and vnpleasing Sharpes. Some say the Larke makes sweete Diuision; This doth not so: for she diuideth vs. Some say, the Larke and loathed Toad change eyes, O now I would they had chang'd voyces too: Since arme from arme that voyce doth vs affray, Hunting thee hence, with Hunts-vp to the day, O now be gone, more light and it light growes More light & light, more darke & darke our woes. Madam Nurse Your Lady Mother is comming to your chamber, The day is broke, be wary, looke about Then window let day in, and let life out Farewell, farewell, one kisse and Ile descend Art thou gone so? Loue, Lord, ay Husband, Friend, I must heare from thee euery day in the houre, For in a minute there are many dayes, O by this count I shall be much in yeares, Ere I againe behold my Romeo Farewell: I will omit no oportunitie, That may conuey my greetings Loue, to thee O thinkest thou we shall euer meet againe? I doubt it not, and all these woes shall serue For sweet discourses in our time to come O God! I haue an ill Diuining soule, Me thinkes I see thee now, thou art so lowe, As one dead in the bottome of a Tombe, Either my eye-sight failes, or thou look'st pale And trust me Loue, in my eye so do you: Drie sorrow drinkes our blood. Adue, adue. O Fortune, Fortune, all men call thee fickle, If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him That is renown'd for faith? be fickle Fortune: For then I hope thou wilt not keepe him long, But send him backe. Ho Daughter, are you vp? Who ist that calls? Is it my Lady Mother. Is she not downe so late, or vp so early? What vnaccustom'd cause procures her hither? Why how now Iuliet? Madam I am not well Euermore weeping for your Cozins death? What wilt thou wash him from his graue with teares? And if thou could'st, thou could'st not make him liue: Therefore haue done, some griefe shewes much of Loue, But much of griefe, shewes still some want of wit Yet let me weepe, for such a feeling losse So shall you feele the losse, but not the Friend Which you weepe for Feeling so the losse, I cannot chuse but euer weepe the Friend Well Girle, thou weep'st not so much for his death, As that the Villaine liues which slaughter'd him What Villaine, Madam? That same Villaine Romeo Villaine and he, be many miles assunder: God pardon, I doe with all my heart: And yet no man like he, doth grieue my heart That is because the Traitor liues I Madam from the reach of these my hands: Would none but I might venge my Cozins death We will haue vengeance for it, feare thou not. Then weepe no more, Ile send to one in Mantua, Where that same banisht Run-agate doth liue, Shall giue him such an vnaccustom'd dram, That he shall soone keepe Tybalt company: And then I hope thou wilt be satisfied Indeed I neuer shall be satisfied With Romeo, till I behold him. Dead Is my poore heart so for a kinsman vext: Madam, if you could find out but a man To beare a poyson, I would temper it; That Romeo should vpon receit thereof, Soone sleepe in quiet. O how my heart abhors To heare him nam'd, and cannot come to him, To wreake the Loue I bore my Cozin, Vpon his body that hath slaughter'd him Find thou the meanes, and Ile find such a man. But now Ile tell thee ioyfull tidings Gyrle And ioy comes well, in such a needy time, What are they, beseech your Ladyship? Well, well, thou hast a carefull Father Child? One who to put thee from thy heauinesse, Hath sorted out a sudden day of ioy, That thou expects not, nor I lookt not for Madam in happy time, what day is this? Marry my Child, early next Thursday morne, The gallant, young, and Noble Gentleman, The Countie Paris at Saint Peters Church, Shall happily make thee a ioyfull Bride Now by Saint Peters Church, and Peter too, He shall not make me there a ioyfull Bride. I wonder at this hast, that I must wed Ere he that should be Husband comes to woe: I pray you tell my Lord and Father Madam, I will not marrie yet, and when I doe, I sweare It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate Rather then Paris. These are newes indeed Here comes your Father, tell him so your selfe, And see how he will take it at your hands. When the Sun sets, the earth doth drizzle deaw But for the Sunset of my Brothers Sonne, It raines downright. How now? A Conduit Gyrle, what still in teares? Euermore showring in one little body? Thou counterfaits a Barke, a Sea, a Wind: For still thy eyes, which I may call the Sea, Do ebbe and flow with teares, the Barke thy body is Sayling in this salt floud, the windes thy sighes, Who raging with the teares and they with them, Without a sudden calme will ouer set Thy tempest tossed body. How now wife? Haue you deliuered to her our decree? I sir; But she will none, she giues you thankes, I would the foole were married to her graue Soft, take me with you, take me with you wife, How, will she none? doth she not giue vs thanks? Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest, Vnworthy as she is, that we haue wrought So worthy a Gentleman, to be her Bridegroome Not proud you haue, But thankfull that you haue: Proud can I neuer be of what I haue, But thankfull euen for hate, that is meant Loue How now? How now? Chopt Logicke? what is this? Proud, and I thanke you: and I thanke you not. Thanke me no thankings, nor proud me no prouds, But fettle your fine ioints 'gainst Thursday next, To go with Paris to Saint Peters Church: Or I will drag thee, on a Hurdle thither. Out you greene sicknesse carrion, out you baggage, You tallow face Fie, fie, what are you mad? Good Father, I beseech you on my knees Heare me with patience, but to speake a word Hang thee young baggage, disobedient wretch, I tell thee what, get thee to Church a Thursday, Or neuer after looke me in the face. Speake not, reply not, do not answere me. My fingers itch, wife: we scarce thought vs blest, That God had lent vs but this onely Child, But now I see this one is one too much, And that we haue a curse in hauing her: Out on her Hilding God in heauen blesse her, You are too blame my Lord to rate her so And why my Lady wisedome? hold your tongue, Good Prudence, smatter with your gossip, go I speak no treason, Father, O Godigoden, May not one speake? Peace you mumbling foole, Vtter your grauitie ore a Gossips bowles For here we need it not You are too hot Gods bread, it makes me mad: Day, night, houre, ride, time, worke, play, Alone in companie, still my care hath bin To haue her matcht, and hauing now prouided A Gentleman of Noble Parentage, Of faire Demeanes, Youthfull, and Nobly Allied, Stuft as they say with Honourable parts, Proportion'd as ones thought would wish a man, And then to haue a wretched puling foole, A whining mammet, in her Fortunes tender, To answer, Ile not wed, I cannot Loue: I am too young, I pray you pardon me. But, and you will not wed, Ile pardon you. Graze where you will, you shall not house with me: Looke too't, thinke on't, I do not vse to iest. Thursday is neere, lay hand on heart, aduise, And you be mine, Ile giue you to my Friend: And you be not, hang, beg, starue, die in the streets, For by my soule, Ile nere acknowledge thee, Nor what is mine shall neuer do thee good: Trust too't, bethinke you, Ile not be forsworne Is there no pittie sitting in the Cloudes, That sees into the bottome of my griefe? O sweet my Mother cast me not away, Delay this marriage, for a month, a weeke, Or if you do not, make the Bridall bed In that dim Monument where Tybalt lies Talke not to me, for Ile not speake a word, Do as thou wilt, for I haue done with thee. O God! O Nurse, how shall this be preuented? My Husband is on earth, my faith in heauen, How shall that faith returne againe to earth, Vnlesse that Husband send it me from heauen, By leauing earth? Comfort me, counsaile me: Alacke, alacke, that heauen should practise stratagems Vpon so soft a subiect as my selfe. What saist thou? hast thou not a word of ioy? Some comfort Nurse Faith here it is, Romeo is banished, and all the world to nothing, That he dares nere come backe to challenge you: Or if he do, it needs must be by stealth. Then since the case so stands as now it doth, I thinke it best you married with the Countie, O hee's a Louely Gentleman: Romeos a dish-clout to him: an Eagle Madam Hath not so greene, so quicke, so faire an eye As Paris hath, beshrow my very heart, I thinke you are happy in this second match, For it excels your first: or if it did not, Your first is dead, or 'twere as good he were, As liuing here and you no vse of him Speakest thou from thy heart? And from my soule too, Or else beshrew them both Amen What? Well, thou hast comforted me marue'lous much, Go in, and tell my Lady I am gone, Hauing displeas'd my Father, to Lawrence Cell, To make confession, and to be absolu'd Marrie I will, and this is wisely done Auncient damnation, O most wicked fiend! It is more sin to wish me thus forsworne, Or to dispraise my Lord with that same tongue Which she hath prais'd him with aboue compare, So many thousand times? Go Counsellor, Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twaine: Ile to the Frier to know his remedie, If all else faile, my selfe haue power to die. On Thursday sir? the time is very short My Father Capulet will haue it so, And I am nothing slow to slack his hast You say you do not know the Ladies mind? Vneuen is the course, I like it not Immoderately she weepes for Tybalts death, And therfore haue I little talke of Loue, For Venus smiles not in a house of teares. Now sir, her Father counts it dangerous That she doth giue her sorrow so much sway: And in his wisedome, hasts our marriage, To stop the inundation of her teares, Which too much minded by her selfe alone, May be put from her by societie. Now doe you know the reason of this hast? I would I knew not why it should be slow'd. Looke sir, here comes the Lady towards my Cell. Happily met, my Lady and my wife That may be sir, when I may be a wife That may be, must be Loue, on Thursday next What must be shall be That's a certaine text Come you to make confession to this Father? To answere that, I should confesse to you Do not denie to him, that you Loue me I will confesse to you that I Loue him So will ye, I am sure that you Loue me If I do so, it will be of more price, Being spoke behind your backe, then to your face Poore soule, thy face is much abus'd with teares The teares haue got small victorie by that: For it was bad inough before their spight Thou wrong'st it more then teares with that report That is no slaunder sir, which is a truth, And what I spake, I spake it to thy face Thy face is mine, and thou hast slaundred it It may be so, for it is not mine owne. Are you at leisure, Holy Father now, Or shall I come to you at euening Masse? My leisure serues me pensiue daughter now. My Lord you must intreat the time alone Godsheild: I should disturbe Deuotion, Iuliet, on Thursday early will I rowse yee, Till then adue, and keepe this holy kisse. O shut the doore, and when thou hast done so, Come weepe with me, past hope, past care, past helpe O Iuliet, I alreadie know thy griefe, It streames me past the compasse of my wits: I heare thou must and nothing may prorogue it, On Thursday next be married to this Countie Tell me not Frier that thou hearest of this, Vnlesse thou tell me how I may preuent it: If in thy wisedome, thou canst giue no helpe, Do thou but call my resolution wise, And with this knife, Ile helpe it presently. God ioyn'd my heart, and Romeos, thou our hands, And ere this hand by thee to Romeo seal'd: Shall be the Labell to another Deede, Or my true heart with trecherous reuolt, Turne to another, this shall slay them both: Therefore out of thy long experien'st time, Giue me some present counsell, or behold Twixt my extreames and me, this bloody knife Shall play the vmpeere, arbitrating that, Which the commission of thy yeares and art, Could to no issue of true honour bring: Be not so long to speak, I long to die, If what thou speak'st, speake not of remedy Hold Daughter, I doe spie a kind of hope, Which craues as desperate an execution, As that is desperate which we would preuent. If rather then to marrie Countie Paris Thou hast the strength of will to slay thy selfe, Then is it likely thou wilt vndertake A thing like death to chide away this shame, That coap'st with death himselfe, to scape fro it: And if thou dar'st, Ile giue thee remedie Oh bid me leape, rather then marrie Paris, From of the Battlements of any Tower, Or walke in theeuish waies, or bid me lurke Where Serpents are: chaine me with roaring Beares Or hide me nightly in a Charnell house, Orecouered quite with dead mens ratling bones, With reckie shankes and yellow chappels sculls: Or bid me go into a new made graue, And hide me with a dead man in his graue, Things that to heare them told, haue made me tremble, And I will doe it without feare or doubt, To liue an vnstained wife to my sweet Loue Hold then: goe home, be merrie, giue consent, To marrie Paris: wensday is to morrow, To morrow night looke that thou lie alone, Let not thy Nurse lie with thee in thy Chamber: Take thou this Violl being then in bed, And this distilling liquor drinke thou off, When presently through all thy veines shall run, A cold and drowsie humour: for no pulse Shall keepe his natiue progresse, but surcease: No warmth, no breath shall testifie thou liuest, The Roses in thy lips and cheekes shall fade To many ashes, the eyes windowes fall Like death when he shut vp the day of life: Each part depriu'd of supple gouernment, Shall stiffe and starke, and cold appeare like death, And in this borrowed likenesse of shrunke death Thou shalt continue two and forty houres, And then awake, as from a pleasant sleepe. Now when the Bridegroome in the morning comes, To rowse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead: Then as the manner of our country is, In thy best Robes vncouer'd on the Beere, Be borne to buriall in thy kindreds graue: Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault, Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie, In the meane time against thou shalt awake, Shall Romeo by my Letters know our drift, And hither shall he come, and that very night Shall Romeo beare thee hence to Mantua. And this shall free thee from this present shame, If no inconstant toy nor womanish feare, Abate thy valour in the acting it Giue me, giue me, O tell me not of care Hold get you gone, be strong and prosperous: In this resolue, Ile send a Frier with speed To Mantua with my Letters to thy Lord Loue giue me strength, And the strength shall helpe afford: Farewell deare father. three. So many guests inuite as here are writ, Sirrah, go hire me twenty cunning Cookes You shall haue none ill sir, for Ile trie if they can licke their fingers How canst thou trie them so? Marrie sir, 'tis an ill Cooke that cannot licke his owne fingers: therefore he that cannot licke his fingers goes not with me Go be gone, we shall be much vnfurnisht for this time: what is my Daughter gone to Frier Lawrence? I forsooth Well he may chance to do some good on her, A peeuish selfe-wild harlotry it is. See where she comes from shrift With merrie looke How now my headstrong, Where haue you bin gadding? Where I haue learnt me to repent the sin Of disobedient opposition: To you and your behests, and am enioyn'd By holy Lawrence, to fall prostrate here, To beg your pardon: pardon I beseech you, Henceforward I am euer rul'd by you Send for the Countie, goe tell him of this, Ile haue this knot knit vp to morrow morning I met the youthfull Lord at Lawrence Cell, And gaue him what becomed Loue I might, Not stepping ore the bounds of modestie Why I am glad on't, this is well, stand vp, This is as't should be, let me see the County: I marrie go I say, and fetch him hither. Now afore God, this reueren'd holy Frier, All our whole Cittie is much bound to him Nurse will you goe with me into my Closet, To helpe me sort such needfull ornaments, As you thinke fit to furnish me to morrow? No not till Thursday, there's time inough Go Nurse, go with her, Weele to Church to morrow. We shall be short in our prouision, 'Tis now neere night Tush, I will stirre about, And all things shall be well, I warrant thee wife: Go thou to Iuliet, helpe to decke vp her, Ile not to bed to night, let me alone: Ile play the huswife for this once. What ho? They are all forth, well I will walke my selfe To Countie Paris, to prepare him vp Against to morrow, my heart is wondrous light, Since this same way-ward Gyrle is so reclaim'd. I those attires are best, but gentle Nurse I pray thee leaue me to my selfe to night: For I haue need of many Orysons, To moue the heauens to smile vpon my state, Which well thou know'st, is crosse and full of sin. What are you busie ho? need you my help? No Madam, we haue cul'd such necessaries As are behoouefull for our state to morrow: So please you, let me now be left alone; And let the Nurse this night sit vp with you, For I am sure, you haue your hands full all, In this so sudden businesse Goodnight. Get thee to bed and rest, for thou hast need. Farewell: God knowes when we shall meete againe. I haue a faint cold feare thrills through my veines, That almost freezes vp the heate of fire: Ile call them backe againe to comfort me. Nurse, what should she do here? My dismall Sceane, I needs must act alone: Come Viall, what if this mixture do not worke at all? Shall I be married then to morrow morning? No, no, this shall forbid it. Lie thou there, What if it be a poyson which the Frier Subtilly hath ministred to haue me dead, Least in this marriage he should be dishonour'd, Because he married me before to Romeo? I feare it is, and yet me thinkes it should not, For he hath still beene tried a holy man. How, if when I am laid into the Tombe, I wake before the time that Romeo Come to redeeme me? There's a fearefull point: Shall I not then be stifled in the Vault? To whose foule mouth no healthsome ayre breaths in, And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes. Or if I liue, is it not very like, The horrible conceit of death and night, Together with the terror of the place, As in a Vaulte, an ancient receptacle, Where for these many hundred yeeres the bones Of all my buried Auncestors are packt, Where bloody Tybalt, yet but greene in earth, Lies festring in his shrow'd, where as they say, At some houres in the night, Spirits resort: Alacke, alacke, is it not like that I So early waking, what with loathsome smels, And shrikes like Mandrakes torne out of the earth, That liuing mortalls hearing them, run mad. O if I wake, shall I not be distraught, Inuironed with all these hidious feares, And madly play with my forefathers ioynts? And plucke the mangled Tybalt from his shrow'd? And in this rage, with some great kinsmans bone, As (with a club) dash out my desperate braines. O looke, me thinks I see my Cozins Ghost, Seeking out Romeo that did spit his body Vpon my Rapiers point: stay Tybalt, stay; Romeo, Romeo, Romeo, here's drinke: I drinke to thee. Hold, Take these keies, and fetch more spices Nurse They call for Dates and Quinces in the Pastrie. Come, stir, stir, stir, The second Cocke hath Crow'd, The Curphew Bell hath rung, 'tis three a clocke: Looke to the bakte meates, good Angelica, Spare not for cost Go you Cot-queane, go, Get you to bed, faith youle be sicke to morrow For this nights watching No not a whit: what? I haue watcht ere now All night for lesse cause, and nere beene sicke I you haue bin a Mouse-hunt in your time, But I will watch you from such watching now. A iealous hood, a iealous hood, Now fellow, what there? Things for the Cooke sir, but I know not what Make hast, make hast, sirrah, fetch drier Logs. Call Peter, he will shew thee where they are I haue a head sir, that will find out logs, And neuer trouble Peter for the matter Masse and well said, a merrie horson, ha, Thou shalt be loggerhead; good Father, 'tis day. Play Musicke The Countie will be here with Musicke straight, For so he said he would, I heare him neere, Nurse, wife, what ho? what Nurse I say? Go waken Iuliet, go and trim her vp, Ile go and chat with Paris: hie, make hast, Make hast, the Bridegroome, he is come already: Make hast I say Mistris, what Mistris? Iuliet? Fast I warrant her she. Why Lambe, why Lady? fie you sluggabed, Why Loue I say? Madam, sweet heart: why Bride? What not a word? You take your peniworths now. Sleepe for a weeke, for the next night I warrant The Countie Paris hath set vp his rest, That you shall rest but little, God forgiue me: Marrie and Amen: how sound is she a sleepe? I must needs wake her: Madam, Madam, Madam, I, let the Countie take you in your bed, Heele fright you vp yfaith. Will it not be? What drest, and in your clothes, and downe againe? I must needs wake you: Lady, Lady, Lady? Alas, alas, helpe, helpe, my Ladyes dead, Oh weladay, that euer I was borne, Some Aqua-vit� ho, my Lord, my Lady? What noise is heere? O lamentable day What is the matter? Looke, looke, oh heauie day O me, O me, my Child, my onely life: Reuiue, looke vp, or I will die with thee: Helpe, helpe, call helpe. For shame bring Iuliet forth, her Lord is come Shee's dead: deceast, shee's dead: alacke the day Alacke the day, shee's dead, shee's dead, shee's dead Ha? Let me see her: out alas shee's cold, Her blood is setled and her ioynts are stiffe: Life and these lips haue long bene seperated: Death lies on her like an vntimely frost Vpon the swetest flower of all the field O Lamentable day! O wofull time Death that hath tane her hence to make me waile, Ties vp my tongue, and will not let me speake. Come, is the Bride ready to go to Church? Ready to go, but neuer to returne. O Sonne, the night before thy wedding day, Hath death laine with thy wife: there she lies, Flower as she was, deflowred by him. Death is my Sonne in law, death is my Heire, My Daughter he hath wedded. I will die, And leaue him all life liuing, all is deaths Haue I thought long to see this mornings face, And doth it giue me such a sight as this? Accur'st, vnhappie, wretched hatefull day, Most miserable houre, that ere time saw In lasting labour of his Pilgrimage. But one, poore one, one poore and louing Child, But one thing to reioyce and solace in, And cruell death hath catcht it from my sight O wo, O wofull, wofull, wofull day, Most lamentable day, most wofull day, That euer, euer, I did yet behold. O day, O day, O day, O hatefull day, Neuer was seene so blacke a day as this: O wofull day, O wofull day Beguild, diuorced, wronged, spighted, slaine, Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd, By cruell, cruell thee, quite ouerthrowne: O loue, O life; not life, but loue in death Despis'd, distressed, hated, martir'd, kil'd, Vncomfortable time, why cam'st thou now To murther, murther our solemnitie? O Child, O Child; my soule, and not my Child, Dead art thou, alacke my Child is dead, And with my Child, my ioyes are buried Peace ho for shame, confusions: Care liues not In these confusions, heauen and your selfe Had part in this faire Maid, now heauen hath all, And all the better is it for the Maid: Your part in her, you could not keepe from death, But heauen keepes his part in eternall life: The most you sought was her promotion, For 'twas your heauen, she shouldst be aduan'st, And weepe ye now, seeing she is aduan'st Aboue the Cloudes, as high as Heauen it selfe? O in this loue, you loue your Child so ill, That you run mad, seeing that she is well: Shee's not well married, that liues married long, But shee's best married, that dies married yong. Drie vp your teares, and sticke your Rosemarie On this faire Coarse, and as the custome is, And in her best array beare her to Church: For though some Nature bids all vs lament, Yet Natures teares are Reasons merriment All things that we ordained Festiuall, Turne from their office to blacke Funerall: Our instruments to melancholy Bells, Our wedding cheare, to a sad buriall Feast: Our solemne Hymnes, to sullen Dyrges change: Our Bridall flowers serue for a buried Coarse: And all things change them to the contrarie Sir go you in; and Madam, go with him, And go sir Paris, euery one prepare To follow this faire Coarse vnto her graue: The heauens do lowre vpon you, for some ill: Moue them no more, by crossing their high will. Faith we may put vp our Pipes and be gone Honest goodfellowes: Ah put vp, put vp, For well you know, this is a pitifull case I by my troth, the case may be amended. Musitions, oh Musitions, Hearts ease, hearts ease, O, and you will haue me liue, play hearts ease Why hearts ease; O Musitions, Because my heart it selfe plaies, my heart is full Not a dump we, 'tis no time to play now You will not then? No I will then giue it you soundly What will you giue vs? No money on my faith, but the gleeke. I will giue you the Minstrell Then will I giue you the Seruing creature Then will I lay the seruing Creatures Dagger on your pate. I will carie no Crochets, Ile Re you, Ile Fa you, do you note me? And you Re vs, and Fa vs, you Note vs 2.M. Pray you put vp your Dagger, And put out your wit. Then haue at you with my wit I will drie-beate you with an yron wit, And put vp my yron Dagger. Answere me like men: When griping griefes the heart doth wound, then Musicke with her siluer sound. Why siluer sound? why Musicke with her siluer sound? what say you Simon Catling? Mary sir, because siluer hath a sweet sound Pratest, what say you Hugh Rebicke? 2.M. I say siluer sound, because Musitions sound for siluer Pratest to, what say you Iames Sound-Post? 3.Mu. Faith I know not what to say O I cry you mercy, you are the Singer. I will say for you; it is Musicke with her siluer sound, Because Musitions haue no gold for sounding: Then Musicke with her siluer sound, with speedy helpe doth lend redresse. What a pestilent knaue is this same? 2. Hang him Iacke, come weele in here, tarrie for the Mourners, and stay dinner. If I may trust the flattering truth of sleepe, My dreames presage some ioyfull newes at hand: My bosomes L. sits lightly in his throne: And all this day an vnaccustom'd spirit, Lifts me aboue the ground with cheerefull thoughts. I dreamt my Lady came and found me dead, (Strange dreame that giues a dead man leaue to thinke,) And breath'd such life with kisses in my lips, That I reuiu'd and was an Emperour. Ah me, how sweet is loue it selfe possest, When but loues shadowes are so rich in ioy. Newes from Verona, how now Balthazer? Dost thou not bring me Letters from the Frier? How doth my Lady? Is my Father well? How doth my Lady Iuliet? that I aske againe, For nothing can be ill, is she be well Then she is well, and nothing can be ill. Her body sleepes in Capels Monument, And her immortall part with Angels liue, I saw her laid low in her kindreds Vault, And presently tooke Poste to tell it you: O pardon me for bringing these ill newes, Since you did leaue it for my office Sir Is it euen so? Then I denie you Starres. Thou knowest my lodging, get me inke and paper, And hire Post-Horses, I will hence to night I do beseech you sir, haue patience: Your lookes are pale and wild, and do import Some misaduenture Tush, thou art deceiu'd, Leaue me, and do the thing I bid thee do. Hast thou no Letters to me from the Frier? No my good Lord. No matter: Get thee gone, And hyre those Horses, Ile be with thee straight, Well Iuliet, I will lie with thee to night: Lets see for meanes, O mischiefe thou art swift, To enter in the thoughts of desperate men: I do remember an Appothecarie, And here abouts dwells, which late I noted In tattred weeds, with ouerwhelming browes, Culling of Simples, meager were his lookes, Sharp miserie had worne him to the bones: And in his needie shop a Tortoyrs hung, An Allegater stuft, and other skins Of ill shap'd fishes, and about his shelues, A beggerly account of emptie boxes , Greene earthen pots, Bladders, and mustie seedes, Remnants of packthred, and old cakes of Roses Were thinly scattered, to make vp a shew. Noting this penury, to my selfe I said, An if a man did need a poyson now, Whose sale is present death in Mantua, Here liues a Caitiffe wretch would sell it him. O this same thought did but fore-run my need, And this same needie man must sell it me. As I remember, this should be the house, Being holy day, the beggers shop is shut. What ho? Appothecarie? Who call's so low'd? Come hither man, I see that thou art poore, Hold, there is fortie Duckets, let me haue A dram of poyson, such soone speeding geare, As will disperse it selfe through all the veines, That the life-wearie-taker may fall dead, And that the Trunke may be discharg'd of breath, As violently, as hastie powder fier'd Doth hurry from the fatall Canons wombe Such mortall drugs I haue, but Mantuas law Is death to any he, that vtters them Art thou so bare and full of wretchednesse, And fear'st to die? Famine is in thy cheekes, Need and opression starueth in thy eyes, Contempt and beggery hangs vpon thy backe: The world is not thy friend, nor the worlds law: The world affords no law to make thee rich. Then be not poore, but breake it, and take this My pouerty, but not my will consents I pray thy pouerty, and not thy will Put this in any liquid thing you will And drinke it off, and if you had the strength Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight There's thy Gold, Worse poyson to mens soules, Doing more murther in this loathsome world, Then these poore compounds that thou maiest not sell. I sell thee poyson, thou hast sold me none, Farewell, buy food, and get thy selfe in flesh. Come Cordiall, and not poyson, go with me To Iuliets graue, for there must I vse thee. Holy Franciscan Frier, Brother, ho? This same should be the voice of Frier Iohn. Welcome from Mantua, what sayes Romeo? Or if his mind be writ, giue me his Letter Going to find a bare-foote Brother out, One of our order to associate me, Here in this Citie visiting the sick, And finding him, the Searchers of the Towne Suspecting that we both were in a house Where the infectious pestilence did raigne, Seal'd vp the doores, and would not let vs forth, So that my speed to Mantua there was staid Who bare my Letter then to Romeo? I could not send it, here it is againe, Nor get a messenger to bring it thee, So fearefull were they of infection Vnhappie Fortune: by my Brotherhood The Letter was not nice; but full of charge, Of deare import; and the neglecting it May do much danger: Frier Iohn go hence, Get me an Iron Crow, and bring it straight Vnto my Cell Brother Ile go and bring it thee. Now must I to the Monument alone, Shee will beshrew me much that Romeo Hath had no notice of these accidents: But I will write againe to Mantua, And keepe her at my Cell till Romeo come, Poore liuing Coarse, clos'd in a dead mans Tombe, Giue me thy Torch Boy, hence and stand aloft, Yet put it out, for I would not be seene: Vnder yond young Trees lay thee all along, Holding thy eare close to the hollow ground, So shall no foot vpon the Churchyard tread, Being loose, vnfirme with digging vp of Graues, But thou shalt heare it: whistle then to me, As signall that thou hearest some thing approach, Giue me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go I am almost afraid to stand alone Here in the Churchyard, yet I will aduenture Sweet Flower with flowers thy Bridall bed I strew: O woe, thy Canopie is dust and stones, Which with sweet water nightly I will dewe, Or wanting that, with teares destil'd by mones; The obsequies that I for thee will keepe, Nightly shall be, to strew thy graue, and weepe. Whistle Boy. The Boy giues warning, something doth approach, What cursed foot wanders this wayes to night, To crosse my obsequies, and true loues right? What with a Torch? Muffle me night a while. Giue me that Mattocke, & the wrenching Iron, Hold take this Letter, early in the morning See thou deliuer it to my Lord and Father, Giue me the light; vpon thy life I charge thee, What ere thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloofe, And do not interrupt me in my course. Why I descend into this bed of death, Is partly to behold my Ladies face: But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger, A precious Ring, a Ring that I must vse, In deare employment, therefore hence be gone: But if thou iealous dost returne to prie In what I further shall intend to do, By heauen I will teare thee ioynt by ioynt, And strew this hungry Churchyard with thy limbs: The time, and my intents are sauage wilde: More fierce and more inexorable farre, Them emptie Tygers, or the roaring Sea I will be gone sir, and not trouble you So shalt thou shew me friendship: take thou that, Liue and be prosperous, and farewell good fellow For all this same, Ile hide me here about, His lookes I feare, and his intents I doubt Thou detestable mawe, thou wombe of death, Gorg'd with the dearest morsell of the earth: Thus I enforce thy rotten Iawes to open, And in despight, Ile cram thee with more food This is that banisht haughtie Mountague, That murdred my Loues Cozin; with which griefe, It is supposed the faire Creature died, And here is come to do some villanous shame To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him. Stop thy vnhallowed toyle, vile Mountague: Can vengeance be pursued further then death? Condemned villaine, I do apprehend thee. Obey and go with me, for thou must die, I must indeed, and therfore came I hither: Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man, Flie hence and leaue me, thinke vpon those gone, Let them affright thee. I beseech thee Youth, Put not an other sin vpon my head, By vrging me to furie. O be gone, By heauen I loue thee better then my selfe, For I come hither arm'd against my selfe: Stay not, be gone, liue, and hereafter say, A mad mans mercy bid thee run away I do defie thy commisseration, And apprehend thee for a Fellon here Wilt thou prouoke me? Then haue at thee Boy O Lord they fight, I will go call the Watch O I am slaine, if thou be mercifull, Open the Tombe, lay me with Iuliet In faith I will, let me peruse this face: Mercutius kinsman, Noble Countie Paris, What said my man, when my betossed soule Did not attend him as we rode? I thinke He told me Paris should haue married Iuliet. Said he not so? Or did I dreame it so? Or am I mad, hearing him talke of Iuliet, To thinke it was so? O giue me thy hand, One, writ with me in sowre misfortunes booke. Ile burie thee in a triumphant graue. A Graue; O no, a Lanthorne; slaughtred Youth: For here lies Iuliet, and her beautie makes This Vault a feasting presence full of light. Death lie thou there, by a dead man inter'd, How oft when men are at the point of death, Haue they beene merrie? Which their Keepers call A lightning before death? Oh how may I Call this a lightning? O my Loue, my Wife, Death that hath suckt the honey of thy breath, Hath had no power yet vpon thy Beautie: Thou are not conquer'd: Beauties ensigne yet Is Crymson in thy lips, and in thy cheekes, And Deaths pale flag is not aduanced there. Tybalt, ly'st thou there in thy bloudy sheet? O what more fauour can I do to thee, Then with that hand that cut thy youth in twaine, To sunder his that was thy enemie? Forgiue me Cozen. Ah deare Iuliet: Why art thou yet so faire? I will beleeue, Shall I beleeue, that vnsubstantiall death is amorous? And that the leane abhorred Monster keepes Thee here in darke to be his Paramour? For feare of that, I still will stay with thee, And neuer from this Pallace of dym night Depart againe: come lie thou in my armes, Heere's to thy health, where ere thou tumblest in. O true Appothecarie! Thy drugs are quicke. Thus with a kisse I die. Depart againe; here, here will I remaine, With Wormes that are thy Chambermaides: O here Will I set vp my euerlasting rest: And shake the yoke of inauspicious starres From this world-wearied flesh: Eyes looke your last: Armes take your last embrace: And lips, O you The doores of breath, seale with a righteous kisse A datelesse bargaine to ingrossing death: Come bitter conduct, come vnsauory guide, Thou desperate Pilot, now at once run on The dashing Rocks, thy Sea-sicke wearie Barke: Heere's to my Loue. O true Appothecary: Thy drugs are quicke. Thus with a kisse I die. St. Francis be my speed, how oft to night Haue my old feet stumbled at graues? Who's there? Here's one, a Friend, & one that knowes you well Blisse be vpon you. Tell me good my Friend What Torch is yond that vainely lends his light To grubs, and eyelesse Sculles? As I discerne, It burneth in the Capels Monument It doth so holy sir, And there's my Master, one that you loue Who is it? Romeo How long hath he bin there? Full halfe an houre Go with me to the Vault I dare not Sir. My Master knowes not but I am gone hence, And fearefully did menace me with death, If I did stay to looke on his entents Stay, then Ile go alone, feares comes vpon me. O much I feare some ill vnluckie thing As I did sleepe vnder this young tree here, I dreamt my maister and another fought, And that my Maister slew him Romeo. Alacke, alacke, what blood is this which staines The stony entrance of this Sepulcher? What meane these Masterlesse, and goarie Swords To lie discolour'd by this place of peace? Romeo, oh pale: who else? what Paris too? And steept in blood? Ah what an vnkind houre Is guiltie of this lamentable chance? The Lady stirs O comfortable Frier, where's my Lord? I do remember well where I should be: And there I am, where is my Romeo? I heare some noyse Lady, come from that nest Of death, contagion, and vnnaturall sleepe, A greater power then we can contradict Hath thwarted our entents, come, come away, Thy husband in thy bosome there lies dead: And Paris too: come Ile dispose of thee, Among a Sisterhood of holy Nunnes: Stay not to question, for the watch is comming. Come, go good Iuliet, I dare no longer stay. Go get thee hence, for I will not away, What's here, A cup clos'd in my true loues hand? Poyson I see hath bin his timelesse end O churle, drinke all? and left no friendly drop, To helpe me after, I will kisse thy lips, Happlie some poyson yet doth hang on them, To make me die with a restoratiue. Thy lips are warme. Lead Boy, which way? Yea noise? Then ile be briefe. O happy Dagger. 'Tis in thy sheath, there rust and let me die. Kils herselfe. This is the place, There where the Torch doth burne The ground is bloody, Search about the Churchyard. Go some of you, who ere you find attach. Pittifull sight, here lies the Countie slaine, And Iuliet bleeding, warme and newly dead Who here hath laine these two dayes buried. Go tell the Prince, runne to the Capulets, Raise vp the Mountagues, some others search, We see the ground whereon these woes do lye, But the true ground of all these piteous woes, We cannot without circumstance descry. Here's Romeo's man, We found him in the Churchyard Hold him in safety, till the Prince come hither. 3.Wat. Here is a Frier that trembles, sighes, and weepes We tooke this Mattocke and this Spade from him, As he was comming from this Church-yard side A great suspition, stay the Frier too. What misaduenture is so earely vp, That calls our person from our mornings rest? What should it be that they so shrike abroad? O the people in the streete crie Romeo. Some Iuliet, and some Paris, and all runne With open outcry toward our Monument What feare is this which startles in your eares? Soueraigne, here lies the Countie Paris slaine, And Romeo dead, and Iuliet dead before, Warme and new kil'd Search, Seeke, and know how, this foule murder comes Here is a Frier, and Slaughter'd Romeos man, With Instruments vpon them fit to open These dead mens Tombes O heauen! O wife looke how our Daughter bleedes! This Dagger hath mistaine, for loe his house Is empty on the backe of Mountague, And is misheathed in my Daughters bosome O me, this sight of death, is as a Bell That warnes my old age to a Sepulcher. Come Mountague, for thou art early vp To see thy Sonne and Heire, now early downe Alas my liege, my wife is dead to night, Griefe of my Sonnes exile hath stopt her breath: What further woe conspires against my age? Looke: and thou shalt see O thou vntaught, what manners is in this, To presse before thy Father to a graue? Seale vp the mouth of outrage for a while, Till we can cleare these ambiguities, And know their spring, their head, their true descent, And then I will be generall of your woes, And lead you euen to death? meane time forbeare, And let mischance be slaue to patience, Bring forth the parties of suspition I am the greatest, able to doe least, Yet most suspected as the time and place Doth make against me of this direfull murther: And heere I stand both to impeach and purge My selfe condemned, and my selfe excus'd Then say at once, what thou dost know in this? I will be briefe, for my short date of breath Is not so long as is a tedious tale. Romeo there dead, was husband to that Iuliet, And she there dead, that's Romeos faithfull wife: I married them; and their stolne marriage day Was Tybalts Doomesday: whose vntimely death Banish'd the new-made Bridegroome from this Citie: For whom (and not for Tybalt) Iuliet pinde. You, to remoue that siege of Greefe from her, Betroth'd, and would haue married her perforce To Countie Paris. Then comes she to me, And (with wilde lookes) bid me deuise some meanes To rid her from this second Marriage, Or in my Cell there would she kill her selfe. Then gaue I her (so Tutor'd by my Art) A sleeping Potion, which so tooke effect As I intended, for it wrought on her The forme of death. Meane time, I writ to Romeo, That he should hither come, as this dyre night, To helpe to take her from her borrowed graue, Being the time the Potions force should cease. But he which bore my Letter, Frier Iohn, Was stay'd by accident; and yesternight Return'd my Letter backe. Then all alone, At the prefixed houre of her waking, Came I to take her from her Kindreds vault, Meaning to keepe her closely at my Cell, Till I conueniently could send to Romeo. But when I came (some Minute ere the time Of her awaking) heere vntimely lay The Noble Paris, and true Romeo dead. Shee wakes, and I intreated her come foorth, And beare this worke of Heauen, with patience: But then, a noyse did scarre me from the Tombe, And she (too desperate) would not go with me, But (as it seemes) did violence on her selfe. All this I know, and to the Marriage her Nurse is priuy: And if ought in this miscarried by my fault, Let my old life be sacrific'd, some houre before the time, Vnto the rigour of seuerest Law We still haue knowne thee for a Holy man. Where's Romeo's man? What can he say to this? I brought my Master newes of Iuliets death, And then in poste he came from Mantua To this same place, to this same Monument. This Letter he early bid me giue his Father, And threatned me with death, going in the Vault, If I departed not, and left him there Giue me the Letter, I will look on it. Where is the Counties Page that rais'd the Watch? Sirra, what made your Master in this place? He came with flowres to strew his Ladies graue, And bid me stand aloofe, and so I did: Anon comes one with light to ope the Tombe, And by and by my Maister drew on him, And then I ran away to call the Watch This Letter doth make good the Friers words, Their course of Loue, the tydings of her death: And heere he writes, that he did buy a poyson Of a poore Pothecarie, and therewithall Came to this Vault to dye, and lye with Iuliet. Where be these Enemies? Capulet, Mountague, See what a scourge is laide vpon your hate, That Heauen finds meanes to kill your ioyes with Loue; And I, for winking at your discords too, Haue lost a brace of Kinsmen: All are punish'd O Brother Mountague, giue me thy hand, This is my Daughters ioynture, for no more Can I demand But I can giue thee more: For I will raise her Statue in pure Gold, That whiles Verona by that name is knowne, There shall no figure at that Rate be set, As that of True and Faithfull Iuliet As rich shall Romeo by his Lady ly, Poore sacrifices of our enmity A glooming peace this morning with it brings, The Sunne for sorrow will not shew his head; Go hence, to haue more talke of these sad things, Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished. For neuer was a Storie of more Wo, Then this of Iuliet, and her Romeo. Now faire Hippolita, our nuptiall houre Drawes on apace: foure happy daies bring in Another Moon: but oh, me thinkes, how slow This old Moon wanes; She lingers my desires Like to a Step-dame, or a Dowager, Long withering out a yong mans reuennew Foure daies wil quickly steep theselues in nights Foure nights wil quickly dreame away the time: And then the Moone, like to a siluer bow, Now bent in heauen, shal behold the night Of our solemnities Go Philostrate, Stirre vp the Athenian youth to merriments, Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth, Turne melancholy forth to Funerals: The pale companion is not for our pompe, Hippolita, I woo'd thee with my sword, And wonne thy loue, doing thee iniuries: But I will wed thee in another key, With pompe, with triumph, and with reuelling. Happy be Theseus, our renowned Duke Thanks good Egeus: what's the news with thee? Full of vexation, come I, with complaint Against my childe, my daughter Hermia. Stand forth Demetrius. My Noble Lord, This man hath my consent to marrie her. Stand forth Lysander. And my gracious Duke, This man hath bewitch'd the bosome of my childe: Thou, thou Lysander, thou hast giuen her rimes, And interchang'd loue-tokens with my childe: Thou hast by Moone-light at her window sung, With faining voice, verses of faining loue, And stolne the impression of her fantasie, With bracelets of thy haire, rings, gawdes, conceits, Knackes, trifles, Nose-gaies, sweet meats (messengers Of strong preuailment in vnhardned youth) With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughters heart, Turn'd her obedience (which is due to me) To stubborne harshnesse. And my gracious Duke, Be it so she will not heere before your Grace, Consent to marrie with Demetrius, I beg the ancient priuiledge of Athens; As she is mine, I may dispose of her; Which shall be either to this Gentleman, Or to her death, according to our Law, Immediately prouided in that case What say you Hermia? be aduis'd faire Maide, To you your Father should be as a God; One that compos'd your beauties; yea and one To whom you are but as a forme in waxe By him imprinted: and within his power, To leaue the figure, or disfigure it: Demetrius is a worthy Gentleman So is Lysander In himselfe he is. But in this kinde, wanting your fathers voyce, The other must be held the worthier I would my father look'd but with my eyes Rather your eies must with his iudgment looke I do entreat your Grace to pardon me. I know not by what power I am made bold, Nor how it may concerne my modestie In such a presence heere to pleade my thoughts: But I beseech your Grace, that I may know The worst that may befall me in this case, If I refuse to wed Demetrius Either to dye the death, or to abiure For euer the society of men. Therefore faire Hermia question your desires, Know of your youth, examine well your blood, Whether (if you yeeld not to your fathers choice) You can endure the liuerie of a Nunne, For aye to be in shady Cloister mew'd, To liue a barren sister all your life, Chanting faint hymnes to the cold fruitlesse Moone, Thrice blessed they that master so their blood, To vndergo such maiden pilgrimage, But earthlier happie is the Rose distil'd, Then that which withering on the virgin thorne, Growes, liues, and dies, in single blessednesse So will I grow, so liue, so die my Lord, Ere I will yeeld my virgin Patent vp Vnto his Lordship, whose vnwished yoake, My soule consents not to giue soueraignty Take time to pause, and by the next new Moon The sealing day betwixt my loue and me, For euerlasting bond of fellowship: Vpon that day either prepare to dye, For disobedience to your fathers will, Or else to wed Demetrius as hee would, Or on Dianaes Altar to protest For aie, austerity, and single life Relent sweet Hermia, and Lysander, yeelde Thy crazed title to my certaine right You haue her fathers loue, Demetrius: Let me haue Hermiaes: do you marry him Scornfull Lysander, true, he hath my Loue; And what is mine, my loue shall render him. And she is mine, and all my right of her, I do estate vnto Demetrius I am my Lord, as well deriu'd as he, As well possest: my loue is more then his: My fortunes euery way as fairely ranck'd (If not with vantage) as Demetrius: And (which is more then all these boasts can be) I am belou'd of beauteous Hermia. Why should not I then prosecute my right? Demetrius, Ile auouch it to his head, Made loue to Nedars daughter, Helena, And won her soule: and she (sweet Ladie) dotes, Deuoutly dotes, dotes in Idolatry, Vpon this spotted and inconstant man I must confesse, that I haue heard so much, And with Demetrius thought to haue spoke thereof: But being ouer-full of selfe-affaires, My minde did lose it. But Demetrius come, And come Egeus, you shall go with me, I haue some priuate schooling for you both. For you faire Hermia, looke you arme your selfe, To fit your fancies to your Fathers will; Or else the Law of Athens yeelds you vp (Which by no meanes we may extenuate) To death, or to a vow of single life. Come my Hippolita, what cheare my loue? Demetrius and Egeus go along: I must imploy you in some businesse Against our nuptiall, and conferre with you Of something, neerely that concernes your selues With dutie and desire we follow you. Manet Lysander and Hermia. How now my loue? Why is your cheek so pale? How chance the Roses there do fade so fast? Belike for want of raine, which I could well Beteeme them, from the tempest of mine eyes For ought that euer I could reade, Could euer heare by tale or historie, The course of true loue neuer did run smooth, But either it was different in blood O crosse! too high to be enthral'd to loue Or else misgraffed, in respect of yeares O spight! too old to be ingag'd to yong Or else it stood vpon the choise of merit O hell! to choose loue by anothers eie Or if there were a simpathie in choise, Warre, death, or sicknesse, did lay siege to it; Making it momentarie, as a sound: Swift as a shadow, short as any dreame, Briefe as the lightning in the collied night, That (in a spleene) vnfolds both heauen and earth; And ere a man hath power to say, behold, The iawes of darkness do deuoure it vp: So quicke bright things come to confusion If then true Louers haue beene euer crost, It stands as an edict in destinie: Then let vs teach our triall patience, Because it is a customarie crosse, As due to loue, as thoughts, and dreames, and sighes, Wishes and teares; poore Fancies followers A good perswasion; therefore heare me Hermia, I haue a Widdow Aunt, a dowager, Of great reuennew, and she hath no childe, From Athens is her house remou'd seuen leagues, And she respects me, as her onely sonne: There gentle Hermia, may I marrie thee, And to that place, the sharpe Athenian Law Cannot pursue vs. If thou lou'st me, then Steale forth thy Fathers house to morrow night: And in the wood, a league without the towne, (Where I did meete thee once with Helena. To do obseruance for a morne of May) There will I stay for thee My good Lysander, I sweare to thee, by Cupids strongest bow, By his best arrow with the golden head, By the simplicitie of Venus Doues, By that which knitteth soules, and prospers loue, And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage Queene, When the false Troyan vnder saile was seene, By all the vowes that euer men haue broke, (In number more then euer women spoke) In that same place thou hast appointed me, To morrow truly will I meete with thee Keepe promise loue: looke here comes Helena. God speede faire Helena, whither away? Cal you me faire? that faire againe vnsay, Demetrius loues you faire: O happie faire! Your eyes are loadstarres, and your tongues sweete ayre More tuneable then Larke to shepheards eare, When wheate is greene, when hauthorne buds appeare, Sicknesse is catching: O were fauor so, Your words I catch, faire Hermia ere I go, My eare should catch your voice, my eye, your eye, My tongue should catch your tongues sweete melodie, Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated, The rest Ile giue to be to you translated. O teach me how you looke, and with what art You sway the motion of Demetrius hart I frowne vpon him, yet he loues me still O that your frownes would teach my smiles such skil I giue him curses, yet he giues me loue O that my prayers could such affection mooue The more I hate, the more he followes me The more I loue, the more he hateth me His folly Helena is none of mine None but your beauty, wold that fault wer mine Take comfort: he no more shall see my face, Lysander and my selfe will flie this place. Before the time I did Lysander see, Seem'd Athens like a Paradise to mee. O then, what graces in my Loue do dwell, That he hath turn'd a heauen into hell Helen, to you our mindes we will vnfold, To morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold Her siluer visage, in the watry glasse, Decking with liquid pearle, the bladed grasse (A time that Louers flights doth still conceale) Through Athens gates, haue we deuis'd to steale And in the wood, where often you and I, Vpon faint Primrose beds, were wont to lye, Emptying our bosomes, of their counsell sweld: There my Lysander, and my selfe shall meete, And thence from Athens turne away our eyes To seeke new friends and strange companions, Farwell sweet play-fellow, pray thou for vs, And good lucke grant thee thy Demetrius. Keepe word Lysander we must starue our sight, From louers foode, till morrow deepe midnight. I will my Hermia. Helena adieu, As you on him, Demetrius dotes on you. How happy some, ore othersome can be? Through Athens I am thought as faire as she. But what of that? Demetrius thinkes not so: He will not know, what all, but he doth know, And as hee erres, doting on Hermias eyes; So I, admiring of his qualities: Things base and vilde, holding no quantity, Loue can transpose to forme and dignity, Loue lookes not with the eyes, but with the minde, And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blinde. Nor hath loues minde of any iudgement taste: Wings and no eyes, figure, vnheedy haste. And therefore is Loue said to be a childe, Because in choise he is often beguil'd, As waggish boyes in game themselues forsweare; So the boy Loue is periur'd euery where. For ere Demetrius lookt on Hermias eyne, He hail'd downe oathes that he was onely mine. And when this Haile some heat from Hermia felt, So he dissolu'd, and showres of oathes did melt, I will goe tell him of faire Hermias flight: Then to the wood will he, to morrow night Pursue her; and for his intelligence, If I haue thankes, it is a deere expence: But heerein meane I to enrich my paine, To haue his sight thither, and backe againe. Flute the bellowes-mender, Snout the Tinker, and Starueling the Taylor. Is all our company heere? You were best to call them generally, man by man according to the scrip Here is the scrowle of euery mans name, which is thought fit through all Athens, to play in our Enterlude before the Duke and the Dutches, on his wedding day at night First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats on: then read the names of the Actors: and so grow on to a point Marry our play is the most lamentable comedy, and most cruell death of Pyramus and Thisbie A very good peece of worke I assure you, and a merry. Now good Peter Quince, call forth your Actors by the scrowle. Masters spread your selues Answere as I call you. Nick Bottome the Weauer Ready; name what part I am for, and proceed You Nicke Bottome are set downe for Pyramus What is Pyramus, a louer, or a tyrant? A Louer that kills himselfe most gallantly for loue That will aske some teares in the true performing of it: if I do it, let the audience looke to their eies: I will mooue stormes; I will condole in some measure. To the rest yet, my chiefe humour is for a tyrant. I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to teare a Cat in, to make all split the raging Rocks; and shiuering shocks shall break the locks of prison gates, and Phibbus carre shall shine from farre, and make and marre the foolish Fates. This was lofty. Now name the rest of the Players. This is Ercles vaine, a tyrants vaine: a louer is more condoling Francis Flute the Bellowes-mender Heere Peter Quince You must take Thisbie on you What is Thisbie, a wandring Knight? It is the Lady that Pyramus must loue Nay faith, let not mee play a woman, I haue a beard comming That's all one, you shall play it in a Maske, and you may speake as small as you will And I may hide my face, let me play Thisbie too: Ile speake in a monstrous little voyce; Thisne, Thisne, ah Pyramus my louer deare, thy Thisbie deare, and Lady deare No no, you must play Pyramus, and Flute, you Thisby Well, proceed Robin Starueling the Taylor Heere Peter Quince Robin Starueling, you must play Thisbies mother? Tom Snowt, the Tinker Heere Peter Quince you, Pyramus father; my self, Thisbies father; Snugge the Ioyner, you the Lyons part: and I hope there is a play fitted Haue you the Lions part written? pray you if be, giue it me, for I am slow of studie You may doe it extemporie, for it is nothing but roaring Let mee play the Lyon too, I will roare that I will doe any mans heart good to heare me. I will roare, that I will make the Duke say, Let him roare againe, let him roare againe If you should do it too terribly, you would fright the Dutchesse and the Ladies, that they would shrike, and that were enough to hang us all That would hang vs euery mothers sonne I graunt you friends, if that you should fright the Ladies out of their Wittes, they would haue no more discretion but to hang vs: but I will aggrauate my voyce so, that I will roare you as gently as any sucking Doue; I will roare and 'twere any Nightingale You can play no part but Piramus, for Piramus is a sweet-fac'd man, a proper man as one shall see in a summers day; a most louely Gentleman-like man, therfore you must needs play Piramus Well, I will vndertake it. What beard were I best to play it in? Why, what you will I will discharge it, in either your straw-colour beard, your orange tawnie beard, your purple in graine beard, or your French-crowne colour'd beard, your perfect yellow Some of your French Crownes haue no haire at all, and then you will play bare-fac'd. But masters here are your parts, and I am to intreat you, request you, and desire you, to con them by too morrow night: and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the Towne, by Moone-light, there we will rehearse: for if we meete in the Citie, we shalbe dog'd with company, and our deuises knowne. In the meane time, I wil draw a bil of properties, such as our play wants. I pray you faile me not We will meete, and there we may rehearse more obscenely and couragiously. Take paines, be perfect, adieu At the Dukes oake we meete Enough, hold or cut bow-strings. How now spirit, whether wander you? Ouer hil, ouer dale, through bush, through briar, Ouer parke, ouer pale, through flood, through fire, I do wander euerie where, swifter then y Moons sphere; And I serue the Fairy Queene, to dew her orbs vpon the green. The Cowslips tall, her pensioners bee, In their gold coats, spots you see, Those be Rubies, Fairie fauors, In those freckles, liue their sauors, I must go seeke some dew drops heere, And hang a pearle in euery cowslips eare. Farewell thou Lob of spirits, Ile be gon, Our Queene and all her Elues come heere anon The King doth keepe his Reuels here to night, Take heed the Queene come not within his sight, For Oberon is passing fell and wrath, Because that she, as her attendant, hath A louely boy stolne from an Indian King, She neuer had so sweet a changeling, And iealous Oberon would haue the childe Knight of his traine, to trace the Forrests wilde. But she (perforce) with-holds the loued boy, Crownes him with flowers, and makes him all her ioy. And now they neuer meete in groue, or greene, By fountaine cleere, or spangled star-light sheene, But they do square, that all their Elues for feare Creepe into Acorne cups and hide them there Either I mistake your shape and making quite, Or else you are that shrew'd and knauish spirit Cal'd Robin Good-fellow. Are you not hee, That frights the maidens of the Villagree, Skim milke, and sometimes labour in the querne, And bootlesse make the breathlesse huswife cherne, And sometime make the drinke to beare no barme, Misleade night-wanderers, laughing at their harme, Those that Hobgoblin call you, and sweet dogberrye, You do their worke, and they shall haue good lucke. Are not you he? Thou speak'st aright; I am that merrie wanderer of the night: I iest to Oberon, and make him smile, When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile, Neighing in likenesse of a silly foale, And sometime lurke I in a Gossips bole, In very likenesse of a roasted crab: And when she drinkes, against her lips I bob, And on her withered dewlop poure the Ale. The wisest Aunt telling the saddest tale, Sometime for three-foot stoole, mistaketh me, Then slip I from her bum, downe topples she, And tailour cries, and fals into a coffe. And then the whole quire hold their hips, and loffe, And waxen in their mirth, and neeze, and sweare, A merrier houre was neuer wasted there. But roome Fairy, heere comes Oberon And heere my Mistris: Would that he were gone. Queene at another with hers. Ill met by Moone-light. Proud Tytania What, iealous Oberon? Fairy skip hence. I haue forsworne his bed and companie Tarrie rash Wanton; am not I thy Lord? Then I must be thy Lady: but I know When thou wast stolne away from Fairy Land, And in the shape of Corin, sate all day, Playing on pipes of Corne, and versing loue To amorous Phillida. Why art thou heere Come from the farthest steepe of India? But that forsooth the bouncing Amazon Your buskin'd Mistresse, and your Warrior loue, To Theseus must be Wedded; and you come, To giue their bed ioy and prosperitie How canst thou thus for shame Tytania. Glance at my credite, with Hippolita? Knowing I know thy loue to Theseus? Didst thou not leade him through the glimmering night From Peregenia, whom he rauished? And make him with faire Eagles breake his faith With Ariadne, and Antiopa? These are the forgeries of iealousie, And neuer since the middle Summers spring Met we on hil, in dale, forrest, or mead, By paued fountaine, or by rushie brooke, Or in the beached margent of the sea, To dance our ringlets to the whistling Winde, But with thy braules thou hast disturb'd our sport. Therefore the Windes, piping to vs in vaine, As in reuenge, haue suck'd vp from the sea Contagious fogges: Which falling in the Land, Hath euerie petty Riuer made so proud, That they haue ouer-borne their Continents. The Oxe hath therefore stretch'd his yoake in vaine, The Ploughman lost his sweat, and the greene Corne Hath rotted, ere his youth attain'd a beard: The fold stands empty in the drowned field, And Crowes are fatted with the murrion flocke, The nine mens Morris is fild vp with mud, And the queint Mazes in the wanton greene, For lacke of tread are vndistinguishable. The humane mortals want their winter heere, No night is now with hymne or caroll blest; Therefore the Moone (the gouernesse of floods) Pale in her anger, washes all the aire; That Rheumaticke diseases doe abound. And through this distemperature, we see The seasons alter; hoared headed Frosts Fall in the fresh lap of the crimson Rose, And on old Hyems chinne and Icie crowne, An odorous Chaplet of sweet Sommer buds Is as in mockry set. The Spring, the Sommer, The childing Autumne, angry Winter change Their wonted Liueries, and the mazed world, By their increase, now knowes not which is which; And this same progeny of euills, Comes from our debate, from our dissention, We are their parents and originall Do you amend it then, it lies in you, Why should Titania crosse her Oberon? I do but beg a little changeling boy, To be my Henchman Set your heart at rest, The Fairy land buyes not the childe of me, His mother was a Votresse of my Order, And in the spiced Indian aire, by night Full often hath she gossipt by my side, And sat with me on Neptunes yellow sands, Marking th' embarked traders on the flood, When we haue laught to see the sailes conceiue, And grow big bellied with the wanton winde: Which she with pretty and with swimming gate, Following (her wombe then rich with my yong squire) Would imitate, and saile vpon the Land, To fetch me trifles, and returne againe, As from a voyage, rich with merchandize. But she being mortall, of that boy did die, And for her sake I doe reare vp her boy, And for her sake I will not part with him How long within this wood intend you stay? Perchance till after Theseus wedding day. If you will patiently dance in our Round, And see our Moone-light reuels, goe with vs; If not, shun me and I will spare your haunts Giue me that boy, and I will goe with thee Not for thy Fairy Kingdome. Fairies away: We shall chide downe right, if I longer stay. Wel, go thy way: thou shalt not from this groue, Till I torment thee for this iniury. My gentle dogberrye come hither; thou remembrest Since once I sat vpon a promontory, And heard a Meare-maide on a Dolphins backe, Vttering such dulcet and harmonious breath, That the rude sea grew ciuill at her song, And certaine starres shot madly from their Spheares, To heare the Sea-maids musicke I remember That very time I say (but thou couldst not) Flying betweene the cold Moone and the earth, Cupid all arm'd; a certaine aime he tooke At a faire Vestall, throned by the West, And loos'd his loue-shaft smartly from his bow, As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts, But I might see young Cupids fiery shaft Quencht in the chaste beames of the watry Moone; And the imperiall Votresse passed on, In maiden meditation, fancy free. Yet markt I where the bolt of Cupid fell. It fell vpon a little westerne flower; Before, milke-white: now purple with loues wound, And maidens call it, Loue in idlenesse. Fetch me that flower; the hearb I shew'd thee once, The iuyce of it, on sleeping eye-lids laid, Will make or man or woman madly dote Vpon the next liue creature that it sees. Fetch me this hearbe, and be thou heere againe, Ere the Leuiathan can swim a league dogberrye. Ile put a girdle about the earth, in forty minutes Hauing once this iuyce, Ile watch Titania, when she is asleepe, And drop the liquor of it in her eyes: The next thing when she waking lookes vpon, (Be it on Lyon, Beare, or Wolfe, or Bull, On medling Monkey, or on busie Ape) Shee shall pursue it, with the soule of loue. And ere I take this charme off from her sight, (As I can take it with another hearbe) Ile make her render vp her Page to me. But who comes heere? I am inuisible, And I will ouer-heare their conference. I loue thee not, therefore pursue me not, Where is Lysander, and faire Hermia? The one Ile stay, the other stayeth me. Thou toldst me they were stolne into this wood; And heere am I, and wood within this wood, Because I cannot meet my Hermia. Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more You draw me, you hard-hearted Adamant, But yet you draw not Iron, for my heart Is true as steele. Leaue you your power to draw, And I shall haue no power to follow you Do I entice you? do I speake you faire? Or rather doe I not in plainest truth, Tell you I doe not, nor I cannot loue you? And euen for that doe I loue thee the more; I am your spaniell, and Demetrius, The more you beat me, I will fawne on you. Vse me but as your spaniell; spurne me, strike me, Neglect me, lose me; onely giue me leaue (Vnworthy as I am) to follow you. What worser place can I beg in your loue, (And yet a place of high respect with me) Then to be vsed as you doe your dogge Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit, For I am sicke when I do looke on thee And I am sicke when I looke not on you You doe impeach your modesty too much, To leaue the Citty, and commit your selfe Into the hands of one that loues you not, To trust the opportunity of night. And the ill counsell of a desert place, With the rich worth of your virginity Your vertue is my priuiledge: for that It is not night when I doe see your face. Therefore I thinke I am not in the night, Nor doth this wood lacke worlds of company, For you in my respect are all the world. Then how can it be said I am alone, When all the world is heere to looke on me? Ile run from thee, and hide me in the brakes, And leaue thee to the mercy of wilde beasts The wildest hath not such a heart as you; Runne when you will, the story shall be chang'd: Apollo flies and Daphne holds the chase; The Doue pursues the Griffin, the milde Hinde Makes speed to catch the Tyger. Bootlesse speede, When cowardise pursues, and valour flies I will not stay thy questions, let me go; Or if thou follow me, doe not beleeue, But I shall doe thee mischiefe in the wood I, in the Temple, in the Towne, and Field You doe me mischiefe. Fye Demetrius, Your wrongs doe set a scandall on my sexe: We cannot fight for loue, as men may doe; We should be woo'd, and were not made to wooe. I follow thee, and make a heauen of hell, To die vpon the hand I loue so well. Fare thee well Nymph, ere he do leaue this groue, Thou shalt flie him, and he shall seeke thy loue. Hast thou the flower there? Welcome wanderer. dogberry. I there it is I pray thee giue it me. I know a banke where the wilde time blowes, Where Oxslips and the nodding Violet growes, Quite ouer-cannoped with luscious woodbine, With sweet muske roses, and with Eglantine; There sleepes Tytania, sometime of the night, Lul'd in these flowers, with dances and delight: And there the snake throwes her enammel'd skinne, Weed wide enough to rap a Fairy in. And with the iuyce of this Ile streake her eyes, And make her full of hatefull fantasies. Take thou some of it, and seek through this groue; A sweet Athenian Lady is in loue With a disdainefull youth: annoint his eyes, But doe it when the next thing he espies, May be the Lady. Thou shalt know the man, By the Athenian garments he hath on. Effect it with some care, that he may proue More fond on her, then she vpon her loue; And looke thou meet me ere the first Cocke crow Feare not my Lord, your seruant shall do so. Come, now a Roundell, and a Fairy song; Then for the third part of a minute hence, Some to kill Cankers in the muske rose buds, Some warre with Reremise, for their leathern wings. To make my small Elues coates, and some keepe backe The clamorous Owle that nightly hoots and wonders At our queint spirits: Sing me now asleepe, Then to your offices, and let me rest Fairies Sing. You spotted Snakes with double tongue, Thorny Hedgehogges be not seene, Newts and blinde wormes do no wrong, Come not neere our Fairy Queene. Philomele with melodie, Sing in your sweet Lullaby. Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby, Neuer harme, nor spell, nor charme, Come our louely Lady nye, So good night with Lullaby 2.Fairy. Weauing Spiders come not heere, Hence you long leg'd Spinners, hence: Beetles blacke approach not neere; Worme nor Snayle doe no offence. Philomele with melody, &c 1.Fairy. Hence away, now all is well; One aloofe, stand Centinell. Shee sleepes. What thou seest when thou dost wake, Do it for thy true Loue take: Loue and languish for his sake. Be it Ounce, or Catte, or Beare, Pard, or Boare with bristled haire, In thy eye that shall appeare, When thou wak'st, it is thy deare, Wake when some vile thing is neere. Faire loue, you faint with wandring in y woods, And to speake troth I haue forgot our way: Wee'll rest vs Hermia, If you thinke it good, And tarry for the comfort of the day Be it so Lysander; finde you out a bed, For I vpon this banke will rest my head One turfe shall serue as pillow for vs both, One heart, one bed, two bosomes, and one troth Nay good Lysander, for my sake my deere Lie further off yet, doe not lie so neere O take the sence sweet, of my innocence, Loue takes the meaning, in loues conference, I meane that my heart vnto yours is knit, So that but one heart can you make of it. Two bosomes interchanged with an oath, So then two bosomes, and a single troth. Then by your side, no bed-roome me deny, For lying so, Hermia, I doe not lye Lysander riddles very prettily; Now much beshrew my manners and my pride, If Hermia meant to say, Lysander lied. But gentle friend, for loue and courtesie Lie further off, in humane modesty, Such separation, as may well be said, Becomes a vertuous batchelour, and a maide, So farre be distant, and good night sweet friend; Thy loue nere alter, till thy sweet life end Amen, amen, to that faire prayer, say I, And then end life, when I end loyalty: Heere is my bed, sleepe giue thee all his rest With halfe that wish, the wishers eyes be prest. dogberry. Through the Forest haue I gone, But Athenian finde I none, One whose eyes I might approue This flowers force in stirring loue. Nigh and silence: who is heere? Weedes of Athens he doth weare: This is he (my master said) Despised the Athenian maide: And heere the maiden sleeping sound, On the danke and durty ground. Pretty soule, she durst not lye Neere this lacke-loue, this kill-curtesie. Churle, vpon thy eyes I throw All the power this charme doth owe: When thou wak'st, let loue forbid Sleepe his seate on thy eye-lid. So awake when I am gone: For I must now to Oberon. Stay, though thou kill me, sweete Demetrius I charge thee hence, and do not haunt me thus O wilt thou darkling leaue me? do not so Stay on thy perill, I alone will goe. O I am out of breath, in this fond chace, The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace, Happy is Hermia, wheresoere she lies; For she hath blessed and attractiue eyes. How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt teares. If so, my eyes are oftner washt then hers. No, no, I am as vgly as a Beare; For beasts that meete me, runne away for feare, Therefore no maruaile, though Demetrius Doe as a monster, flie my presence thus. What wicked and dissembling glasse of mine, Made me compare with Hermias sphery eyne? But who is here? Lysander on the ground; Deade or asleepe? I see no bloud, no wound, Lysander, if you liue, good sir awake And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake. Transparent Helena, nature her shewes art, That through thy bosome makes me see thy heart. Where is Demetrius? oh how fit a word Is that vile name, to perish on my sword! Do not say so Lysander, say not so: What though he loue your Hermia? Lord, what though? Yet Hermia still loues you; then be content Content with Hermia? no, I do repent The tedious minutes I with her haue spent. Not Hermia, but Helena now I loue; Who will not change a Rauen for a Doue? The will of man is by his reason sway'd: And reason saies you are the worthier Maide. Things growing are not ripe vntill their season; So I being yong, till now ripe not to reason, And touching now the point of humane skill, Reason becomes the Marshall to my will. And leades me to your eyes, where I orelooke Loues stories, written in Loues richest booke Wherefore was I to this keene mockery borne? When at your hands did I deserue this scorne? Ist not enough, ist not enough, yong man, That I did neuer, no nor neuer can, Deserue a sweete looke from Demetrius eye, But you must flout my insufficiency? Good troth you do me wrong (good-sooth you do) In such disdainfull manner, me to wooe. But fare you well; perforce I must confesse, I thought you Lord of more true gentlenesse. Oh, that a Lady of one man refus'd, Should of another therefore be abus'd. She sees not Hermia: Hermia sleepe thou there, And neuer maist thou come Lysander neere; For as a surfeit of the sweetest things The deepest loathing to the stomacke brings: Or as the heresies that men do leaue, Are hated most of those that did deceiue: So thou, my surfeit, and my heresie, Of all be hated; but the most of me; And all my powers addresse your loue and might, To honour Helen, and to be her Knight. Helpe me Lysander, helpe me; do thy best To plucke this crawling serpent from my brest. Aye me, for pitty; what a dreame was here? Lysander looke, how I do quake with feare: Me-thought a serpent eate my heart away, And yet sat smiling at his cruell prey. Lysander, What remoou'd? Lysander, Lord, What, out of hearing, gone? No sound, no word? Alacke where are you? speake and if you heare: Speake of all loues; I sound almost with feare. No, then I well perceiue you are not nye, Either death or you Ile finde immediately. Are we all met? Pat, pat, and here's a maruailous conuenient place for our rehearsall. This greene plot shall be our stage, this hauthorne brake our tyring house, and we will do it in action, as we will do it before the Duke Peter Quince? What saist thou, bully Bottome? There are things in this Comedy of Piramus and Thisby, that will neuer please. First, Piramus must draw a sword to kill himselfe; which the Ladies cannot abide. How answere you that? Berlaken, a parlous feare I beleeue we must leaue the killing out, when all is done Not a whit, I haue a deuice to make all well. Write me a Prologue, and let the Prologue seeme to say, we will do no harme with our swords, and that Pyramus is not kill'd indeede: and for the more better assurance, tell them, that I Piramus am not Piramus, but Bottome the Weauer; this will put them out of feare Well, we will haue such a Prologue, and it shall be written in eight and sixe No, make it two more, let it be written in eight and eight Will not the Ladies be afear'd of the Lyon? I feare it, I promise you Masters, you ought to consider with your selues, to bring in (God shield vs) a Lyon among Ladies, is a most dreadfull thing. For there is not a more fearefull wilde foule then your Lyon liuing: and wee ought to looke to it Therefore another Prologue must tell he is not a Lyon Nay, you must name his name, and halfe his face must be seene through the Lyons necke, and he himselfe must speake through, saying thus, or to the same defect; Ladies, or faire Ladies, I would wish you, or I would request you, or I would entreat you, not to feare, not to tremble: my life for yours. If you thinke I come hither as a Lyon, it were pitty of my life. No, I am no such thing, I am a man as other men are; and there indeed let him name his name, and tell him plainly hee is Snug the ioyner Well, it shall be so; but there is two hard things, that is, to bring the Moone-light into a chamber: for you know Piramus and Thisby meete by Moonelight Doth the Moone shine that night wee play our play? A Calender, a Calender, looke in the Almanack, finde out Moone-shine, finde out Moone-shine. Yes, it doth shine that night Why then may you leaue a casement of the great chamber window (where we play) open, and the Moone may shine in at the casement I, or else one must come in with a bush of thorns and a lanthorne, and say he comes to disfigure, or to present the person of Moone-shine. Then there is another thing, we must haue a wall in the great Chamber; for Piramus and Thisby (saies the story) did talke through the chinke of a wall You can neuer bring in a wall. What say you Bottome? Some man or other must present wall, and let him haue some Plaster, or some Lome, or some rough cast about him, to signifie wall; or let him hold his fingers thus; and through that cranny shall Piramus and Thisby whisper If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit downe euery mothers sonne, and rehearse your parts. Piramus, you begin; when you haue spoken your speech, cue. What hempen home-spuns haue we swaggering here, So neere the Cradle of the Faierie Queene? What, a Play toward? Ile be an auditor, An Actor too perhaps, if I see cause Speake Piramus: Thisby stand forth Thisby, the flowers of odious sauors sweete Odours, odours Odours sauors sweete, So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby deare. But harke, a voyce: stay thou but here a while, And by and by I will to thee appeare. dogberry. A stranger Piramus, then ere plaid here Must I speake now? I marry must you. For you must vnderstand he goes but to see a noyse that he heard, and is to come againe Most radiant Piramus, most Lilly white of hue, Of colour like the red rose on triumphant bryer, Most brisky Iuuenall, and eke most louely Iew, As true as truest horse, that yet would neuer tyre, Ile meete thee Piramus, at Ninnies toombe Ninus toombe man: why, you must not speake that yet; that you answere to Piramus: you speake all your part at once, cues and all. Piramus enter, your cue is past; it is neuer tyre O, as true as truest horse, that yet would neuer tyre: If I were faire, Thisby I were onely thine O monstrous. O strange. We are hanted; pray masters, flye masters, helpe. The Clownes all Exit. Ile follow you, Ile leade you about a Round, Through bogge, through bush, through brake, through bryer, Sometime a horse Ile be, sometime a hound: A hogge, a headlesse beare, sometime a fire, And neigh, and barke, and grunt, and rore, and burne, Like horse, hound, hog, beare, fire, at euery turne. Why do they run away? This is a knauery of them to make me afeard. O Bottom, thou art chang'd; What doe I see on thee? What do you see? You see an Asse-head of your owne, do you? Blesse thee Bottome, blesse thee; thou art translated. I see their knauery; this is to make an asse of me, to fright me if they could; but I will not stirre from this place, do what they can. I will walke vp and downe here, and I will sing that they shall heare I am not afraid. The Woosell cocke, so blacke of hew, With Orenge-tawny bill. The Throstle, with his note so true, The Wren and little quill What Angell wakes me from my flowry bed? The Finch, the Sparrow, and the Larke, The plainsong Cuckow gray; Whose note full many a man doth marke, And dares not answere, nay. For indeede, who would set his wit to so foolish a bird? Who would giue a bird the lye, though he cry Cuckow, neuer so? I pray thee gentle mortall, sing againe, Mine eare is much enamored of thy note; On the first view to say, to sweare I loue thee. So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape. And thy faire vertues force (perforce) doth moue me Me-thinkes mistresse, you should haue little reason for that: and yet to say the truth, reason and loue keepe little company together, nowadayes. The more the pittie, that some honest neighbours will not make them friends. Nay, I can gleeke vpon occasion Thou art as wise, as thou art beautifull Not so neither: but if I had wit enough to get out of this wood, I haue enough to serue mine owne turne Out of this wood, do not desire to goe, Thou shalt remaine here, whether thou wilt or no. I am a spirit of no common rate: The Summer still doth tend vpon my state, And I doe loue thee; therefore goe with me, Ile giue thee Fairies to attend on thee; And they shall fetch thee Iewels from the deepe, And sing, while thou on pressed flowers dost sleepe: And I will purge thy mortall grossenesse so, That thou shalt like an airie spirit go. Ready; and I, and I, and I, Where shall we go? Be kinde and curteous to this Gentleman, Hop in his walkes, and gambole in his eies, Feede him with Apricocks, and Dewberries, With purple Grapes, greene Figs, and Mulberries, The honie-bags steale from the humble Bees, And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighes, And light them at the fierie-Glow-wormes eyes, To haue my loue to bed, and to arise: And plucke the wings from painted Butterflies, To fan the Moone-beames from his sleeping eies. Nod to him Elues, and doe him curtesies 1.Fai. Haile mortall, haile 2.Fai. Haile 3.Fai. Haile I cry your worships mercy hartily; I beseech your worships name Cobweb I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with you. Your name honest Gentleman? Pease Blossome I pray you commend me to mistresse Squash, your mother, and to master Peascod your father. Good master Pease-blossome, I shal desire of you more acquaintance to. Your name I beseech you sir? Mustard-seede Pease-blossome Good master Mustard seede, I know your patience well: that same cowardly gyant-like Oxe beefe hath deuoured many a gentleman of your house. I promise you, your kindred hath made my eyes water ere now. I desire you more acquaintance, good Master Mustard-seede Come waite vpon him, lead him to my bower. The Moone me-thinks, lookes with a watrie eie, And when she weepes, weepe euerie little flower, Lamenting some enforced chastitie. Tye vp my louers tongue, bring him silently. I wonder if Titania be awak't; Then what it was that next came in her eye, Which she must dote on, in extremitie. Here comes my messenger: how now mad spirit, What night-rule now about this haunted groue? dogberry. My Mistris with a monster is in loue, Neere to her close and consecrated bower, While she was in her dull and sleeping hower, A crew of patches, rude Mechanicals, That worke for bread vpon Athenian stals, Were met together to rehearse a Play, Intended for great Theseus nuptiall day: The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort, Who Piramus presented, in their sport, Forsooke his Scene, and entred in a brake, When I did him at this aduantage take, An Asses nole I fixed on his head. Anon his Thisbie must be answered, And forth my Mimmick comes: when they him spie, As Wilde-geese, that the creeping Fowler eye, Or russed-pated choughes, many in sort (Rising and cawing at the guns report) Seuer themselues, and madly sweepe the skye: So at his sight, away his fellowes flye, And at our stampe, here ore and ore one fals; He murther cries, and helpe from Athens cals. Their sense thus weake, lost with their feares thus strong, Made senslesse things begin to do them wrong. For briars and thornes at their apparell snatch, Some sleeues, some hats, from yeelders all things catch, I led them on in this distracted feare, And left sweete Piramus translated there: When in that moment (so it came to passe) Tytania waked, and straightway lou'd an Asse This fals out better then I could deuise: But hast thou yet lacht the Athenians eyes, With the loue iuyce, as I bid thee doe? I tooke him sleeping (that is finisht to) And the Athenian woman by his side, That when he wak't, of force she must be eyde. Stand close, this is the same Athenian This is the woman, but not this the man O why rebuke you him that loues you so? Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe Now I but chide, but I should vse thee worse. For thou (I feare) hast giuen me cause to curse, If thou hast slaine Lysander in his sleepe, Being oreshooes in bloud, plunge in the deepe, and kill me too: The Sunne was not so true vnto the day, As he to me. Would he haue stollen away, From sleeping Hermia? Ile beleeue as soone This whole earth may be bord, and that the Moone May through the Center creepe, and so displease Her brothers noonetide, with th'Antipodes. It cannot be but thou hast murdred him, So should a murtherer looke, so dead, so grim So should the murderer looke, and so should I, Pierst through the heart with your stearne cruelty: Yet you the murderer lookes as bright as cleare, As yonder Venus in her glimmering spheare What's this to my Lysander? where is he? Ah good Demetrius, wilt thou giue him me? I'de rather giue his carkasse to my hounds Out dog, out cur, thou driu'st me past the bounds Of maidens patience. Hast thou slaine him then? Henceforth be neuer numbred among men. Oh, once tell true, euen for my sake, Durst thou a lookt vpon him, being awake? And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O braue tutch: Could not a worme, an Adder do so much? An Adder did it: for with doubler tongue Then thine (thou serpent) neuer Adder stung You spend your passion on a mispris'd mood, I am not guiltie of Lysanders blood: Nor is he dead for ought that I can tell I pray thee tell me then that he is well And if I could, what should I get therefore? A priuiledge, neuer to see me more; And from thy hated presence part I: see me no more Whether he be dead or no. There is no following her in this fierce vaine, Here therefore for a while I will remaine. So sorrowes heauinesse doth heauier grow: For debt that bankrout slip doth sorrow owe, Which now in some slight measure it will pay, If for his tender here I make some stay. Lie downe. What hast thou done? Thou hast mistaken quite And laid the loue iuyce on some true loues sight: Of thy misprision, must perforce ensue Some true loue turn'd, and not a false turn'd true Then fate ore-rules, that one man holding troth, A million faile, confounding oath on oath About the wood, goe swifter then the winde, And Helena of Athens looke thou finde. All fancy sicke she is, and pale of cheere, With sighes of loue, that costs the fresh bloud deare. By some illusion see thou bring her heere, Ile charme his eyes against she doth appeare I go, I go, looke how I goe, Swifter then arrow from the Tartars bowe. Flower of this purple die, Hit with Cupids archery, Sinke in apple of his eye, When his loue he doth espie, Let her shine as gloriously As the Venus of the sky. When thou wak'st if she be by, Beg of her for remedy. dogberry. Captaine of our Fairy band, Helena is heere at hand, And the youth, mistooke by me, Pleading for a Louers fee. Shall we their fond Pageant see? Lord, what fooles these mortals be! Stand aside: the noyse they make, Will cause Demetrius to awake dogberry. Then will two at once wooe one, That must needs be sport alone: And those things doe best please me, That befall preposterously. Why should you think y I should wooe in scorn? Scorne and derision neuer comes in teares: Looke when I vow I weepe; and vowes so borne, In their natiuity all truth appeares. How can these things in me, seeme scorne to you? Bearing the badge of faith to proue them true You doe aduance your cunning more & more, When truth kils truth, O diuelish holy fray! These vowes are Hermias. Will you giue her ore? Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh. Your vowes to her, and me, (put in two scales) Will euen weigh, and both as light as tales I had no iudgement, when to her I swore Nor none in my minde, now you giue her ore Demetrius loues her, and he loues not you. O Helen, goddesse, nimph, perfect, diuine, To what, my loue, shall I compare thine eyne! Christall is muddy, O how ripe in show, Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow! That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow, Fan'd with the Easterne winde, turnes to a crow, When thou holdst vp thy hand. O let me kisse This Princesse of pure white, this seale of blisse O spight! O hell! I see you are all bent To set against me, for your merriment: If you were ciuill, and knew curtesie, You would not doe me thus much iniury. Can you not hate me, as I know you doe, But you must ioyne in soules to mocke me to? If you are men, as men you are in show, You would not vse a gentle Lady so; To vow, and sweare, and superpraise my parts, When I am sure you hate me with your hearts. You both are Riuals, and loue Hermia; And now both Riuals to mocke Helena. A trim exploit, a manly enterprize, To coniure teares vp in a poore maids eyes, With your derision; none of noble sort, Would so offend a Virgin, and extort A poore soules patience, all to make you sport, You are vnkind Demetrius; be not so, For you loue Hermia; this you know I know; And here with all good will, with all my heart, In Hermias loue I yeeld you vp my part; And yours of Helena, To me bequeath, Whom I do loue, and will do to my death Neuer did mockers wast more idle breth Lysander, keep thy Hermia, I will none: If ere I lou'd her, all that loue is gone. My heart to her, but as guest-wise soiourn'd, And now to Helen it is home return'd, There to remaine It is not so Disparage not the faith thou dost not know, Lest to thy perill thou abide it deare. Looke where thy Loue comes, yonder is thy deare. Dark night, that from the eye his function takes, The eare more quicke of apprehension makes, Wherein it doth impaire the seeing sense, It paies the hearing double recompence. Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander found, Mine eare (I thanke it) brought me to that sound. But why vnkindly didst thou leaue me so? Why should hee stay whom Loue doth presse to go? What loue could presse Lysander from my side? Lysanders loue (that would not let him bide) Faire Helena; who more engilds the night, Then all yon fierie oes, and eies of light. Why seek'st thou me? Could not this make thee know, The hate I bare thee, made me leaue thee so? You speake not as you thinke; it cannot be Loe, she is one of this confederacy, Now I perceiue they haue conioyn'd all three, To fashion this false sport in spight of me. Iniurous Hermia, most vngratefull maid, Haue you conspir'd, haue you with these contriu'd To baite me, with this foule derision? Is all the counsell that we two haue shar'd, The sisters vowes, the houres that we haue spent, When wee haue chid the hasty footed time, For parting vs; O, is all forgot? All schooledaies friendship, child-hood innocence? We Hermia, like two Artificiall gods, Haue with our needles, created both one flower, Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion, Both warbling of one song, both in one key: As if our hands, our sides, voices, and mindes Had beene incorporate. So we grew together, Like to a double cherry, seeming parted, But yet a vnion in partition, Two louely berries molded on one stem, So with two seeming bodies, but one heart, Two of the first life coats in Heraldry, Due but to one and crowned with one crest. And will you rent our ancient loue asunder, To ioyne with men in scorning your poore friend? It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly. Our sexe as well as I, may chide you for it, Though I alone doe feele the iniurie I am amazed at your passionate words, I scorne you not; It seemes that you scorne me Haue you not set Lysander, as in scorne To follow me, and praise my eies and face? And made your other loue, Demetrius (Who euen but now did spurne me with his foote) To call me goddesse, nimph, diuine, and rare, Precious, celestiall? Wherefore speakes he this To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander Denie your loue (so rich within his soule) And tender me (forsooth) affection, But by your setting on, by your consent? What though I be not so in grace as you, So hung vpon with loue, so fortunate? (But miserable most, to loue vnlou'd) This you should pittie, rather then despise I vnderstand not what you meane by this I, doe, perseuer, counterfeit sad lookes, Make mouthes vpon me when I turne my backe, Winke each at other, hold the sweete iest vp: This sport well carried, shall be chronicled. If you haue any pittie, grace, or manners, You would not make me such an argument: But fare ye well, 'tis partly mine owne fault, Which death or absence soone shall remedie Stay gentle Helena, heare my excuse, My loue, my life, my soule, faire Helena O excellent! Sweete, do not scorne her so If she cannot entreate, I can compell Thou canst compell, no more then she entreate. Thy threats haue no more strength then her weak praise. Helen, I loue thee, by my life I doe; I sweare by that which I will lose for thee, To proue him false, that saies I loue thee not I say, I loue thee more then he can do If thou say so, withdraw and proue it too Quick, come Lysander, whereto tends all this? Away, you Ethiope No, no, Sir, seeme to breake loose; Take on as you would follow, But yet come not: you are a tame man, go Hang off thou cat, thou bur; vile thing let loose, Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent Why are you growne so rude? What change is this sweete Loue? Thy loue? out tawny Tartar, out; Out loathed medicine; O hated poison hence Do you not iest? Yes sooth, and so do you Demetrius: I will keepe my word with thee I would I had your bond: for I perceiue A weake bond holds you; Ile not trust your word What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead? Although I hate her, Ile not harme her so What, can you do me greater harme then hate? Hate me, wherefore? O me, what newes my Loue? Am not I Hermia? Are not you Lysander? I am as faire now, as I was ere while. Since night you lou'd me: yet since night you left me. Why then you left me (O the gods forbid) In earnest, shall I say? I, by my life; And neuer did desire to see thee more. Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt; Be certaine, nothing truer: 'tis no iest, That I do hate thee, and loue Helena O me, you iugler, you canker blossome, You theefe of loue; What, haue you come by night, And stolne my loues heart from him? Fine yfaith: Haue you no modesty, no maiden shame, No touch of bashfulnesse? What, will you teare Impatient answers from my gentle tongue? Fie, fie, you counterfeit, you puppet, you Puppet? why so? I, that way goes the game. Now I perceiue that she hath made compare Betweene our statures, she hath vrg'd her height, And with her personage, her tall personage, Her height (forsooth) she hath preuail'd with him. And are you growne so high in his esteeme, Because I am so dwarfish, and so low? How low am I, thou painted May-pole? Speake, How low am I? I am not yet so low, But that my nailes can reach vnto thine eyes I pray you though you mocke me, gentlemen, Let her not hurt me; I was neuer curst: I haue no gift at all in shrewishnesse; I am a right maide for my cowardize; Let her not strike me: you perhaps may thinke, Because she is something lower then my selfe, That I can match her Lower? harke againe Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me, I euermore did loue you Hermia, Did euer keepe your counsels, neuer wronged you, Saue that in loue vnto Demetrius, I told him of your stealth vnto this wood. He followed you, for loue I followed him, But he hath chid me hence, and threatned me To strike me, spurne me, nay to kill me too; And now, so you will let me quiet go, To Athens will I beare my folly backe, And follow you no further. Let me go. You see how simple, and how fond I am Why get you gone: who ist that hinders you? A foolish heart, that I leaue here behinde What, with Lysander? With Demetrius Be not afraid, she shall not harme thee Helena No sir, she shall not, though you take her part O when she's angry, she is keene and shrewd, She was a vixen when she went to schoole, And though she be but little, she is fierce Little againe? Nothing but low and little? Why will you suffer her to flout me thus? Let me come to her Get you gone you dwarfe, You minimus, of hindring knot-grasse made, You bead, you acorne You are too officious, In her behalfe that scornes your seruices. Let her alone, speake not of Helena, Take not her part. For if thou dost intend Neuer so little shew of loue to her, Thou shalt abide it Now she holds me not, Now follow if thou dar'st, to try whose right, Of thine or mine is most in Helena Follow? Nay, Ile goe with thee cheeke by iowle. You Mistris, all this coyle is long of you. Nay, goe not backe I will not trust you I, Nor longer stay in your curst companie. Your hands then mine, are quicker for a fray, My legs are longer though to runne away. This is thy negligence, still thou mistak'st, Or else committ'st thy knaueries willingly dogberry. Beleeue me, King of shadowes, I mistooke, Did not you tell me, I should know the man, By the Athenian garments he hath on? And so farre blamelesse proues my enterprize, That I haue nointed an Athenians eies, And so farre am I glad, it so did sort, As this their iangling I esteeme a sport Thou seest these Louers seeke a place to fight, Hie therefore Robin, ouercast the night, The starrie Welkin couer thou anon, With drooping fogge as blacke as Acheron, And lead these testie Riuals so astray, As one come not within anothers way. Like to Lysander, sometime frame thy tongue, Then stirre Demetrius vp with bitter wrong; And sometime raile thou like Demetrius; And from each other looke thou leade them thus, Till ore their browes, death-counterfeiting, sleepe With leaden legs, and Battie-wings doth creepe: Then crush this hearbe into Lysanders eie, Whose liquor hath this vertuous propertie, To take from thence all error, with his might, and make his eie-bals role with wonted sight. When they next wake, all this derision Shall seeme a dreame, and fruitless vision, And backe to Athens shall the Louers wend With league, whose date till death shall neuer end. Whiles I in this affaire do thee imploy, Ile to my Queene, and beg her Indian Boy; And then I will her charmed eie release From monsters view, and all things shall be peace dogberry. My Fairie Lord, this must be done with haste, For night-swift Dragons cut the Clouds full fast, And yonder shines Auroras harbinger; At whose approach Ghosts wandring here and there, Troope home to Church-yards; damned spirits all, That in crosse-waies and flouds haue buriall, Alreadie to their wormie beds are gone; For feare least day should looke their shames vpon, They wilfully themselues exile from light, And must for aye consort with blacke browd night But we are spirits of another sort: I, with the mornings loue haue oft made sport, And like a Forrester, the groues may tread, Euen till the Easterne gate all fierie red, Opening on Neptune, With faire blessed beames, Turnes into yellow gold, his salt greene streames. But not withstanding haste, make no delay: We may effect this businesse, yet ere day dogberry. Vp and downe, vp and downe, I will leade them vp and downe: I am fear'd in field and towne. Goblin, lead them vp and downe: here comes one. Where art thou, proud Demetrius? Speake thou now Here villaine, drawne & readie. Where art thou? I will be with thee straight Follow me then to plainer ground. Lysander, speake againe; Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled? Speake in some bush: Where dost thou hide thy head? Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars, Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars, And wilt not come? Come recreant, come thou childe, Ile whip thee with a rod. He is defil'd That drawes a sword on thee Yea, art thou there? Follow my voice, we'l try no manhood here. He goes before me, and still dares me on, When I come where he cals, then he's gone. The Villaine is much lighter heel'd then I: I followed fast, but faster he did flye; shifting places. That fallen am I in darke vneuen way, And here wil rest me. Come thou gentle day: lye down. For if but once thou shew me thy gray light, Ile finde Demetrius, and reuenge this spight. Ho, ho, ho; coward, why com'st thou not? Abide me, if thou dar'st. For well I wot, Thou runst before me, shifting euery place, And dar'st not stand, nor looke me in the face. Where art thou? Come hither, I am here Nay then thou mock'st me; thou shalt buy this deere, If euer I thy face by day-light see. Now goe thy way: faintnesse constraineth me, To measure out my length on this cold bed, By daies approach looke to be visited. O weary night, O long and tedious night, Abate thy houres, shine comforts from the East, That I may backe to Athens by day-light, From these that my poore companie detest; And sleepe that sometime shuts vp sorrowes eie, Steale me a while from mine owne companie. Yet but three? Come one more, Two of both kindes makes vp foure. Here she comes, curst and sad, Cupid is a knauish lad, Thus to make poore females mad Neuer so wearie, neuer so in woe, Bedabbled with the dew, and torne with briars, I can no further crawle, no further goe; My legs can keepe no pace with my desires. Here will I rest me till the breake of day, Heauens shield Lysander, if they meane a fray On the ground sleepe sound, Ile apply your eie gentle louer, remedy. When thou wak'st, thou tak'st True delight in the sight of thy former Ladies eye, And the Country Prouerb knowne, That euery man should take his owne, In your waking shall be showne. Iacke shall haue Iill, nought shall goe ill. The man shall haue his Mare againe, and all shall bee well. They sleepe all the Act. behinde them. Come, sit thee downe vpon this flowry bed, While I thy amiable cheekes doe coy, And sticke muske roses in thy sleeke smoothe head, And kisse thy faire large eares, my gentle ioy Where's Peaseblossome? Ready Scratch my head, Pease-blossome. Wher's Mounsieuer Cobweb Ready Mounsieur Cobweb, good Mounsier get your weapons in your hand, & kill me a red hipt humble-Bee, on the top of a thistle; and good Mounsieur bring mee the hony bag. Doe not fret your selfe too much in the action, Mounsieur; and good mounsieur haue a care the hony bag breake not, I would be loth to haue you ouerflowne with a hony-bag signiour. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed? Ready Giue me your neafe, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you leaue your courtesie good Mounsieur What's your will? Nothing good Mounsieur, but to help Caualery Cobweb to scratch. I must to the Barbers Mounsieur, for me-thinkes I am maruellous hairy about the face. And I am such a tender asse, if my haire do but tickle me, I must scratch What, wilt thou heare some musicke, my sweet loue I haue a reasonable good eare in musicke. Let vs haue the tongs and the bones. Musicke Tongs, Rurall Musicke. Or say sweete Loue, what thou desirest to eat Truly a pecke of Prouender; I could munch your good dry Oates. Me-thinkes I haue a great desire to a bottle of hay: good hay, sweete hay hath no fellow I haue a venturous Fairy, That shall seeke the Squirrels hoard, And fetch thee new Nuts I had rather haue a handfull or two of dried pease. But I pray you let none of your people stirre me, I haue an exposition of sleepe come vpon me Sleepe thou, and I will winde thee in my arms, Fairies be gone, and be alwaies away. So doth the woodbine, the sweet Honisuckle, Gently entwist; the female Iuy so Enrings the barky fingers of the Elme. O how I loue thee! how I dote on thee! Welcome good Robin: Seest thou this sweet sight? Her dotage now I doe begin to pitty. For meeting her of late behinde the wood, Seeking sweet sauours for this hatefull foole, I did vpbraid her, and fall out with her. For she his hairy temples then had rounded, With coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers. And that same dew which somtime on the buds, Was wont to swell like round and orient pearles; Stood now within the pretty flouriets eyes, Like teares that did their owne disgrace bewaile. When I had at my pleasure taunted her, And she in milde termes beg'd my patience, I then did aske of her, her changeling childe, Which straight she gaue me, and her fairy sent To beare him to my Bower in Fairy Land. And now I haue the Boy, I will vndoe This hatefull imperfection of her eyes. And gentle dogberrye, take this transformed scalpe, From off the head of this Athenian swaine; That he awaking when the other doe, May all to Athens backe againe repaire, And thinke no more of this nights accidents, But as the fierce vexation of dreame. But first I will release the Fairy Queene. Be thou as thou wast wont to be; See as thou wast wont to see. Dians bud, or Cupids flower, Hath such force and blessed power. Now my Titania wake you my sweet Queene My Oberon, what visions haue I seene! Me-thought I was enamoured of an asse There lies your loue How came these things to passe? Oh, how mine eyes doth loath this visage now! Silence a while. Robin take off his head: Titania, musick call, and strike more dead Then common sleepe; of all these, fine the sense Musicke, ho musicke, such as charmeth sleepe. Musick still. When thou wak'st, with thine owne fooles eies peepe Sound musick; come my Queen, take hands with me And rocke the ground whereon these sleepers be. Now thou and I new in amity, And will to morrow midnight, solemnly Dance in Duke Theseus house triumphantly, And blesse it to all faire posterity. There shall the paires of faithfull Louers be Wedded, with Theseus, all in iollity Faire King attend, and marke, I doe heare the morning Larke, Then my Queene in silence sad, Trip we after the nights shade; We the Globe can compasse soone, Swifter then the wandering Moone Come my Lord, and in our flight, Tell me how it came this night, That I sleeping heere was found, Sleepers Lye still. With these mortals on the ground. Winde Hornes. Goe one of you, finde out the Forrester, For now our obseruation is perform'd; And since we haue the vaward of the day, My Loue shall heare the musicke of my hounds. Vncouple in the Westerne valley, let them goe; Dispatch I say, and finde the Forrester. We will faire Queene, vp to the Mountains top, And marke the musicall confusion Of hounds and eccho in coniunction I was with Hercules and Cadmus once. When in a wood of Creete they bayed the Beare With hounds of Sparta; neuer did I heare Such gallant chiding. For besides the groues, The skies, the fountaines, euery region neere, Seeme all one mutuall cry. I neuer heard So musicall a discord, such sweet thunder My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kinde, So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung With eares that sweepe away the morning dew, Crooke kneed, and dew-lapt, like Thessalian Buls, Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bels, Each vnder each. A cry more tuneable Was neuer hallowed to, nor cheer'd with horne, In Creete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly; Iudge when you heare. But soft, what nimphs are these? My Lord, this is my daughter heere asleepe, And this Lysander, this Demetrius is, This Helena, olde Nedars Helena, I wonder of this being heere together No doubt they rose vp early, to obserue The right of May; and hearing our intent, Came heere in grace of our solemnity. But speake Egeus, is not this the day That Hermia should giue answer of her choice? It is, my Lord Goe bid the hunts-men wake them with their hornes. Hornes and they wake. Shout within, they all start vp. Good morrow friends: Saint Valentine is past, Begin these wood birds but to couple now? Pardon my Lord I pray you all stand vp. I know you two are Riuall enemies. How comes this gentle concord in the world, That hatred is so farre from iealousie, To sleepe by hate, and feare no enmity My Lord, I shall reply amazedly, Halfe sleepe, halfe waking. but as yet, I sweare, I cannot truly say how I came heere. But as I thinke (for truly would I speake) And now I doe bethinke me, so it is; I came with Hermia hither. Our intent Was to be gone from Athens, where we might be Without the perill of the Athenian Law Enough, enough, my Lord: you haue enough; I beg the Law, the Law, vpon his head: They would have stolne away, they would Demetrius, Thereby to haue defeated you and me: You of your wife, and me of my consent; Of my consent, that she should be your wife My Lord, faire Helen told me of their stealth, Of this their purpose hither, to this wood, And I in furie hither followed them; Faire Helena, in fancy followed me. But my good Lord, I wot not by what not by what power, (But by some power it is) my loue To Hermia (melted as the snow) Seems to me now as the remembrance of an idle gaude, Which in my childehood I did doat vpon: And all the faith, the vertue of my heart, The obiect and the pleasure of mine eye, Is onely Helena. To her, my Lord, Was I betroth'd, ere I see Hermia, But like a sickenesse did I loath this food, But as in health, come to my naturall taste, Now doe I wish it, loue it, long for it, And will for euermore be true to it Faire Louers, you are fortunately met; Of this discourse we shall heare more anon. Egeus, I will ouer-beare your will; For in the Temple, by and by with vs, These couples shall eternally be knit. And for the morning now is something worne, Our purpos'd hunting shall be set aside. Away, with vs to Athens; three and three, Wee'll hold a feast in great solemnitie. Come Hippolita. These things seeme small & vndistinguishable, Like farre off mountaines turned into Clouds Me-thinks I see these things with parted eye, When euery thing seemes double So me-thinkes: And I haue found Demetrius, like a iewell, Mine owne, and not mine owne It seemes to mee, That yet we sleepe, we dreame. Do not you thinke, The Duke was heere, and bid vs follow him? Yea, and my Father And Hippolita And he bid vs follow to the Temple Why then we are awake; lets follow him, and by the way let vs recount our dreames. Bottome wakes. When my cue comes, call me, and I will answer. My next is, most faire Piramus. Hey ho. Peter Quince? Flute the bellowes-mender? Snout the tinker? Starueling? Gods my life! Stolne hence, and left me asleepe: I haue had a most rare vision. I had a dreame, past the wit of man, to say, what dreame it was. Man is but an Asse, if he goe about to expound this dreame. Me-thought I was, there is no man can tell what. Me-thought I was, and me-thought I had. But man is but a patch'd foole, if he will offer to say, what me-thought I had. The eye of man hath not heard, the eare of man hath not seen, mans hand is not able to taste, his tongue to conceiue, nor his heart to report, what my dreame was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballet of this dreame, it shall be called Bottomes Dreame, because it hath no bottome; and I will sing it in the latter end of a play, before the Duke. Peraduenture, to make it the more gracious, I shall sing it at her death. Haue you sent to Bottomes house? Is he come home yet? He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt hee is transported If he come not, then the play is mar'd. It goes not forward, doth it? It is not possible: you haue not a man in all Athens, able to discharge Piramus but he No, hee hath simply the best wit of any handycraft man in Athens Yea, and the best person too, and hee is a very Paramour, for a sweet voyce You must say, Paragon. A Paramour is (God blesse vs) a thing of nought. Masters, the Duke is comming from the Temple, and there is two or three Lords & Ladies more married. If our sport had gone forward, we had all bin made men O sweet bully Bottome: thus hath he lost sixepence a day, during his life; he could not haue scaped sixpence a day. And the Duke had not giuen him sixpence a day for playing Piramus, Ile be hang'd. He would haue deserued it. Sixpence a day in Piramus, or nothing. Where are these Lads? Where are these hearts? Bottome, o most couragious day! O most happie houre! Masters, I am to discourse wonders; but ask me not what. For if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I will tell you euery thing as it fell out Let vs heare, sweet Bottome Not a word of me: all that I will tell you, is, that the Duke hath dined. Get your apparell together, good strings to your beards, new ribbands to your pumps, meete presently at the Palace, euery man looke ore his part: for the short and the long is, our play is preferred: In any case let Thisby haue cleane linnen: and let not him that playes the Lion, paire his nailes, for they shall hang out for the Lions clawes. And most deare Actors, eate no Onions, nor Garlicke; for wee are to vtter sweete breath, and I doe not doubt but to heare them say, it is a sweet Comedy. No more words: away, go away. 'Tis strange my Theseus, y these louers speake of More strange then true. I neuer may beleeue These anticke fables, nor these Fairy toyes, Louers and mad men haue such seething braines, Such shaping phantasies, that apprehend more Then coole reason euer comprehends. The Lunaticke, the Louer, and the Poet, Are of imagination all compact. One sees more diuels then vaste hell can hold; That is the mad man. The Louer, all as franticke, Sees Helens beauty in a brow of Egipt. The Poets eye in a fine frenzy rolling, doth glance From heauen to earth, from earth to heauen. And as imagination bodies forth the forms of things Vnknowne; the Poets pen turnes them to shapes, And giues to aire nothing, a locall habitation, And a name. Such tricks hath strong imagination, That if it would but apprehend some ioy, It comprehends some bringer of that ioy. Or in the night, imagining some feare, Howe easie is a bush suppos'd a Beare? But all the storie of the night told ouer, And all their minds transfigur'd so together, More witnesseth than fancies images, And growes to something of great constancie; But howsoeuer, strange, and admirable. Heere come the louers, full of ioy and mirth: Ioy, gentle friends, ioy and fresh dayes Of loue accompany your hearts More then to vs, waite in your royall walkes, your boord, your bed Come now, what maskes, what dances shall we haue, To weare away this long age of three houres, Between our after supper, and bed-time? Where is our vsuall manager of mirth? What Reuels are in hand? Is there no play, To ease the anguish of a torturing houre? Call Egeus Heere mighty Theseus Say, what abridgement haue you for this euening? What maske? What musicke? How shall we beguile The lazie time, if not with some delight? There is a breefe how many sports are rife: Make choise of which your Highnesse will see first The battell with the Centaurs to be sung By an Athenian Eunuch, to the Harpe Wee'l none of that. That haue I told my Loue In glory of my kinsman Hercules The riot of the tipsie Bachanals, Tearing the Thracian singer, in their rage? That is an old deuice, and it was plaid When I from Thebes came last a Conqueror The thrice three Muses, mourning for the death of learning, late deceast in beggerie That is some Satire keene and criticall, Not sorting with a nuptiall ceremonie A tedious breefe Scene of yong Piramus, And his loue Thisby; very tragicall mirth Merry and tragicall? Tedious, and briefe? That is, hot ice, and wondrous strange snow. How shall wee finde the concord of this discord? A play there is, my Lord, some ten words long, Which is as breefe, as I haue knowne a play; But by ten words, my Lord, it is too long; Which makes it tedious. For in all the play, There is not one word apt, one Player fitted. And tragicall my noble Lord it is: for Piramus Therein doth kill himselfe. Which when I saw Rehearst, I must confesse, made mine eyes water: But more merrie teares, the passion of loud laughter Neuer shed What are they that do play it? Hard handed men, that worke in Athens heere, Which neuer labour'd in their mindes till now; And now haue toyled their vnbreathed memories With this same play, against your nuptiall And we will heare it No my noble Lord, it is not for you. I haue heard It ouer, and it is nothing, nothing in the world; Vnless you can finde sport in their intents, Extreamely stretched, and cond with cruell paine, To doe you seruice I will heare that play. For neuer any thing Can be amisse, when simplenesse and duty tender it. Goe bring them in, and take your places, Ladies I loue not to see wretchednesse orecharged; And duty in his seruice perishing Why gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing He saies, they can doe nothing in this kinde The kinder we, to giue them thanks for nothing Our sport shall be, to take what they mistake; And what poore duty cannot doe, noble respect Takes it in might, not merit. Where I haue come, great Clearkes haue purposed To greete me with premeditated welcomes; Where I haue seene them shiuer and looke pale, Make periods in the midst of sentences, Throttle their practiz'd accent in their feares, And in conclusion, dumbly haue broke off, Not paying me a welcome. Trust me sweete, Out of this silence yet, I pickt a welcome: And in the modesty of fearefull duty, I read as much, as from the ratling tongue Of saucy and audacious eloquence. Loue therefore, and tongue-tide simplicity, In least, speake most, to my capacity So please your Grace, the Prologue is addrest Let him approach. Trum. If we offend, it is with our good will. That you should thinke, we come not to offend, But with good will. To shew our simple skill, That is the true beginning of our end. Consider then, we come but in despight. We do not come, as minding to content you, Our true intent is. All for your delight, We are not heere. That you should here repent you, The Actors are at hand; and by their show, You shall know all, that you are like to know This fellow doth not stand vpon points He hath rid his Prologue, like a rough Colt: he knowes not the stop. A good morall my lord. it is not enough to speake, but to speake true Indeed hee hath plaid on his Prologue, like a childe on a Recorder, a sound, but not in gouernment His speech was like a tangled chaine: nothing impaired, but all disordered. Who is next? Tawyer with a Trumpet before them. Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show, But wonder on, till truth make all things plaine. This man is Piramus, if you would know; This beauteous Lady, Thisby is certaine. This man, with lyme and rough-cast, doth present Wall, that vile wall, which did these louers sunder: And through walls chink (poor soules) they are content To whisper. At the which, let no man wonder. This man, with Lanthorne, dog, and bush of thorne, Presenteth moone-shine. For if you will know, By moone-shine did these Louers thinke no scorne To meet at Ninus toombe, there, there to wooe: This grizly beast (which Lyon hight by name) The trusty Thisby, comming first by night, Did scarre away, or rather did affright: And as she fled, her mantle she did fall; Which Lyon vile with bloody mouth did staine. Anon comes Piramus, sweet youth and tall, And findes his Thisbies Mantle slaine; Whereat, with blade, with bloody blamefull blade, He brauely broacht his boiling bloudy breast, And Thisby, tarrying in Mulberry shade, His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest, Let Lyon, Moone-shine, Wall, and Louers twaine, At large discourse, while here they doe remaine. I wonder if the Lion be to speake No wonder, my Lord: one Lion may, when many Asses doe. In this same Interlude, it doth befall, That I, one Snowt (by name) present a wall: And such a wall, as I would haue you thinke, That had in it a crannied hole or chinke: Through which the Louers, Piramus and Thisbie Did whisper often, very secretly. This loame, this rough-cast, and this stone doth shew, That I am that same Wall; the truth is so. And this the cranny is, right and sinister, Through which the fearfull Louers are to whisper Would you desire Lime and Haire to speake better? It is the wittiest partition, that euer I heard discourse, my Lord Pyramus drawes neere the Wall, silence. O grim lookt night, o night with hue so blacke, O night, which euer art, when day is not: O night, o night, alacke, alacke, alacke, I feare my Thisbies promise is forgot. And thou o wall, thou sweet and louely wall, That stands between her fathers ground and mine, Thou wall, o Wall, o sweet and louely wall, Shew me thy chinke, to blinke through with mine eine. Thankes courteous wall. Ioue shield thee well for this. But what see I? No Thisbie doe I see. O wicked wall, through whom I see no blisse, Curst be thy stones for thus deceiuing mee The wall me-thinkes being sensible, should curse againe No in truth sir, he should not. Deceiuing me, Is Thisbies cue; she is to enter, and I am to spy Her through the wall. You shall see it will fall. Pat as I told you; yonder she comes O wall, full often hast thou heard my mones, For parting my faire Piramus, and me My cherry lips haue often kist thy stones; Thy stones with Lime and Haire knit vp in thee I see a voyce; now will I to the chinke, To spy and I can heare my Thisbies face. Thisbie? My Loue thou art, my Loue I thinke Thinke what thou wilt, I am thy Louers grace, And like Limander am I trusty still And like Helen till the Fates me kill Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you O kisse me through the hole of this vile wall I kisse the wals hole, not your lips at all Wilt thou at Ninnies tombe meete me straight way? Tide life, tide death, I come without delay Thus haue I Wall, my part discharged so; And being done, thus Wall away doth go. Now is the morall downe between the two Neighbours No remedie my Lord, when Wals are so wilfull, to heare without warning This is the silliest stuffe that ere I heard The best in this kind are but shadowes, and the worst are no worse, if imagination amend them It must be your imagination then, & not theirs If wee imagine no worse of them then they of themselues, they may passe for excellent men. Here com two noble beasts, in a man and a Lion. You Ladies, you (whose gentle harts do feare The smallest monstrous mouse that creepes on floore) May now perchance, both quake and tremble heere, When Lion rough in wildest rage doth roare. Then know that I, one Snug the Ioyner am A Lion fell, nor else no Lions dam: For if I should as Lion come in strife Into this place, 'twere pittie of my life A verie gentle beast, and of good conscience The verie best at a beast, my Lord, y ere I saw This Lion is a verie Fox for his valor True, and a Goose for his discretion Not so my Lord: for his valor cannot carrie his discretion, and the fox carries the Goose His discretion I am sure cannot carrie his valor: for the Goose carries not the Fox. It is well; leaue it to his discretion, and let vs hearken to the Moone This Lanthorne doth the horned Moone present He should haue worne the hornes on his head Hee is no crescent, and his hornes are inuisible, This lanthorne doth the horned Moone present: My selfe, the man i'th Moone doth seeme to be This is the greatest error of all the rest; the man Should be put into the Lanthorne. How is it els the man i'th Moone? He dares not come there for the candle. For you see, it is already in snuffe I am wearie of this Moone; would he would change It appeares by his smal light of discretion, that he is in the wane: but yet in courtesie, in all reason, we must stay the time Proceed Moone All that I haue to say, is to tell you, that the Lanthorne is the Moone; I, the man in the Moone; this thorne bush; my thorne bush; and this dog, my dog Why all these should be in the Lanthorne: for they are in the Moone. But silence, heere comes Thisby. This is old Ninnies tombe: where is my loue? Oh. The Lion roares, Thisby runs off. Well roar'd Lion Well run Thisby Well shone Moone. Truly the Moone shines with a good grace Wel mouz'd Lion And then came Piramus And so the Lion vanisht. Sweet Moone, I thank thee for thy sunny beames, I thanke thee Moone, for shining now so bright: For by thy gracious, golden, glittering beames, I trust to taste of truest Thisbies sight. But stay: O spight! but marke, poore Knight, What dreadful dole is heere? Eyes do you see! How can it be! O dainty Ducke: O Deere! Thy mantle good; what staind with blood! Approch you furies fell: O Fates! come, come: Cut thred and thrum, Quaile, crush, conclude, and quell This passion, and the death of a deare friend, Would go neere to make a man looke sad Beshrew my heart, but I pittie the man O wherefore Nature, did'st thou Lions frame? Since lion vilde hath heere deflour'd my deere: Which is: no, no, which was the fairest Dame That liu'd, that lou'd, that like'd, that look'd with cheere. Come teares, confound: Out sword, and wound The pap of Piramus: I, that left pap, where heart doth hop; Thus dye I, thus, thus, thus. Now am I dead, now am I fled, my soule is in the sky, Tongue lose thy light, Moone take thy flight, Now dye, dye, dye, dye, dye No Die, but an ace for him; for he is but one Lesse then an ace man. For he is dead, he is nothing With the helpe of a Surgeon, he might yet recouer, and proue an Asse How chance Moone-shine is gone before? Thisby comes backe, and findes her Louer. She wil finde him by starre-light. Heere she comes, and her passion ends the play Me thinkes shee should not vse a long one for such a Piramus: I hope she will be breefe A Moth wil turne the ballance, which Piramus which Thisby is the better She hath spyed him already, with those sweete eyes And thus she meanes, videlicit Asleepe my Loue? What, dead my Doue? O Piramus arise: Speake, speake. Quite dumbe? Dead, dead? A tombe Must couer thy sweet eyes. These Lilly Lips, this cherry nose, These yellow Cowslip cheekes Are gone, are gone: Louers make mone: His eyes were greene as Leekes. O Sisters three, come, come to mee, With hands as pale as Milke, Lay them in gore, since you haue shore with sheeres, his thred of silke. Tongue not a word: Come trusty sword: Come blade, my brest imbrue: And farwell friends, thus Thisbie ends; Adieu, adieu, adieu Moone-shine & Lion are left to burie the dead I, and Wall too No, I assure you, the wall is downe, that parted their Fathers. Will it please you to see the Epilogue, or to heare a Bergomask dance, betweene two of our company? No Epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no excuse. Neuer excuse; for when the plaiers are all dead, there need none to be blamed. Marry, if hee that writ it had plaid Piramus, and hung himselfe in Thisbies garter, it would haue beene a fine Tragedy: and so it is truely, and very notably discharg'd. but come, your Burgomaske; let your Epilogue alone. The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelue. Louers to bed, 'tis almost Fairy time. I feare we shall out-sleepe the comming morne, As much as we this night haue ouer-watcht. This palpable grosse play hath well beguil'd The heauy gate of night. Sweet friends to bed. A fortnight hold we this solemnity. In nightly Reuels; and new iollitie. dogberry. Now the hungry Lyons rores, And the Wolfe beholds the Moone: Whilest the heauy ploughman snores, All with weary taske fore-done. Now the wasted brands doe glow, Whil'st the scritch-owle, scritching loud, Puts the wretch that lies in woe, In remembrance of a shrowd. Now it is the time of night, That the graues, all gaping wide, Euery one lets forth his spright, In the Church-way paths to glide, And we Fairies, that do runne, By the triple Hecates teame, From the presence of the Sunne, Following darkenesse like a dreame, Now are frollicke; not a Mouse Shall disturbe this hallowed house. I am sent with broome before, To sweep the dust behinde the doore. Through the house giue glimmering light, By the dead and drowsie fier, Euerie Elfe and Fairie spright, Hop as light as bird from brier, And this Ditty after me, sing and dance it trippinglie, First rehearse this song by roate, To each word a warbling note. Hand in hand, with Fairie grace, Will we sing and blesse this place. The Song. Now vntill the breake of day, Through this house each Fairy stray. To the best Bride-bed will we, Which by vs shall blessed be: And the issue there create, Euer shall be fortunate: So shall all the couples three, Euer true in louing be: And the blots of Natures hand, Shall not in their issue stand. Neuer mole, harelip, nor scarre, nor mark prodigious, such as are Despised in Natiuitie, Shall vpon their children be. With this field dew consecrate, Euery Fairy take his gate, And each seuerall chamber blesse, Through this Pallace with sweet peace, Euer shall in safety rest. And the owner of it blest. Trip away, make no stay; Meet me all by breake of day If we shadowes haue offended, Thinke but this (and all is mended) That you haue but slumbred heere, While these Visions did appeare. And this weake and idle theame, No more yeelding but a dreame, Gentles, doe not reprehend. If you pardon, we will mend. And as I am an honest dogberrye, If we haue vnearned lucke, Now to scape the Serpents tongue, We will make amends ere long: Else the dogberrye a lyar call. So good night vnto you all. Giue me your hands, if we be friends, And Robin shall restore amends. Cant. My Lord, Ile tell you, that selfe Bill is vrg'd, Which in th' eleueth yere of y last Kings reign Was like, and had indeed against vs past, But that the scambling and vnquiet time Did push it out of farther question Ely. But how my Lord shall we resist it now? Cant. It must be thought on: if it passe against vs, We loose the better halfe of our Possession: For all the Temporall Lands, which men deuout By Testament haue giuen to the Church, Would they strip from vs; being valu'd thus, As much as would maintaine, to the Kings honor, Full fifteene Earles, and fifteene hundred Knights, Six thousand and two hundred good Esquires: And to reliefe of Lazars, and weake age Of indigent faint Soules, past corporall toyle, A hundred Almes-houses, right well supply'd: And to the Coffers of the King beside, A thousand pounds by th' yeere. Thus runs the Bill Ely. This would drinke deepe Cant. 'Twould drinke the Cup and all Ely. But what preuention? Cant. The King is full of grace, and faire regard Ely. And a true louer of the holy Church Cant. The courses of his youth promis'd it not. The breath no sooner left his Fathers body, But that his wildnesse, mortify'd in him, Seem'd to dye too: yea, at that very moment, Consideration like an Angell came, And whipt th' offending Adam out of him; Leauing his body as a Paradise, T' inuelop and containe Celestiall Spirits. Neuer was such a sodaine Scholler made: Neuer came Reformation in a Flood, With such a heady currance scowring faults: Nor neuer Hidra-headed Wilfulnesse So soone did loose his Seat; and all at once; As in this King Ely. We are blessed in the Change Cant. Heare him but reason in Diuinitie; And all-admiring, with an inward wish You would desire the King were made a Prelate: Heare him debate of Common-wealth Affaires; You would say, it hath been all in all his study: List his discourse of Warre; and you shall heare A fearefull Battaile rendred you in Musique. Turne him to any Cause of Pollicy, The Gordian Knot of it he will vnloose, Familiar as his Garter: that when he speakes, The Ayre, a Charter'd Libertine, is still, And the mute Wonder lurketh in mens eares, To steale his sweet and honyed Sentences: So that the Art and Practique part of Life, Must be the Mistresse to this Theorique. Which is a wonder how his Grace should gleane it, Since his addiction was to Courses vaine, His Companies vnletter'd, rude, and shallow, His Houres fill'd vp with Ryots, Banquets, Sports; And neuer noted in him any studie, Any retyrement, any sequestration, From open Haunts and Popularitie Ely. The Strawberry growes vnderneath the Nettle, And holesome Berryes thriue and ripen best, Neighbour'd by Fruit of baser qualitie: And so the Prince obscur'd his Contemplation Vnder the Veyle of Wildnesse, which (no doubt) Grew like the Summer Grasse, fastest by Night, Vnseene, yet cressiue in his facultie Cant. It must be so; for Miracles are ceast: And therefore we must needes admit the meanes, How things are perfected Ely. But my good Lord: How now for mittigation of this Bill, Vrg'd by the Commons? doth his Maiestie Incline to it, or no? Cant. He seemes indifferent: Or rather swaying more vpon our part, Then cherishing th' exhibiters against vs: For I haue made an offer to his Maiestie, Vpon our Spirituall Conuocation, And in regard of Causes now in hand, Which I haue open'd to his Grace at large, As touching France, to giue a greater Summe, Then euer at one time the Clergie yet Did to his Predecessors part withall Ely. How did this offer seeme receiu'd, my Lord? Cant. With good acceptance of his Maiestie: Saue that there was not time enough to heare, As I perceiu'd his Grace would faine haue done, The seueralls and vnhidden passages Of his true Titles to some certaine Dukedomes, And generally, to the Crowne and Seat of France, Deriu'd from Edward, his great Grandfather Ely. What was th' impediment that broke this off? Cant. The French Embassador vpon that instant Crau'd audience; and the howre I thinke is come, To giue him hearing: Is it foure a Clock? Ely. It is Cant. Then goe we in, to know his Embassie: Which I could with a ready guesse declare, Before the Frenchman speake a word of it Ely. Ile wait vpon you, and I long to heare it. Westmerland, and Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury? Not here in presence Send for him, good Vnckle Shall we call in th' Ambassador, my Liege? Not yet, my Cousin: we would be resolu'd, Before we heare him, of some things of weight, That taske our thoughts, concerning vs and France. Cant. God and his Angels guard your sacred Throne, And make you long become it Sure we thanke you. My learned Lord, we pray you to proceed, And iustly and religiously vnfold, Why the Law Salike, that they haue in France, Or should or should not barre vs in our Clayme: And God forbid, my deare and faithfull Lord, That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading, Or nicely charge your vnderstanding Soule, With opening Titles miscreate, whose right Sutes not in natiue colours with the truth: For God doth know, how many now in health, Shall drop their blood, in approbation Of what your reuerence shall incite vs to. Therefore take heed how you impawne our Person, How you awake our sleeping Sword of Warre; We charge you in the Name of God take heed: For neuer two such Kingdomes did contend, Without much fall of blood, whose guiltlesse drops Are euery one, a Woe, a sore Complaint, 'Gainst him, whose wrongs giues edge vnto the Swords, That makes such waste in briefe mortalitie. Vnder this Coniuration, speake my Lord: For we will heare, note, and beleeue in heart, That what you speake, is in your Conscience washt, As pure as sinne with Baptisme Can. Then heare me gracious Soueraign, & you Peers, That owe your selues, your liues, and seruices, To this Imperiall Throne. There is no barre To make against your Highnesse Clayme to France, But this which they produce from Pharamond, In terram Salicam Mulieres ne succedant, No Woman shall succeed in Salike Land: Which Salike Land, the French vniustly gloze To be the Realme of France, and Pharamond The founder of this Law, and Female Barre. Yet their owne Authors faithfully affirme, That the Land Salike is in Germanie, Betweene the Flouds of Sala and of Elue: Where Charles the Great hauing subdu'd the Saxons, There left behind and settled certaine French: Who holding in disdaine the German Women, For some dishonest manners of their life, Establisht then this Law; to wit, No Female Should be Inheritrix in Salike Land: Which Salike (as I said) 'twixt Elue and Sala, Is at this day in Germanie, call'd Meisen. Then doth it well appeare, the Salike Law Was not deuised for the Realme of France: Nor did the French possesse the Salike Land, Vntill foure hundred one and twentie yeeres After defunction of King Pharamond, Idly suppos'd the founder of this Law, Who died within the yeere of our Redemption, Foure hundred twentie six: and Charles the Great Subdu'd the Saxons, and did seat the French Beyond the Riuer Sala, in the yeere Eight hundred fiue. Besides, their Writers say, King Pepin, which deposed Childerike, Did as Heire Generall, being descended Of Blithild, which was Daughter to King Clothair, Make Clayme and Title to the Crowne of France. Hugh Capet also, who vsurpt the Crowne Of Charles the Duke of Loraine, sole Heire male Of the true Line and Stock of Charles the Great: To find his Title with some shewes of truth, Though in pure truth it was corrupt and naught, Conuey'd himselfe as th' Heire to th' Lady Lingare, Daughter to Charlemaine, who was the Sonne To Lewes the Emperour, and Lewes the Sonne Of Charles the Great: also King Lewes the Tenth, Who was sole Heire to the Vsurper Capet, Could not keepe quiet in his conscience, Wearing the Crowne of France, 'till satisfied, That faire Queene Isabel, his Grandmother, Was Lineall of the Lady Ermengare, Daughter to Charles the foresaid Duke of Loraine: By the which Marriage, the Lyne of Charles the Great Was re-vnited to the Crowne of France. So, that as cleare as is the Summers Sunne, King Pepins Title, and Hugh Capets Clayme, King Lewes his satisfaction, all appeare To hold in Right and Title of the Female: So doe the Kings of France vnto this day. Howbeit, they would hold vp this Salique Law, To barre your Highnesse clayming from the Female, And rather chuse to hide them in a Net, Then amply to imbarre their crooked Titles, Vsurpt from you and your Progenitors May I with right and conscience make this claim? Cant. The sinne vpon my head, dread Soueraigne: For in the Booke of Numbers is it writ, When the man dyes, let the Inheritance Descend vnto the Daughter. Gracious Lord, Stand for your owne, vnwind your bloody Flagge, Looke back into your mightie Ancestors: Goe my dread Lord, to your great Grandsires Tombe, From whom you clayme; inuoke his Warlike Spirit, And your Great Vnckles, Edward the Black Prince, Who on the French ground play'd a Tragedie, Making defeat on the full Power of France: Whiles his most mightie Father on a Hill Stood smiling, to behold his Lyons Whelpe Forrage in blood of French Nobilitie. O Noble English, that could entertaine With halfe their Forces, the full pride of France, And let another halfe stand laughing by, All out of worke, and cold for action Awake remembrance of these valiant dead, And with your puissant Arme renew their Feats; You are their Heire, you sit vpon their Throne: The Blood and Courage that renowned them, Runs in your Veines: and my thrice-puissant Liege Is in the very May-Morne of his Youth, Ripe for Exploits and mightie Enterprises Your Brother Kings and Monarchs of the Earth Doe all expect, that you should rowse your selfe, As did the former Lyons of your Blood They know your Grace hath cause, and means, and might; So hath your Highnesse: neuer King of England Had Nobles richer, and more loyall Subiects, Whose hearts haue left their bodyes here in England, And lye pauillion'd in the fields of France Can. O let their bodyes follow my deare Liege With Bloods, and Sword and Fire, to win your Right: In ayde whereof, we of the Spiritualtie Will rayse your Highnesse such a mightie Summe, As neuer did the Clergie at one time Bring in to any of your Ancestors We must not onely arme t' inuade the French, But lay downe our proportions, to defend Against the Scot, who will make roade vpon vs, With all aduantages Can. They of those Marches, gracious Soueraign, Shall be a Wall sufficient to defend Our in-land from the pilfering Borderers We do not meane the coursing snatchers onely, But feare the maine intendment of the Scot, Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to vs: For you shall reade, that my great Grandfather Neuer went with his forces into France, But that the Scot, on his vnfurnisht Kingdome, Came pouring like the Tyde into a breach, With ample and brim fulnesse of his force, Galling the gleaned Land with hot Assayes, Girding with grieuous siege, Castles and Townes: That England being emptie of defence, Hath shooke and trembled at th' ill neighbourhood Can. She hath bin the more fear'd the harm'd, my Liege: For heare her but exampl'd by her selfe, When all her Cheualrie hath been in France, And shee a mourning Widdow of her Nobles, Shee hath her selfe not onely well defended, But taken and impounded as a Stray, The King of Scots: whom shee did send to France, To fill King Edwards fame with prisoner Kings, And make their Chronicle as rich with prayse, As is the Owse and bottome of the Sea With sunken Wrack, and sum-lesse Treasuries Ely. But there's a saying very old and true, If that you will France win, then with Scotland first begin. For once the Eagle (England) being in prey, To her vnguarded Nest, the Weazell (Scot) Comes sneaking, and so sucks her Princely Egges, Playing the Mouse in absence of the Cat, To tame and hauocke more then she can eate It followes then, the Cat must stay at home, Yet that is but a crush'd necessity, Since we haue lockes to safegard necessaries, And pretty traps to catch the petty theeues. While that the Armed hand doth fight abroad, Th' aduised head defends it selfe at home: For Gouernment, though high, and low, and lower, Put into parts, doth keepe in one consent, Congreeing in a full and natural close, Like Musicke Therefore doth heauen diuide The state of man in diuers functions, Setting endeuour in continual motion: To which is fixed as an ayme or butt, Obedience: for so worke the Hony Bees, Creatures that by a rule in Nature teach The Act of Order to a peopled Kingdome. They haue a King, and Officers of sorts, Where some like Magistrates correct at home: Others, like Merchants venter Trade abroad: Others, like Souldiers armed in their stings, Make boote vpon the Summers Veluet buddes: Which pillage, they with merry march bring home To the Tent-royal of their Emperor: Who busied in his Maiesties surueyes The singing Masons building roofes of Gold, The ciuil Citizens kneading vp the hony; The poore Mechanicke Porters, crowding in Their heauy burthens at his narrow gate: The sad-ey'd Iustice with his surly humme, Deliuering ore to Executors pale The lazie yawning Drone: I this inferre, That many things hauing full reference To one consent, may worke contrariously, As many Arrowes loosed seuerall wayes Come to one marke: as many wayes meet in one towne, As many fresh streames meet in one salt sea; As many Lynes close in the Dials center: So may a thousand actions once a foote, And in one purpose, and be all well borne Without defeat. Therefore to France, my Liege, Diuide your happy England into foure, Whereof, take you one quarter into France, And you withall shall make all Gallia shake. If we with thrice such powers left at home, Cannot defend our owne doores from the dogge, Let vs be worried, and our Nation lose The name of hardinesse and policie Call in the Messengers sent from the Dolphin. Now are we well resolu'd, and by Gods helpe And yours, the noble sinewes of our power, France being ours, wee'l bend it to our Awe, Or breake it all to peeces. Or there wee'l sit, (Ruling in large and ample Emperie, Ore France, and all her (almost) Kingly Dukedomes) Or lay these bones in an vnworthy Vrne, Tomblesse, with no remembrance ouer them: Either our History shall with full mouth Speake freely of our Acts, or else our graue Like Turkish mute, shall haue a tonguelesse mouth, Not worshipt with a waxen Epitaph. Now are we well prepar'd to know the pleasure Of our faire Cosin Dolphin: for we heare, Your greeting is from him, not from the King May't please your Maiestie to giue vs leaue Freely to render what we haue in charge: Or shall we sparingly shew you farre off The Dolphins meaning, and our Embassie We are no Tyrant, but a Christian King, Vnto whose grace our passion is as subiect As is our wretches fettred in our prisons, Therefore with franke and with vncurbed plainnesse, Tell vs the Dolphins minde Thus than in few: Your Highnesse lately sending into France, Did claime some certaine Dukedomes, in the right Of your great Predecessor, King Edward the third. In answer of which claime, the Prince our Master Sayes, that you sauour too much of your youth, And bids you be aduis'd: There's nought in France, That can be with a nimble Galliard wonne: You cannot reuell into Dukedomes there. He therefore sends you meeter for your spirit This Tun of Treasure; and in lieu of this, Desires you let the dukedomes that you claime Heare no more of you. This the Dolphin speakes What Treasure Vncle? Tennis balles, my Liege We are glad the Dolphin is so pleasant with vs, His Present, and your paines we thanke you for: When we haue matcht our Rackets to these Balles, We will in France (by Gods grace) play a set, Shall strike his fathers Crowne into the hazard. Tell him, he hath made a match with such a Wrangler, That all the Courts of France will be disturb'd With Chaces. And we vnderstand him well, How he comes o're vs with our wilder dayes, Not measuring what vse we made of them. We neuer valew'd this poore seate of England, And therefore liuing hence, did giue our selfe To barbarous license: As 'tis euer common, That men are merriest, when they are from home. But tell the Dolphin, I will keepe my State, Be like a King, and shew my sayle of Greatnesse, When I do rowse me in my Throne of France. For that I haue layd by my Maiestie, And plodded like a man for working dayes: But I will rise there with so full a glorie, That I will dazle all the eyes of France, Yea strike the Dolphin blinde to looke on vs, And tell the pleasant Prince, this Mocke of his Hath turn'd his balles to Gun-stones, and his soule Shall stand sore charged, for the wastefull vengeance That shall flye with them: for many a thousand widows Shall this his Mocke, mocke out of their deer husbands; Mocke mothers from their sonnes, mock Castles downe: And some are yet vngotten and vnborne, That shal haue cause to curse the Dolphins scorne. But this lyes all within the wil of God, To whom I do appeale, and in whose name Tel you the Dolphin, I am comming on, To venge me as I may, and to put forth My rightfull hand in a wel-hallow'd cause. So get you hence in peace: And tell the Dolphin, His Iest will sauour but of shallow wit, When thousands weepe more then did laugh at it. Conuey them with safe conduct. Fare you well. This was a merry Message We hope to make the Sender blush at it: Therefore, my Lords, omit no happy howre, That may giue furth'rance to our Expedition: For we haue now no thought in vs but France, Saue those to God, that runne before our businesse. Therefore let our proportions for these Warres Be soone collected, and all things thought vpon, That may with reasonable swiftnesse adde More Feathers to our Wings: for God before, Wee'le chide this Dolphin at his fathers doore. Therefore let euery man now taske his thought, That this faire Action may on foot be brought. Now all the Youth of England are on fire, And silken Dalliance in the Wardrobe lyes: Now thriue the Armorers, and Honors thought Reignes solely in the breast of euery man. They sell the Pasture now, to buy the Horse; Following the Mirror of all Christian Kings, With winged heeles, as English Mercuries. For now sits Expectation in the Ayre, And hides a Sword, from Hilts vnto the Point, With Crownes Imperiall, Crownes and Coronets, Promis'd to Harry, and his followers. The French aduis'd by good intelligence Of this most dreadfull preparation, Shake in their feare, and with pale Pollicy Seeke to diuert the English purposes. O England: Modell to thy inward Greatnesse, Like little Body with a mightie Heart: What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do, Were all thy children kinde and naturall: But see, thy fault France hath in thee found out, A nest of hollow bosomes, which he filles With treacherous Crownes, and three corrupted men: One, Richard Earle of Cambridge, and the second Henry Lord Scroope of Masham, and the third Sir Thomas Grey Knight of Northumberland, Haue for the Gilt of France (O guilt indeed) Confirm'd Conspiracy with fearefull France, And by their hands, this grace of Kings must dye. If Hell and Treason hold their promises, Ere he take ship for France; and in Southampton. Linger your patience on, and wee'l digest Th' abuse of distance; force a play: The summe is payde, the Traitors are agreed, The King is set from London, and the Scene Is now transported (Gentles) to Southampton, There is the Play-house now, there must you sit, And thence to France shall we conuey you safe, And bring you backe: Charming the narrow seas To giue you gentle Passe: for if we may, Wee'l not offend one stomacke with our Play. But till the King come forth, and not till then, Vnto Southampton do we shift our Scene. Well met Corporall Nym Good morrow Lieutenant Bardolfe What, are Ancient Pistoll and you friends yet? Nym. For my part, I care not: I say little: but when time shall serue, there shall be smiles, but that shall be as it may. I dare not fight, but I will winke and holde out mine yron: it is a simple one, but what though?

Enter Pistoll, & Quickly. Heere comes Ancient Pistoll and his wife: good Corporall be patient heere. How now mine Hoaste Pistoll?

I do retort the solus in thy bowels, for I can take, and Pistols cocke is vp, and flashing fire will follow I am not Barbason, you cannot coniure mee: I haue an humor to knocke you indifferently well: If you grow fowle with me Pistoll, I will scoure you with my Rapier, as I may, in fayre tearmes.

Sound Trumpets. Now sits the winde faire, and we will aboord. My Lord of Cambridge, and my kinde Lord of Masham, And you my gentle Knight, giue me your thoughts: Thinke you not that the powres we beare with vs Will cut their passage through the force of France? Doing the execution, and the acte, For which we haue in head assembled them No doubt my Liege, if each man do his best I doubt not that, since we are well perswaded We carry not a heart with vs from hence, That growes not in a faire consent with ours: Nor leaue not one behinde, that doth not wish Successe and Conquest to attend on vs Neuer was Monarch better fear'd and lou'd, Then is your Maiesty; there's not I thinke a subiect That sits in heart-greefe and vneasinesse Vnder the sweet shade of your gouernment True: those that were your Fathers enemies, Haue steep'd their gauls in hony, and do serue you With hearts create of duty, and of zeale We therefore haue great cause of thankfulnes, And shall forget the office of our hand Sooner then quittance of desert and merit, According to the weight and worthinesse So seruice shall with steeled sinewes toyle, And labour shall refresh it selfe with hope To do your Grace incessant seruices We Iudge no lesse.

My Lord of Westmerland, and Vnkle Exeter, We will aboord to night. Why how now Gentlemen? What see you in those papers, that you loose So much complexion? Looke ye how they change: Their cheekes are paper. Why, what reade you there, That haue so cowarded and chac'd your blood Out of apparance I do confesse my fault, And do submit me to your Highnesse mercy Scro. To which we all appeale The mercy that was quicke in vs but late, By your owne counsaile is supprest and kill'd: You must not dare (for shame) to talke of mercy, For your owne reasons turne into your bosomes, As dogs vpon their maisters, worrying you: See you my Princes, and my Noble Peeres, These English monsters: My Lord of Cambridge heere, You know how apt our loue was, to accord To furnish with all appertinents Belonging to his Honour; and this man, Hath for a few light Crownes, lightly conspir'd And sworne vnto the practises of France To kill vs heere in Hampton. To the which, This Knight no lesse for bounty bound to Vs Then Cambridge is, hath likewise sworne. But O, What shall I say to thee Lord Scroope, thou cruell, Ingratefull, sauage, and inhumane Creature? Thou that didst beare the key of all my counsailes, That knew'st the very bottome of my soule, That (almost) might'st haue coyn'd me into Golde, Would'st thou haue practis'd on me, for thy vse? May it be possible, that forraigne hyer Could out of thee extract one sparke of euill That might annoy my finger? 'Tis so strange, That though the truth of it stands off as grosse As black and white, my eye will scarsely see it. Treason, and murther, euer kept together, As two yoake diuels sworne to eythers purpose, Working so grossely in an naturall cause, That admiration did not hoope at them. But thou (gainst all proportion) didst bring in Wonder to waite on treason, and on murther: And whatsoeuer cunning fiend it was That wrought vpon thee so preposterously, Hath got the voyce in hell for excellence: And other diuels that suggest by treasons, Do botch and bungle vp damnation, With patches, colours, and with formes being fetcht From glist'ring semblances of piety: But he that temper'd thee, bad thee stand vp, Gaue thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason, Vnlesse to dub thee with the name of Traitor. If that same Daemon that hath gull'd thee thus, Should with his Lyon-gate walke the whole world, He might returne to vastie Tartar backe, And tell the Legions, I can neuer win A soule so easie as that Englishmans. Oh, how hast thou with iealousie infected The sweetnesse of affiance? Shew men dutifull, Why so didst thou: seeme they graue and learned? Why so didst thou. Come they of Noble Family? Why so didst thou. Seeme they religious? Why so didst thou. Or are they spare in diet, Free from grosse passion, or of mirth, or anger, Constant in spirit, not sweruing with the blood, Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement, Not working with the eye, without the eare, And but in purged iudgement trusting neither, Such and so finely boulted didst thou seeme: And thus thy fall hath left a kinde of blot, To make thee full fraught man, and best indued With some suspition, I will weepe for thee. For this reuolt of thine, me thinkes is like Another fall of Man. Their faults are open, Arrest them to the answer of the Law, And God acquit them of their practises I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of Richard Earle of Cambridge. I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of Thomas Lord Scroope of Marsham. I arrest thee of High Treason, by the name of Thomas Grey, Knight of Northumberland Our purposes, God iustly hath discouer'd, And I repent my fault more then my death, Which I beseech your Highnesse to forgiue, Although my body pay the price of it For me, the Gold of France did not seduce, Although I did admit it as a motiue, The sooner to effect what I intended: But God be thanked for preuention, Which in sufferance heartily will reioyce, Beseeching God, and you, to pardon mee Neuer did faithfull subiect more reioyce At the discouery of most dangerous Treason, Then I do at this houre ioy ore my selfe, Preuented from a damned enterprize; My fault, but not my body, pardon Soueraigne God quit you in his mercy: Hear your sentence You haue conspir'd against Our Royall person, Ioyn'd with an enemy proclaim'd, and from his Coffers, Receyu'd the Golden Earnest of Our death: Wherein you would haue sold your King to slaughter, His Princes, and his Peeres to seruitude, His Subiects to oppression, and contempt, And his whole Kingdome into desolation: Touching our person, seeke we no reuenge, But we our Kingdomes safety must so tender, Whose ruine you sought, that to her Lawes We do deliuer you. Get you therefore hence, (Poore miserable wretches) to your death: The taste whereof, God of his mercy giue You patience to indure, and true Repentance Of all your deare offences. Beare them hence. Now Lords for France: the enterprise whereof Shall be to you as vs, like glorious. We doubt not of a faire and luckie Warre, Since God so graciously hath brought to light This dangerous Treason, lurking in our way, To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now, But euery Rubbe is smoothed on our way. Then forth, deare Countreymen: Let vs deliuer Our Puissance into the hand of God, Putting it straight in expedition. Chearely to Sea, the signes of Warre aduance, No King of England, if not King of France. 'Prythee honey sweet Husband, let me bring thee to Staines No: for my manly heart doth erne. Bardolph, be blythe: Nim, rowse thy vaunting Veines: Boy, brissle thy Courage vp: for Falstaffe hee is dead, and wee must erne therefore Would I were with him, wheresomere hee is, eyther in Heauen, or in Hell Nay sure, hee's not in Hell: hee's in Arthurs Bosome, if euer man went to Arthurs Bosome: a made a finer end, and went away and it had beene any Christome Childe: a parted eu'n iust betweene Twelue and One, eu'n at the turning o'th' Tyde: for after I saw him fumble with the Sheets, and play with Flowers, and smile vpon his fingers end, I knew there was but one way: for his Nose was as sharpe as a Pen, and a Table of greene fields. How now Sir Iohn (quoth I?) what man? be a good cheare: so a cryed out, God, God, God, three or foure times: now I, to comfort him, bid him a should not thinke of God; I hop'd there was no neede to trouble himselfe with any such thoughts yet: so a bad me lay more Clothes on his feet: I put my hand into the Bed, and felt them, and they were as cold as any stone: then I felt to his knees, and so vp-peer'd, and vpward, and all was as cold as any stone They say he cryed out of Sack I, that a did And of Women Nay, that a did not Yes that a did, and said they were Deules incarnate A could neuer abide Carnation, 'twas a Colour he neuer lik'd A said once, the Deule would haue him about Women A did in some sort (indeed) handle Women: but then hee was rumatique, and talk'd of the Whore of Babylon Doe you not remember a saw a Flea sticke vpon Bardolphs Nose, and a said it was a blacke Soule burning in Hell Well, the fuell is gone that maintain'd that fire: that's all the Riches I got in his seruice Shall wee shogg? the King will be gone from Southampton Come, let's away. My Loue, giue me thy Lippes: Looke to my Chattels, and my Moueables: Let Sences rule: The world is, Pitch and pay: trust none: for Oathes are Strawes, mens Faiths are Wafer-Cakes, and hold-fast is the onely Dogge: My Ducke, therefore Caueto bee thy Goe, cleare thy Chrystalls. Yokefellowes in Armes, let vs to France, like Horseleeches my Boyes, to sucke, to sucke, the very blood to sucke And that's but vnwholesome food, they say Touch her soft mouth, and march Farwell Hostesse I cannot kisse, that is the humor of it: but adieu Let Huswiferie appeare: keepe close, I thee command Farwell: adieu. Thus comes the English with full power vpon vs, And more then carefully it vs concernes, To answer Royally in our defences. Therefore the Dukes of Berry and of Britaine, Of Brabant and of Orleance, shall make forth, And you Prince Dolphin, with all swift dispatch To lyne and new repayre our Townes of Warre With men of courage, and with meanes defendant: For England his approaches makes as fierce, As Waters to the sucking of a Gulfe. It fits vs then to be as prouident, As feare may teach vs, out of late examples Left by the fatall and neglected English, Vpon our fields My most redoubted Father, It is most meet we arme vs 'gainst the Foe: For Peace it selfe should not so dull a Kingdome, (Though War nor no knowne Quarrel were in question) But that Defences, Musters, Preparations, Should be maintain'd, assembled, and collected, As were a Warre in expectation. Therefore I say, 'tis meet we all goe forth, To view the sick and feeble parts of France: And let vs doe it with no shew of feare, No, with no more, then if we heard that England Were busied with a Whitson Morris-dance: For, my good Liege, shee is so idly King'd, Her Scepter so phantastically borne, By a vaine giddie shallow humorous Youth, That feare attends her not O peace, Prince Dolphin, You are too much mistaken in this King: Question your Grace the late Embassadors, With what great State he heard their Embassie, How well supply'd with Noble Councellors, How modest in exception; and withall, How terrible in constant resolution: And you shall find, his Vanities fore-spent, Were but the out-side of the Roman Brutus, Couering Discretion with a Coat of Folly; As Gardeners doe with Ordure hide those Roots That shall first spring, and be most delicate Well, 'tis not so, my Lord High Constable. But though we thinke it so, it is no matter: In cases of defence, 'tis best to weigh The Enemie more mightie then he seemes, So the proportions of defence are fill'd: Which of a weake and niggardly proiection, Doth like a Miser spoyle his Coat, with scanting A little Cloth Thinke we King Harry strong: And Princes, looke you strongly arme to meet him. The Kindred of him hath beene flesht vpon vs: And he is bred out of that bloodie straine, That haunted vs in our familiar Pathes: Witnesse our too much memorable shame, When Cressy Battell fatally was strucke, And all our Princes captiu'd, by the hand Of that black Name, Edward, black Prince of Wales: Whiles that his Mountaine Sire, on Mountaine standing Vp in the Ayre, crown'd with the Golden Sunne, Saw his Heroicall Seed, and smil'd to see him Mangle the Worke of Nature, and deface The Patternes, that by God and by French Fathers Had twentie yeeres been made. This is a Stem Of that Victorious Stock: and let vs feare The Natiue mightinesse and fate of him. Embassadors from Harry King of England, Doe craue admittance to your Maiestie Weele giue them present audience. Goe, and bring them. You see this Chase is hotly followed, friends Turne head, and stop pursuit: for coward Dogs Most spend their mouths, whe what they seem to threaten Runs farre before them. Good my Soueraigne Take vp the English short, and let them know Of what a Monarchie you are the Head: Selfe-loue, my Liege, is not so vile a sinne, As selfe-neglecting. From our Brother of England? From him, and thus he greets your Maiestie: He wills you in the Name of God Almightie, That you deuest your selfe, and lay apart The borrowed Glories, that by gift of Heauen, By Law of Nature, and of Nations, longs To him and to his Heires, namely, the Crowne, And all wide-stretched Honors, that pertaine By Custome, and the Ordinance of Times, Vnto the Crowne of France: that you may know 'Tis no sinister, nor no awkward Clayme, Pickt from the worme-holes of long-vanisht dayes, Nor from the dust of old Obliuion rakt, He sends you this most memorable Lyne, In euery Branch truly demonstratiue; Willing you ouer-looke this Pedigree: And when you find him euenly deriu'd From his most fam'd, of famous Ancestors, Edward the third; he bids you then resigne Your Crowne and Kingdome, indirectly held From him, the Natiue and true Challenger Or else what followes? Bloody constraint: for if you hide the Crowne Euen in your hearts, there will he rake for it. Therefore in fierce Tempest is he comming, In Thunder and in Earth-quake, like a Ioue: That if requiring faile, he will compell. And bids you, in the Bowels of the Lord, Deliuer vp the Crowne, and to take mercie On the poore Soules, for whom this hungry Warre Opens his vastie Iawes: and on your head Turning the Widdowes Teares, the Orphans Cryes, The dead-mens Blood, the priuy Maidens Groanes, For Husbands, Fathers, and betrothed Louers, That shall be swallowed in this Controuersie. This is his Clayme, his Threatning, and my Message: Vnlesse the Dolphin be in presence here; To whom expressely I bring greeting to For vs, we will consider of this further: To morrow shall you beare our full intent Back to our Brother of England For the Dolphin, I stand here for him: what to him from England? Scorne and defiance, sleight regard, contempt, And any thing that may not mis-become The mightie Sender, doth he prize you at. Thus sayes my King: and if your Fathers Highnesse Doe not, in graunt of all demands at large, Sweeten the bitter Mock you sent his Maiestie; Hee'le call you to so hot an Answer of it, That Caues and Wombie Vaultages of France Shall chide your Trespas, and returne your Mock In second Accent of his Ordinance Say: if my Father render faire returne, It is against my will: for I desire Nothing but Oddes with England. To that end, as matching to his Youth and Vanitie, I did present him with the Paris-Balls Hee'le make your Paris Louer shake for it, Were it the Mistresse Court of mightie Europe: And be assur'd, you'le find a diff'rence, As we his Subiects haue in wonder found, Betweene the promise of his greener dayes, And these he masters now: now he weighes Time Euen to the vtmost Graine: that you shall reade In your owne Losses, if he stay in France To morrow shall you know our mind at full. Dispatch vs with all speed, least that our King Come here himselfe to question our delay; For he is footed in this Land already You shalbe soone dispatcht, with faire conditions. A Night is but small breathe, and little pawse, To answer matters of this consequence. Thus with imagin'd wing our swift Scene flyes, In motion of no lesse celeritie then that of Thought. Suppose, that you haue seene The well-appointed King at Douer Peer, Embarke his Royaltie: and his braue Fleet, With silken Streamers, the young Phebus fayning; Play with your Fancies: and in them behold, Vpon the Hempen Tackle, Ship-boyes climbing; Heare the shrill Whistle, which doth order giue To sounds confus'd: behold the threaden Sayles, Borne with th' inuisible and creeping Wind, Draw the huge Bottomes through the furrowed Sea, Bresting the loftie Surge. O, doe but thinke You stand vpon the Riuage, and behold A Citie on th' inconstant Billowes dauncing: For so appeares this Fleet Maiesticall, Holding due course to Harflew. Follow, follow: Grapple your minds to sternage of this Nauie, And leaue your England as dead Mid-night, still, Guarded with Grandsires, Babyes, and old Women, Eyther past, or not arriu'd to pyth and puissance: For who is he, whose Chin is but enricht With one appearing Hayre, that will not follow These cull'd and choyse-drawne Caualiers to France? Worke, worke your Thoughts, and therein see a Siege: Behold the Ordenance on their Carriages, With fatall mouthes gaping on girded Harflew. Suppose th' Embassador from the French comes back: Tells Harry, That the King doth offer him Katherine his Daughter, and with her to Dowrie, Some petty and vnprofitable Dukedomes. The offer likes not: and the nimble Gunner With Lynstock now the diuellish Cannon touches, And downe goes all before them. Still be kind, And eech out our performance with your mind. Ladders at Harflew. Once more vnto the Breach, Deare friends, once more; Or close the Wall vp with our English dead: In Peace, there's nothing so becomes a man, As modest stillnesse, and humilitie: But when the blast of Warre blowes in our eares, Then imitate the action of the Tyger: Stiffen the sinewes, commune vp the blood, Disguise faire Nature with hard-fauour'd Rage: Then lend the Eye a terrible aspect: Let it pry through the portage of the Head, Like the Brasse Cannon: let the Brow o'rewhelme it, As fearefully, as doth a galled Rocke O're-hang and iutty his confounded Base, Swill'd with the wild and wastfull Ocean. Now set the Teeth, and stretch the Nosthrill wide, Hold hard the Breath, and bend vp euery Spirit To his full height. On, on, you Noblish English, Whose blood is fet from Fathers of Warre-proofe: Fathers, that like so many Alexanders, Haue in these parts from Morne till Euen fought, And sheath'd their Swords, for lack of argument. Dishonour not your Mothers: now attest, That those whom you call'd Fathers, did beget you. Be Coppy now to men of grosser blood, And teach them how to Warre. And you good Yeomen, Whose Lyms were made in England; shew vs here The mettell of your Pasture: let vs sweare, That you are worth your breeding: which I doubt not: For there is none of you so meane and base, That hath not Noble luster in your eyes. I see you stand like Grey-hounds in the slips, Straying vpon the Start. The Game's afoot: Follow your Spirit; and vpon this Charge, Cry, God for Harry, England, and S. George. On, on, on, on, on, to the breach, to the breach 'Pray thee Corporall stay, the Knocks are too hot: and for mine owne part, I haue not a Case of Liues: the humor of it is too hot, that is the very plaine-Song of it The plaine-Song is most iust: for humors doe abound: Knocks goe and come: Gods Vassals drop and dye: and Sword and Shield, in bloody Field, doth winne immortall fame Would I were in a Ale-house in London, I would giue all my fame for a Pot of Ale, and safetie And I: If wishes would preuayle with me, my purpose should not fayle with me; but thither would I high As duly, but not as truly, as Bird doth sing on bough. Vp to the breach, you Dogges; auaunt you Cullions Be mercifull great Duke to men of Mould: abate thy Rage, abate thy manly Rage; abate thy Rage, great Duke. Good Bawcock bate thy Rage: vse lenitie sweet Chuck These be good humors: your Honor wins bad humors. As young as I am, I haue obseru'd these three Swashers: I am Boy to them all three, but all they three, though they would serue me, could not be Man to me; for indeed three such Antiques doe not amount to a man: for Bardolph, hee is white-liuer'd, and red-fac'd; by the meanes whereof, a faces it out, but fights not: for Pistoll, hee hath a killing Tongue, and a quiet Sword; by the meanes whereof, a breakes Words, and keepes whole Weapons: for Nim, hee hath heard, that men of few Words are the best men, and therefore hee scornes to say his Prayers, lest a should be thought a Coward: but his few bad Words are matcht with as few good Deeds; for a neuer broke any mans Head but his owne, and that was against a Post, when he was drunke. They will steale any thing, and call it Purchase. Bardolph stole a Lute-case, bore it twelue Leagues, and sold it for three halfepence. Nim and Bardolph are sworne Brothers in filching: and in Callice they stole a fire-shouell. I knew by that peece of Seruice, the men would carry Coales. They would haue me as familiar with mens Pockets, as their Gloues or their Hand-kerchers: which makes much against my Manhood, if I should take from anothers Pocket, to put into mine; for it is plaine pocketting vp of Wrongs. I must leaue them, and seeke some better Seruice: their Villany goes against my weake stomacke, and therefore I must cast it vp. Enter. Captaine Fluellen, you must come presently to the Mynes; the Duke of Gloucester would speake with you To the Mynes? Tell you the Duke, it is not so good to come to the Mynes: for looke you, the Mynes is not according to the disciplines of the Warre; the concauities of it is not sufficient: for looke you, th' athuersarie, you may discusse vnto the Duke, looke you, is digt himselfe foure yard vnder the Countermines: by Cheshu, I thinke a will plowe vp all, if there is not better directions The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the Order of the Siege is giuen, is altogether directed by an Irish man, a very valiant Gentleman yfaith It is Captaine Makmorrice, is it not? I thinke it be By Cheshu he is an Asse, as in the World, I will verifie as much in his Beard: he ha's no more directions in the true disciplines of the Warres, looke you, of the Roman disciplines, then is a Puppy-dog. Enter Makmorrice, and Captaine Iamy. Here a comes, and the Scots Captaine, Captaine Iamy, with him Captaine Iamy is a maruellous falorous Gentleman, that is certain, and of great expedition and knowledge in th' aunchiant Warres, vpon my particular knowledge of his directions: by Cheshu he will maintaine his Argument as well as any Militarie man in the World, in the disciplines of the Pristine Warres of the Romans I say gudday, Captaine Fluellen Godden to your Worship, good Captaine Iames How now Captaine Mackmorrice, haue you quit the Mynes? haue the Pioners giuen o're? Irish. By Chrish Law tish ill done: the Worke ish giue ouer, the Trompet sound the Retreat. By my Hand I sweare, and my fathers Soule, the Worke ish ill done: it ish giue ouer: I would haue blowed vp the Towne, so Chrish saue me law, in an houre. O tish ill done, tish ill done: by my Hand tish ill done Captaine Mackmorrice, I beseech you now, will you voutsafe me, looke you, a few disputations with you, as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of the Warre, the Roman Warres, in the way of Argument, looke you, and friendly communication: partly to satisfie my Opinion, and partly for the satisfaction, looke you, of my Mind: as touching the direction of the Militarie discipline, that is the Point It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud Captens bath, and I sall quit you with gud leue, as I may pick occasion: that sall I mary It is no time to discourse, so Chrish saue me: the day is hot, and the Weather, and the Warres, and the King, and the Dukes: it is no time to discourse, the Town is beseech'd: and the Trumpet call vs to the breech, and we talke, and be Chrish do nothing, tis shame for vs all: so God sa'me tis shame to stand still, it is shame by my hand: and there is Throats to be cut, and Workes to be done, and there ish nothing done, so Christ sa'me law By the Mes, ere theise eyes of mine take themselues to slomber, ayle de gud seruice, or Ile ligge i'th' grund for it; ay, or goe to death: and Ile pay't as valorously as I may, that sal I suerly do, that is the breff and the long: mary, I wad full faine heard some question tween you tway Captaine Mackmorrice, I thinke, looke you, vnder your correction, there is not many of your Nation Of my Nation? What ish my Nation? Ish a Villaine, and a Basterd, and a Knaue, and a Rascall. What ish my Nation? Who talkes of my Nation? Welch. Looke you, if you take the matter otherwise then is meant, Captaine Mackmorrice, peraduenture I shall thinke you doe not vse me with that affabilitie, as in discretion you ought to vse me, looke you, being as good a man as your selfe, both in the disciplines of Warre, and in the deriuation of my Birth, and in other particularities I doe not know you so good a man as my selfe: so Chrish saue me, I will cut off your Head Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other A, that's a foule fault. A Parley. The Towne sounds a Parley Captaine Mackmorrice, when there is more better oportunitie to be required, looke you, I will be so bold as to tell you, I know the disciplines of Warre: and there is an end. Enter. How yet resolues the Gouernour of the Towne? This is the latest Parle we will admit: Therefore to our best mercy giue your selues, Or like to men prowd of destruction, Defie vs to our worst: for as I am a Souldier, A Name that in my thoughts becomes me best; If I begin the batt'rie once againe, I will not leaue the halfe-atchieued Harflew, Till in her ashes she lye buryed. The Gates of Mercy shall be all shut vp, And the flesh'd Souldier, rough and hard of heart, In libertie of bloody hand, shall raunge With Conscience wide as Hell, mowing like Grasse Your fresh faire Virgins, and your flowring Infants. What is it then to me, if impious Warre, Arrayed in flames like to the Prince of Fiends, Doe with his smyrcht complexion all fell feats, Enlynckt to wast and desolation? What is't to me, when you your selues are cause, If your pure Maydens fall into the hand Of hot and forcing Violation? What Reyne can hold licentious Wickednesse, When downe the Hill he holds his fierce Carriere? We may as bootlesse spend our vaine Command Vpon th' enraged Souldiers in their spoyle, As send Precepts to the Leuiathan, to come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harflew, Take pitty of your Towne and of your People, Whiles yet my Souldiers are in my Command, Whiles yet the coole and temperate Wind of Grace O're-blowes the filthy and contagious Clouds Of heady Murther, Spoyle, and Villany. If not: why in a moment looke to see The blind and bloody Souldier, with foule hand Desire the Locks of your shrill-shriking Daughters: Your Fathers taken by the siluer Beards, And their most reuerend Heads dasht to the Walls: Your naked Infants spitted vpon Pykes, Whiles the mad Mothers, with their howles confus'd, Doe breake the Clouds; as did the Wiues of Iewry, At Herods bloody-hunting slaughter-men. What say you? Will you yeeld, and this auoyd? Or guiltie in defence, be thus destroy'd. Our expectation hath this day an end: The Dolphin, whom of Succours we entreated, Returnes vs, that his Powers are yet not ready, To rayse so great a Siege: Therefore great King, We yeeld our Towne and Liues to thy soft Mercy: For we no longer are defensible Open your Gates: Come Vnckle Exeter, Goe you and enter Harflew; there remaine, And fortifie it strongly 'gainst the French: Vse mercy to them all for vs, deare Vnckle. The Winter comming on, and Sicknesse growing Vpon our Souldiers, we will retyre to Calis. To night in Harflew will we be your Guest, To morrow for the March are we addrest.

Vp Princes, and with spirit of Honor edged, More sharper then your Swords, high to the field: Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France, You Dukes of Orleance, Burbon, and of Berry, Alanson, Brabant, Bar, and Burgonie, Iaques Chattillion, Rambures, Vandemont, Beumont, Grand Pree, Roussi, and Faulconbridge, Loys, Lestrale, Bouciquall, and Charaloyes, High Dukes, great Princes, Barons, Lords, and Kings; For your great Seats, now quit you of great shames: Barre Harry England, that sweepes through our Land With Penons painted in the blood of Harflew: Rush on his Hoast, as doth the melted Snow Vpon the Valleyes, whose low Vassall Seat, The Alpes doth spit, and void his rhewme vpon. Goe downe vpon him, you haue Power enough, And in a Captiue Chariot, into Roan Bring him our Prisoner This becomes the Great. Sorry am I his numbers are so few, His Souldiers sick, and famisht in their March: For I am sure, when he shall see our Army, Hee'le drop his heart into the sinck of feare, And for atchieuement, offer vs his Ransome Therefore Lord Constable, hast on Montioy, And let him say to England, that we send, To know what willing Ransome he will giue. Prince Dolphin, you shall stay with vs in Roan Not so, I doe beseech your Maiestie Be patient, for you shall remaine with vs. Now forth Lord Constable, and Princes all, And quickly bring vs word of Englands fall. How now Captaine Fluellen, come you from the Bridge? I assure you, there is very excellent Seruices committed at the Bridge Is the Duke of Exeter safe? Flu. The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon, and a man that I loue and honour with my soule, and my heart, and my dutie, and my liue, and my liuing, and my vttermost power. He is not, God be praysed and blessed, any hurt in the World, but keepes the Bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline. There is an aunchient Lieutenant there at the Pridge, I thinke in my very conscience hee is as valiant a man as Marke Anthony, and hee is a man of no estimation in the World, but I did see him doe as gallant seruice What doe you call him? Hee is call'd aunchient Pistoll I know him not. Here is the man Captaine, I thee beseech to doe me fauours: the Duke of Exeter doth loue thee well I, I prayse God, and I haue merited some loue at his hands Bardolph, a Souldier firme and sound of heart, and of buxome valour, hath by cruell Fate, and giddie Fortunes furious fickle Wheele, that Goddesse blind, that stands vpon the rolling restlesse Stone By your patience, aunchient Pistoll: Fortune is painted blinde, with a Muffler afore his eyes, to signifie to you, that Fortune is blinde; and shee is painted also with a Wheele, to signifie to you, which is the Morall of it, that shee is turning and inconstant, and mutabilitie, and variation: and her foot, looke you, is fixed vpon a Sphericall Stone, which rowles, and rowles, and rowles: in good truth, the Poet makes a most excellent description of it: Fortune is an excellent Morall Fortune is Bardolphs foe, and frownes on him: for he hath stolne a Pax, and hanged must a be: a damned death: let Gallowes gape for Dogge, let Man goe free, and let not Hempe his Wind-pipe suffocate: but Exeter hath giuen the doome of death, for Pax of little price. Therefore goe speake, the Duke will heare thy voyce; and let not Bardolphs vitall thred bee cut with edge of Penny-Cord, and vile reproach. Speake Captaine for his Life, and I will thee requite Aunchient Pistoll, I doe partly vnderstand your meaning Why then reioyce therefore Certainly Aunchient, it is not a thing to reioyce at: for if, looke you, he were my Brother, I would desire the Duke to vse his good pleasure, and put him to execution; for discipline ought to be vsed Dye, and be dam'd, and Figo for thy friendship It is well The Figge of Spaine. Very good Why, this is an arrant counterfeit Rascall, I remember him now: a Bawd, a Cut-purse Ile assure you, a vtt'red as praue words at the Pridge, as you shall see in a Summers day: but it is very well: what he ha's spoke to me, that is well I warrant you, when time is serue Why 'tis a Gull, a Foole, a Rogue, that now and then goes to the Warres, to grace himselfe at his returne into London, vnder the forme of a Souldier: and such fellowes are perfit in the Great Commanders Names, and they will learne you by rote where Seruices were done; at such and such a Sconce, at such a Breach, at such a Conuoy: who came off brauely, who was shot, who disgrac'd, what termes the Enemy stood on: and this they conne perfitly in the phrase of Warre; which they tricke vp with new-tuned Oathes: and what a Beard of the Generalls Cut, and a horride Sute of the Campe, will doe among foming Bottles, and Ale-washt Wits, is wonderfull to be thought on: but you must learne to know such slanders of the age, or else you may be maruellously mistooke I tell you what, Captaine Gower: I doe perceiue hee is not the man that hee would gladly make shew to the World hee is: if I finde a hole in his Coat, I will tell him my minde: hearke you, the King is comming, and I must speake with him from the Pridge. Drum and Colours. Enter the King and his poore Souldiers. God plesse your Maiestie How now Fluellen, cam'st thou from the Bridge? Flu. I, so please your Maiestie: The Duke of Exeter ha's very gallantly maintain'd the Pridge; the French is gone off, looke you, and there is gallant and most praue passages: marry, th' athuersarie was haue possession of the Pridge, but he is enforced to retyre, and the Duke of Exeter is Master of the Pridge: I can tell your Maiestie, the Duke is a praue man What men haue you lost, Fluellen? Flu. The perdition of th' athuersarie hath beene very great, reasonnable great: marry for my part, I thinke the Duke hath lost neuer a man, but one that is like to be executed for robbing a Church, one Bardolph, if your Maiestie know the man: his face is all bubukles and whelkes, and knobs, and flames a fire, and his lippes blowes at his nose, and it is like a coale of fire, sometimes plew, and sometimes red, but his nose is executed, and his fire's out Wee would haue all such offendors so cut off: and we giue expresse charge, that in our Marches through the Countrey, there be nothing compell'd from the Villages; nothing taken, but pay'd for: none of the French vpbrayded or abused in disdainefull Language; for when Leuitie and Crueltie play for a Kingdome, the gentler Gamester is the soonest winner. Enter Mountioy. You know me by my habit Well then, I know thee: what shall I know of thee? My Masters mind Vnfold it Thus sayes my King: Say thou to Harry of England, Though we seem'd dead, we did but sleepe: Aduantage is a better Souldier then rashnesse. Tell him, wee could haue rebuk'd him at Harflewe, but that wee thought not good to bruise an iniurie, till it were full ripe. Now wee speake vpon our Q. and our voyce is imperiall: England shall repent his folly, see his weakenesse, and admire our sufferance. Bid him therefore consider of his ransome, which must proportion the losses we haue borne, the subiects we haue lost, the disgrace we haue digested; which in weight to re-answer, his pettinesse would bow vnder. For our losses, his Exchequer is too poore; for th' effusion of our bloud, the Muster of his Kingdome too faint a number; and for our disgrace, his owne person kneeling at our feet, but a weake and worthlesse satisfaction. To this adde defiance: and tell him for conclusion, he hath betrayed his followers, whose condemnation is pronounc't: So farre my King and Master; so much my Office What is thy name? I know thy qualitie Mountioy Thou doo'st thy Office fairely. Turne thee backe, And tell thy King, I doe not seeke him now, But could be willing to march on to Callice, Without impeachment: for to say the sooth, Though 'tis no wisdome to confesse so much Vnto an enemie of Craft and Vantage, My people are with sicknesse much enfeebled, My numbers lessen'd: and those few I haue, Almost no better then so many French; Who when they were in health, I tell thee Herald, I thought, vpon one payre of English Legges Did march three Frenchmen. Yet forgiue me God, That I doe bragge thus; this your ayre of France Hath blowne that vice in me. I must repent: Goe therefore tell thy Master, heere I am; My Ransome, is this frayle and worthlesse Trunke; My Army, but a weake and sickly Guard: Yet God before, tell him we will come on, Though France himselfe, and such another Neighbor Stand in our way. There's for thy labour Mountioy. Goe bid thy Master well aduise himselfe. If we may passe, we will: if we be hindred, We shall your tawnie ground with your red blood Discolour: and so Mountioy, fare you well. The summe of all our Answer is but this: We would not seeke a Battaile as we are, Nor as we are, we say we will not shun it: So tell your Master I shall deliuer so: Thankes to your Highnesse I hope they will not come vpon vs now We are in Gods hand, Brother, not in theirs: March to the Bridge, it now drawes toward night, Beyond the Riuer wee'le encampe our selues, And on to morrow bid them march away. with others. Tut, I haue the best Armour of the World: would it were day You haue an excellent Armour: but let my Horse haue his due It is the best Horse of Europe Will it neuer be Morning? My Lord of Orleance, and my Lord High Constable, you talke of Horse and Armour? You are as well prouided of both, as any Prince in the World What a long Night is this? I will not change my Horse with any that treades but on foure postures: ch' ha: he bounds from the Earth, as if his entrayles were hayres: le Cheual volante, the Pegasus, ches les narines de feu. When I bestryde him, I soare, I am a Hawke: he trots the ayre: the Earth sings, when he touches it: the basest horne of his hoofe, is more Musicall then the Pipe of Hermes Hee's of the colour of the Nutmeg And of the heat of the Ginger. It is a Beast for Perseus: hee is pure Ayre and Fire; and the dull Elements of Earth and Water neuer appeare in him, but only in patient stillnesse while his Rider mounts him: hee is indeede a Horse, and all other Iades you may call Beasts Indeed my Lord, it is a most absolute and excellent Horse It is the Prince of Palfrayes, his Neigh is like the bidding of a Monarch, and his countenance enforces Homage No more Cousin Nay, the man hath no wit, that cannot from the rising of the Larke to the lodging of the Lambe, varie deserued prayse on my Palfray: it is a Theame as fluent as the Sea: Turne the Sands into eloquent tongues, and my Horse is argument for them all: 'tis a subiect for a Soueraigne to reason on, and for a Soueraignes Soueraigne to ride on: And for the World, familiar to vs, and vnknowne, to lay apart their particular Functions, and wonder at him, I once writ a Sonnet in his prayse, and began thus, Wonder of Nature I haue heard a Sonnet begin so to ones Mistresse Then did they imitate that which I compos'd to my Courser, for my Horse is my Mistresse Your Mistresse beares well Me well, which is the prescript prayse and perfection of a good and particular Mistresse Nay, for me thought yesterday your Mistresse shrewdly shooke your back So perhaps did yours Mine was not bridled O then belike she was old and gentle, and you rode like a Kerne of Ireland, your French Hose off, and in your strait Strossers You haue good iudgement in Horsemanship Be warn'd by me then: they that ride so, and ride not warily, fall into foule Boggs: I had rather haue my Horse to my Mistresse I had as liue haue my Mistresse a Iade I tell thee Constable, my Mistresse weares his owne hayre I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a Sow to my Mistresse Le chien est retourne a son propre vemissement est la leuye lauee au bourbier: thou mak'st vse of any thing Yet doe I not vse my Horse for my Mistresse, or any such Prouerbe, so little kin to the purpose My Lord Constable, the Armour that I saw in your Tent to night, are those Starres or Sunnes vpon it? Starres my Lord Some of them will fall to morrow, I hope And yet my Sky shall not want That may be, for you beare a many superfluously, and 'twere more honor some were away Eu'n as your Horse beares your prayses, who would trot as well, were some of your bragges dismounted Would I were able to loade him with his desert. Will it neuer be day? I will trot to morrow a mile, and my way shall be paued with English Faces I will not say so, for feare I should be fac't out of my way: but I would it were morning, for I would faine be about the eares of the English Who will goe to Hazard with me for twentie Prisoners? You must first goe your selfe to hazard, ere you haue them 'Tis Mid-night, Ile goe arme my selfe. The Dolphin longs for morning He longs to eate the English I thinke he will eate all he kills By the white Hand of my Lady, hee's a gallant Prince Sweare by her Foot, that she may tread out the Oath He is simply the most actiue Gentleman of France Doing is actiuitie, and he will still be doing He neuer did harme, that I heard of Nor will doe none to morrow: hee will keepe that good name still I know him to be valiant I was told that, by one that knowes him better then you What's hee? Marry hee told me so himselfe, and hee sayd hee car'd not who knew it Hee needes not, it is no hidden vertue in him By my faith Sir, but it is: neuer any body saw it, but his Lacquey: 'tis a hooded valour, and when it appeares, it will bate Ill will neuer sayd well I will cap that Prouerbe with, There is flatterie in friendship And I will take vp that with, Giue the Deuill his due Well plac't: there stands your friend for the Deuill: haue at the very eye of that Prouerbe with, A Pox of the Deuill You are the better at Prouerbs, by how much a Fooles Bolt is soone shot You haue shot ouer 'Tis not the first time you were ouer-shot. My Lord high Constable, the English lye within fifteene hundred paces of your Tents Who hath measur'd the ground? The Lord Grandpree A valiant and most expert Gentleman. Would it were day? Alas poore Harry of England: hee longs not for the Dawning, as wee doe What a wretched and peeuish fellow is this King of England, to mope with his fat-brain'd followers so farre out of his knowledge If the English had any apprehension, they would runne away That they lack: for if their heads had any intellectuall Armour, they could neuer weare such heauie Head-pieces That Iland of England breedes very valiant Creatures; their Mastiffes are of vnmatchable courage Foolish Curres, that runne winking into the mouth of a Russian Beare, and haue their heads crusht like rotten Apples: you may as well say, that's a valiant Flea, that dare eate his breakefast on the Lippe of a Lyon Iust, iust: and the men doe sympathize with the Mastiffes, in robustious and rough comming on, leauing their Wits with their Wiues: and then giue them great Meales of Beefe, and Iron and Steele; they will eate like Wolues, and fight like Deuils I, but these English are shrowdly out of Beefe Then shall we finde to morrow, they haue only stomackes to eate, and none to fight. Now is it time to arme: come, shall we about it? It is now two a Clock: but let me see, by ten Wee shall haue each a hundred English men. Now entertaine coniecture of a time, When creeping Murmure and the poring Darke Fills the wide Vessell of the Vniuerse. From Camp to Camp, through the foule Womb of Night The Humme of eyther Army stilly sounds; That the fixt Centinels almost receiue The secret Whispers of each others Watch. Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames Each Battaile sees the others vmber'd face. Steed threatens Steed, in high and boastfull Neighs Piercing the Nights dull Eare: and from the Tents, The Armourers accomplishing the Knights, With busie Hammers closing Riuets vp, Giue dreadfull note of preparation. The Countrey Cocks doe crow, the Clocks doe towle: And the third howre of drowsie Morning nam'd, Prowd of their Numbers, and secure in Soule, The confident and ouer-lustie French, Doe the low-rated English play at Dice; And chide the creeple-tardy-gated Night, Who like a foule and ougly Witch doth limpe So tediously away. The poore condemned English, Like Sacrifices, by their watchfull Fires Sit patiently, and inly ruminate The Mornings danger: and their gesture sad, Inuesting lanke-leane Cheekes, and Warre-worne Coats, Presented them vnto the gazing Moone So many horride Ghosts. O now, who will behold The Royall Captaine of this ruin'd Band Walking from Watch to Watch, from Tent to Tent; Let him cry, Prayse and Glory on his head: For forth he goes, and visits all his Hoast, Bids them good morrow with a modest Smyle, And calls them Brothers, Friends, and Countreymen. Vpon his Royall Face there is no note, How dread an Army hath enrounded him; Nor doth he dedicate one iot of Colour Vnto the wearie and all-watched Night: But freshly lookes, and ouer-beares Attaint, With chearefull semblance, and sweet Maiestie: That euery Wretch, pining and pale before, Beholding him, plucks comfort from his Lookes. A Largesse vniuersall, like the Sunne, His liberall Eye doth giue to euery one, Thawing cold feare, that meane and gentle all Behold, as may vnworthinesse define. A little touch of Harry in the Night, And so our Scene must to the Battaile flye: Where, O for pitty, we shall much disgrace, With foure or fiue most vile and ragged foyles, (Right ill dispos'd, in brawle ridiculous) The Name of Agincourt: Yet sit and see, Minding true things, by what their Mock'ries bee. Gloster, 'tis true that we are in great danger, The greater therefore should our Courage be. God morrow Brother Bedford: God Almightie, There is some soule of goodnesse in things euill, Would men obseruingly distill it out. For our bad Neighbour makes vs early stirrers, Which is both healthfull, and good husbandry. Besides, they are our outward Consciences, And Preachers to vs all; admonishing, That we should dresse vs fairely for our end. Thus may we gather Honey from the Weed, And make a Morall of the Diuell himselfe. Good morrow old Sir Thomas Erpingham: A good soft Pillow for that good white Head, Were better then a churlish turfe of France Not so my Liege, this Lodging likes me better, Since I may say, now lye I like a King 'Tis good for men to loue their present paines, Vpon example, so the Spirit is eased: And when the Mind is quickned, out of doubt The Organs, though defunct and dead before, Breake vp their drowsie Graue, and newly moue With casted slough, and fresh legeritie. Lend me thy Cloake Sir Thomas: Brothers both, Commend me to the Princes in our Campe; Doe my good morrow to them, and anon Desire them all to my Pauillion We shall, my Liege Shall I attend your Grace? No, my good Knight: Goe with my Brothers to my Lords of England: I and my Bosome must debate a while, And then I would no other company The Lord in Heauen blesse thee, Noble God a mercy old Heart, thou speak'st chearefully. Che vous la? A friend Discusse vnto me, art thou Officer, or art thou base, common, and popular? I am a Gentleman of a Company Trayl'st thou the puissant Pyke? Euen so: what are you? As good a Gentleman as the Emperor Then you are a better then the King The King's a Bawcock, and a Heart of Gold, a Lad of Life, an Impe of Fame, of Parents good, of Fist most valiant: I kisse his durtie shooe, and from heartstring I loue the louely Bully. What is thy Name? Harry le Roy Le Roy? a Cornish Name: art thou of Cornish Crew? No, I am a Welchman Know'st thou Fluellen? Yes Tell him Ile knock his Leeke about his Pate vpon Dauies day Doe not you weare your Dagger in your Cappe that day, least he knock that about yours Art thou his friend? And his Kinsman too The Figo for thee then I thanke you: God be with you My name is Pistol call'd. It sorts well with your fiercenesse. Manet King. Captaine Fluellen 'So, in the Name of Iesu Christ, speake fewer: it is the greatest admiration in the vniuersall World, when the true and aunchient Prerogatifes and Lawes of the Warres is not kept: if you would take the paines but to examine the Warres of Pompey the Great, you shall finde, I warrant you, that there is no tiddle tadle nor pibble bable in Pompeyes Campe: I warrant you, you shall finde the Ceremonies of the Warres, and the Cares of it, and the Formes of it, and the Sobrietie of it, and the Modestie of it, to be otherwise Why the Enemie is lowd, you heare him all Night If the Enemie is an Asse and a Foole, and a prating Coxcombe; is it meet, thinke you, that wee should also, looke you, be an Asse and a Foole, and a prating Coxcombe, in your owne conscience now? Gow. I will speake lower I pray you, and beseech you, that you will. Though it appeare a little out of fashion, There is much care and valour in this Welchman. Brother Iohn Bates, is not that the Morning which breakes yonder? I thinke it be: but wee haue no great cause to desire the approach of day Wee see yonder the beginning of the day, but I thinke wee shall neuer see the end of it. Who goes there? A Friend Vnder what Captaine serue you? Vnder Sir Iohn Erpingham A good old Commander, and a most kinde Gentleman: I pray you, what thinkes he of our estate? Euen as men wrackt vpon a Sand, that looke to be washt off the next Tyde He hath not told his thought to the King? King. No: nor it is not meet he should: for though I speake it to you, I thinke the King is but a man, as I am: the Violet smells to him, as it doth to me; the Element shewes to him, as it doth to me; all his Sences haue but humane Conditions: his Ceremonies layd by, in his Nakednesse he appeares but a man; and though his affections are higher mounted then ours, yet when they stoupe, they stoupe with the like wing: therefore, when he sees reason of feares, as we doe; his feares, out of doubt, be of the same rellish as ours are: yet in reason, no man should possesse him with any appearance of feare; least hee, by shewing it, should dis-hearten his Army He may shew what outward courage he will: but I beleeue, as cold a Night as 'tis, hee could wish himselfe in Thames vp to the Neck; and so I would he were, and I by him, at all aduentures, so we were quit here By my troth, I will speake my conscience of the King: I thinke hee would not wish himselfe any where, but where hee is Then I would he were here alone; so should he be sure to be ransomed, and a many poore mens liues saued I dare say, you loue him not so ill, to wish him here alone: howsoeuer you speake this to feele other mens minds, me thinks I could not dye any where so contented, as in the Kings company; his Cause being iust, and his Quarrell honorable That's more then we know I, or more then wee should seeke after; for wee know enough, if wee know wee are the Kings Subiects: if his Cause be wrong, our obedience to the King wipes the Cryme of it out of vs But if the Cause be not good, the King himselfe hath a heauie Reckoning to make, when all those Legges, and Armes, and Heads, chopt off in a Battaile, shall ioyne together at the latter day, and cry all, Wee dyed at such a place, some swearing, some crying for a Surgean; some vpon their Wiues, left poore behind them; some vpon the Debts they owe, some vpon their Children rawly left: I am afear'd, there are few dye well, that dye in a Battaile: for how can they charitably dispose of any thing, when Blood is their argument? Now, if these men doe not dye well, it will be a black matter for the King, that led them to it; who to disobey, were against all proportion of subiection So, if a Sonne that is by his Father sent about Merchandize, doe sinfully miscarry vpon the Sea; the imputation of his wickednesse, by your rule, should be imposed vpon his Father that sent him: or if a Seruant, vnder his Masters command, transporting a summe of Money, be assayled by Robbers, and dye in many irreconcil'd Iniquities; you may call the businesse of the Master the author of the Seruants damnation: but this is not so: The King is not bound to answer the particular endings of his Souldiers, the Father of his Sonne, nor the Master of his Seruant; for they purpose not their death, when they purpose their seruices. Besides, there is no King, be his Cause neuer so spotlesse, if it come to the arbitrement of Swords, can trye it out with all vnspotted Souldiers: some (peraduenture) haue on them the guilt of premeditated and contriued Murther; some, of beguiling Virgins with the broken Seales of Periurie; some, making the Warres their Bulwarke, that haue before gored the gentle Bosome of Peace with Pillage and Robberie. Now, if these men haue defeated the Law, and outrunne Natiue punishment; though they can out-strip men, they haue no wings to flye from God. Warre is his Beadle, Warre is his Vengeance: so that here men are punisht, for before breach of the Kings Lawes, in now the Kings Quarrell: where they feared the death, they haue borne life away; and where they would bee safe, they perish. Then if they dye vnprouided, no more is the King guiltie of their damnation, then hee was before guiltie of those Impieties, for the which they are now visited. Euery Subiects Dutie is the Kings, but euery Subiects Soule is his owne. Therefore should euery Souldier in the Warres doe as euery sicke man in his Bed, wash euery Moth out of his Conscience: and dying so, Death is to him aduantage; or not dying, the time was blessedly lost, wherein such preparation was gayned: and in him that escapes, it were not sinne to thinke, that making God so free an offer, he let him outliue that day, to see his Greatnesse, and to teach others how they should prepare 'Tis certaine, euery man that dyes ill, the ill vpon his owne head, the King is not to answer it I doe not desire hee should answer for me, and yet I determine to fight lustily for him I my selfe heard the King say he would not be ransom'd I, hee said so, to make vs fight chearefully: but when our throats are cut, hee may be ransom'd, and wee ne're the wiser If I liue to see it, I will neuer trust his word after You pay him then: that's a perillous shot out of an Elder Gunne, that a poore and a priuate displeasure can doe against a Monarch: you may as well goe about to turne the Sunne to yce, with fanning in his face with a Peacocks feather: You'le neuer trust his word after; come, 'tis a foolish saying Your reproofe is something too round, I should be angry with you, if the time were conuenient Let it bee a Quarrell betweene vs, if you liue I embrace it How shall I know thee againe? Giue me any Gage of thine, and I will weare it in my Bonnet: Then if euer thou dar'st acknowledge it, I will make it my Quarrell Heere's my Gloue: Giue mee another of thine There This will I also weare in my Cap: if euer thou come to me, and say, after to morrow, This is my Gloue, by this Hand I will take thee a box on the eare If euer I liue to see it, I will challenge it Thou dar'st as well be hang'd Well, I will doe it, though I take thee in the Kings companie Keepe thy word: fare thee well Be friends you English fooles, be friends, wee haue French Quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon. Indeede the French may lay twentie French Crownes to one, they will beat vs, for they beare them on their shoulders: but it is no English Treason to cut French Crownes, and to morrow the King himselfe will be a Clipper. Vpon the King, let vs our Liues, our Soules, Our Debts, our carefull Wiues, Our Children, and our Sinnes, lay on the King: We must beare all. O hard Condition, Twin-borne with Greatnesse, Subiect to the breath of euery foole, whose sence No more can feele, but his owne wringing. What infinite hearts-ease must Kings neglect, That priuate men enioy? And what haue Kings, that Priuates haue not too, Saue Ceremonie, saue generall Ceremonie? And what art thou, thou Idoll Ceremonie? What kind of God art thou? that suffer'st more Of mortall griefes, then doe thy worshippers. What are thy Rents? what are thy Commings in? O Ceremonie, shew me but thy worth. What? is thy Soule of Odoration? Art thou ought else but Place, Degree, and Forme, Creating awe and feare in other men? Wherein thou art lesse happy, being fear'd, Then they in fearing. What drink'st thou oft, in stead of Homage sweet, But poyson'd flatterie? O, be sick, great Greatnesse, And bid thy Ceremonie giue thee cure. Thinks thou the fierie Feuer will goe out With Titles blowne from Adulation? Will it giue place to flexure and low bending? Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggers knee, Command the health of it? No, thou prowd Dreame, That play'st so subtilly with a Kings Repose. I am a King that find thee: and I know, 'Tis not the Balme, the Scepter, and the Ball, The Sword, the Mase, the Crowne Imperiall, The enter-tissued Robe of Gold and Pearle, The farsed Title running 'fore the King, The Throne he sits on: nor the Tyde of Pompe, That beates vpon the high shore of this World: No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous Ceremonie; Not all these, lay'd in Bed Maiesticall, Can sleepe so soundly, as the wretched Slaue: Who with a body fill'd, and vacant mind, Gets him to rest, cram'd with distressefull bread, Neuer sees horride Night, the Child of Hell: But like a Lacquey, from the Rise to Set, Sweates in the eye of Phebus; and all Night Sleepes in Elizium: next day after dawne, Doth rise and helpe Hiperio to his Horse, And followes so the euer-running yeere With profitable labour to his Graue: And but for Ceremonie, such a Wretch, Winding vp Dayes with toyle, and Nights with sleepe, Had the fore-hand and vantage of a King. The Slaue, a Member of the Countreyes peace, Enioyes it; but in grosse braine little wots, What watch the King keepes, to maintaine the peace; Whose howres, the Pesant best aduantages. My Lord, your Nobles iealous of your absence, Seeke through your Campe to find you Good old Knight, collect them all together At my Tent: Ile be before thee I shall doo't, my Lord. O God of Battailes, steele my Souldiers hearts, Possesse them not with feare: Take from them now The sence of reckning of th' opposed numbers: Pluck their hearts from them. Not to day, O Lord, O not to day, thinke not vpon the fault My Father made, in compassing the Crowne. I Richards body haue interred new, And on it haue bestowed more contrite teares, Then from it issued forced drops of blood. Fiue hundred poore I haue in yeerely pay, Who twice a day their wither'd hands hold vp Toward Heauen, to pardon blood: And I haue built two Chauntries, Where the sad and solemne Priests sing still For Richards Soule. More will I doe: Though all that I can doe, is nothing worth; Since that my Penitence comes after all, Imploring pardon. My Liege My Brother Gloucesters voyce? I: I know thy errand, I will goe with thee: The day, my friend, and all things stay for me. The Sunne doth gild our Armour vp, my Lords Monte Cheual: My Horse, Verlot Lacquay: Ha Oh braue Spirit Via les ewes & terre Rien puis le air & feu Cein, Cousin Orleance. Now my Lord Constable? Const. Hearke how our Steedes, for present Seruice neigh Mount them, and make incision in their Hides, That their hot blood may spin in English eyes, And doubt them with superfluous courage: ha What, wil you haue them weep our Horses blood? How shall we then behold their naturall teares? The English are embattail'd, you French Peeres To Horse you gallant Princes, straight to Horse. Doe but behold yond poore and starued Band, And your faire shew shall suck away their Soules, Leauing them but the shales and huskes of men. There is not worke enough for all our hands, Scarce blood enough in all their sickly Veines, To giue each naked Curtleax a stayne, That our French Gallants shall to day draw out, And sheath for lack of sport. Let vs but blow on them, The vapour of our Valour will o're-turne them. 'Tis positiue against all exceptions, Lords, That our superfluous Lacquies, and our Pesants, Who in vnnecessarie action swarme About our Squares of Battaile, were enow To purge this field of such a hilding Foe; Though we vpon this Mountaines Basis by, Tooke stand for idle speculation: But that our Honours must not. What's to say? A very little little let vs doe, And all is done: then let the Trumpets sound The Tucket Sonuance, and the Note to mount: For our approach shall so much dare the field, That England shall couch downe in feare, and yeeld. Why do you stay so long, my Lords of France? Yond Iland Carrions, desperate of their bones, Ill-fauoredly become the Morning field: Their ragged Curtaines poorely are let loose, And our Ayre shakes them passing scornefully. Bigge Mars seemes banqu'rout in their begger'd Hoast, And faintly through a rustie Beuer peepes. The Horsemen sit like fixed Candlesticks, With Torch-staues in their hand: and their poore Iades Lob downe their heads, dropping the hides and hips: The gumme downe roping from their pale-dead eyes, And in their pale dull mouthes the Iymold Bitt Lyes foule with chaw'd-grasse, still and motionlesse. And their executors, the knauish Crowes, Flye o're them all, impatient for their howre. Description cannot sute it selfe in words, To demonstrate the Life of such a Battaile, In life so liuelesse, as it shewes it selfe They haue said their prayers, And they stay for death Shall we goe send them Dinners, and fresh Sutes, And giue their fasting Horses Prouender, And after fight with them? I stay but for my Guard: on To the field, I will the Banner from a Trumpet take, And vse it for my haste. Come, come away, The Sunne is high, and we out-weare the day. Salisbury, and Westmerland. Where is the King? The King himselfe is rode to view their Battaile Of fighting men they haue full threescore thousand There's fiue to one, besides they all are fresh Gods Arme strike with vs, 'tis a fearefull oddes. God buy' you Princes all; Ile to my Charge: If we no more meet, till we meet in Heauen; Then ioyfully, my Noble Lord of Bedford, My deare Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter, And my kind Kinsman, Warriors all, adieu Farwell good Salisbury, & good luck go with thee: And yet I doe thee wrong, to mind thee of it, For thou art fram'd of the firme truth of valour Farwell kind Lord: fight valiantly to day He is as full of Valour as of Kindnesse, Princely in both. O that we now had here But one ten thousand of those men in England, That doe no worke to day What's he that wishes so? My Cousin Westmerland. No, my faire Cousin: If we are markt to dye, we are enow To doe our Countrey losse: and if to liue, The fewer men, the greater share of honour. Gods will, I pray thee wish not one man more. By Ioue, I am not couetous for Gold, Nor care I who doth feed vpon my cost: It yernes me not, if men my Garments weare; Such outward things dwell not in my desires. But if it be a sinne to couet Honor, I am the most offending Soule aliue. No 'faith, my Couze, wish not a man from England: Gods peace, I would not loose so great an Honor, As one man more me thinkes would share from me, For the best hope I haue. O, doe not wish one more: Rather proclaime it (Westmerland) through my Hoast, That he which hath no stomack to this fight, Let him depart, his Pasport shall be made, And Crownes for Conuoy put into his Purse: We would not dye in that mans companie, That feares his fellowship, to dye with vs. This day is call'd the Feast of Crispian: He that out-liues this day, and comes safe home, Will stand a tip-toe when this day is named, And rowse him at the Name of Crispian. He that shall see this day, and liue old age, Will yeerely on the Vigil feast his neighbours, And say, to morrow is Saint Crispian. Then will he strip his sleeue, and shew his skarres: Old men forget; yet all shall be forgot: But hee'le remember, with aduantages, What feats he did that day. Then shall our Names, Familiar in his mouth as household words, Harry the King, Bedford and Exeter, Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester, Be in their flowing Cups freshly remembred. This story shall the good man teach his sonne: And Crispine Crispian shall ne're goe by, From this day to the ending of the World, But we in it shall be remembred; We few, we happy few, we band of brothers: For he to day that sheds his blood with me, Shall be my brother: be he ne're so vile, This day shall gentle his Condition. And Gentlemen in England, now a bed, Shall thinke themselues accurst they were not here; And hold their Manhoods cheape, whiles any speakes, That fought with vs vpon Saint Crispines day. My Soueraign Lord, bestow your selfe with speed: The French are brauely in their battailes set, And will with all expedience charge on vs All things are ready, if our minds be so Perish the man, whose mind is backward now Thou do'st not wish more helpe from England, Couze? Gods will, my Liege, would you and I alone, Without more helpe, could fight this Royall battaile Why now thou hast vnwisht fiue thousand men: Which likes me better, then to wish vs one. You know your places: God be with you all. Enter Montioy. Once more I come to know of thee King Harry, If for thy Ransome thou wilt now compound, Before thy most assured Ouerthrow: For certainly, thou art so neere the Gulfe, Thou needs must be englutted. Besides, in mercy The Constable desires thee, thou wilt mind Thy followers of Repentance; that their Soules May make a peacefull and a sweet retyre From off these fields: where (wretches) their poore bodies Must lye and fester Who hath sent thee now? The Constable of France I pray thee beare my former Answer back: Bid them atchieue me, and then sell my bones. Good God, why should they mock poore fellowes thus? The man that once did sell the Lyons skin While the beast liu'd, was kill'd with hunting him. A many of our bodyes shall no doubt Find Natiue Graues: vpon the which, I trust Shall witnesse liue in Brasse of this dayes worke. And those that leaue their valiant bones in France, Dying like men, though buryed in your Dunghills, They shall be fam'd: for there the Sun shall greet them, And draw their honors reeking vp to Heauen, Leauing their earthly parts to choake your Clyme, The smell whereof shall breed a Plague in France. Marke then abounding valour in our English: That being dead, like to the bullets crasing, Breake out into a second course of mischiefe, Killing in relapse of Mortalitie. Let me speake prowdly: Tell the Constable, We are but Warriors for the working day: Our Gaynesse and our Gilt are all besmyrcht With raynie Marching in the painefull field. There's not a piece of feather in our Hoast: Good argument (I hope) we will not flye: And time hath worne vs into slouenrie. But by the Masse, our hearts are in the trim: And my poore Souldiers tell me, yet ere Night, They'le be in fresher Robes, or they will pluck The gay new Coats o're the French Souldiers heads, And turne them out of seruice. If they doe this, As if God please, they shall; my Ransome then Will soone be leuyed. Herauld, saue thou thy labour: Come thou no more for Ransome, gentle Herauld, They shall haue none, I sweare, but these my ioynts: Which if they haue, as I will leaue vm them, Shall yeeld them little, tell the Constable I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well: Thou neuer shalt heare Herauld any more. I feare thou wilt once more come againe for a My Lord, most humbly on my knee I begge The leading of the Vaward Take it, braue Yorke. Now Souldiers march away, And how thou pleasest God, dispose the day. Yeeld Curre Ie pense que vous estes le Gentilhome de bon qualitee Qualtitie calmie custure me. Art thou a Gentleman? What is thy Name? discusse O Seigneur Dieu O Signieur Dewe should be a Gentleman: perpend my words O Signieur Dewe, and marke: O Signieur Dewe, thou dyest on point of Fox, except O Signieur thou doe giue to me egregious Ransome O prennes miserecordie aye pitez de moy Moy shall not serue, I will haue fortie Moyes: for I will fetch thy rymme out at thy Throat, in droppes of Crimson blood Est il impossible d' eschapper le force de ton bras Brasse, Curre? thou damned and luxurious Mountaine Goat, offer'st me Brasse?

Follow mee Saaue vous le grand Capitaine? I did neuer know so full a voyce issue from so emptie a heart: but the saying is true, The empty vessel makes the greatest sound, Bardolfe and Nym had tenne times more valour, then this roaring diuell i'th olde play, that euerie one may payre his nayles with a woodden dagger, and they are both hang'd, and so would this be, if hee durst steale any thing aduenturously. I must stay with the Lackies with the luggage of our camp, the French might haue a good pray of vs, if he knew of it, for there is none to guard it but boyes. O Diable O signeur le iour et perdia, toute et perdie Mor Dieu ma vie, all is confounded all, Reproach, and euerlasting shame Sits mocking in our Plumes. A short Alarum. O meschante Fortune, do not runne away Why all our rankes are broke O perdurable shame, let's stab our selues: Be these the wretches that we plaid at dice for? Is this the King we sent too, for his ransome? Shame, and eternall shame, nothing but shame, Let vs dye in once more backe againe, And he that will not follow Burbon now, Let him go hence, and with his cap in hand Like a base Pander hold the Chamber doore, Whilst a base slaue, no gentler then my dogge, His fairest daughter is contaminated Disorder that hath spoyl'd vs, friend vs now, Let vs on heapes go offer vp our liues We are enow yet liuing in the Field, To smother vp the English in our throngs, If any order might be thought vpon The diuell take Order now, Ile to the throng; Let life be short, else shame will be too long. Well haue we done, thrice-valiant Countrimen, But all's not done, yet keepe the French the field The D. of York commends him to your Maiesty Liues he good Vnckle: thrice within this houre I saw him downe; thrice vp againe, and fighting, From Helmet to the spurre, all blood he was In which array (braue Soldier) doth he lye, Larding the plaine: and by his bloody side, (Yoake-fellow to his honour-owing-wounds) The Noble Earle of Suffolke also lyes. Suffolke first dyed, and Yorke all hagled ouer Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteeped, And takes him by the Beard, kisses the gashes That bloodily did yawne vpon his face. He cryes aloud; Tarry my Cosin Suffolke, My soule shall thine keepe company to heauen: Tarry (sweet soule) for mine, then flye a-brest: As in this glorious and well-foughten field We kept together in our Chiualrie. Vpon these words I came, and cheer'd him vp, He smil'd me in the face, raught me his hand, And with a feeble gripe, sayes: Deere my Lord, Commend my seruice to my Soueraigne, So did he turne, and ouer Suffolkes necke He threw his wounded arme, and kist his lippes, And so espous'd to death, with blood he seal'd A Testament of Noble-ending-loue: The prettie and sweet manner of it forc'd Those waters from me, which I would haue stop'd, But I had not so much of man in mee, And all my mother came into mine eyes, And gaue me vp to teares I blame you not, For hearing this, I must perforce compound With mixtfull eyes, or they will issue to. But hearke, what new alarum is this same? The French haue re-enforc'd their scatter'd men: Then euery souldiour kill his Prisoners, Giue the word through. Kill the poyes and the luggage, 'Tis expressely against the Law of Armes, tis as arrant a peece of knauery marke you now, as can bee offert in your Conscience now, is it not? Gow. Tis certaine, there's not a boy left aliue, and the Cowardly Rascalls that ranne from the battaile ha' done this slaughter: besides they haue burned and carried away all that was in the Kings Tent, wherefore the King most worthily hath caus'd euery soldiour to cut his prisoners throat. O 'tis a gallant King I, hee was porne at Monmouth Captaine Gower: What call you the Townes name where Alexander the pig was borne? Alexander the Great Why I pray you, is not pig, great? The pig, or the great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the magnanimous, are all one reckonings, saue the phrase is a litle variations I thinke Alexander the Great was borne in Macedon, his Father was called Phillip of Macedon, as I take it I thinke it is in Macedon where Alexander is porne: I tell you Captaine, if you looke in the Maps of the Orld, I warrant you sall finde in the comparisons betweene Macedon & Monmouth, that the situations looke you, is both alike. There is a Riuer in Macedon, & there is also moreouer a Riuer at Monmouth, it is call'd Wye at Monmouth: but it is out of my praines, what is the name of the other Riuer: but 'tis all one, tis alike as my fingers is to my fingers, and there is Salmons in both. If you marke Alexanders life well, Harry of Monmouthes life is come after it indifferent well, for there is figures in all things. Alexander God knowes, and you know, in his rages, and his furies, and his wraths, and his chollers, and his moodes, and his displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a little intoxicates in his praines, did in his Ales and his angers (looke you) kill his best friend Clytus Our King is not like him in that, he neuer kill'd any of his friends It is not well done (marke you now) to take the tales out of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak but in the figures, and comparisons of it: as Alexander kild his friend Clytus, being in his Ales and his Cuppes; so also Harry Monmouth being in his right wittes, and his good iudgements, turn'd away the fat Knight with the great belly doublet: he was full of iests, and gypes, and knaueries, and mockes, I haue forgot his name Sir Iohn Falstaffe That is he: Ile tell you, there is good men porne at Monmouth Heere comes his Maiesty. I was not angry since I came to France, Vntill this instant. Take a Trumpet Herald, Ride thou vnto the Horsemen on yond hill: If they will fight with vs, bid them come downe, Or voyde the field: they do offend our sight. If they'l do neither, we will come to them, And make them sker away, as swift as stones Enforced from the old Assyrian slings: Besides, wee'l cut the throats of those we haue, And not a man of them that we shall take, Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so. Here comes the Herald of the French, my Liege His eyes are humbler then they vs'd to be How now, what meanes this Herald? Knowst thou not, That I haue fin'd these bones of mine for ransome? Com'st thou againe for ransome? No great King: I come to thee for charitable License, That we may wander ore this bloody field, To booke our dead, and then to bury them, To sort our Nobles from our common men. For many of our Princes (woe the while) Lye drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood: So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbes In blood of Princes, and with wounded steeds Fret fet-locke deepe in gore, and with wilde rage Yerke out their armed heeles at their dead masters, Killing them twice. O giue vs leaue great King, To view the field in safety, and dispose Of their dead bodies I tell thee truly Herald, I know not if the day be ours or no, For yet a many of your horsemen peere, And gallop ore the field The day is yours Praised be God, and not our strength for it: What is this Castle call'd that stands hard by They call it Agincourt Then call we this the field of Agincourt, Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus Your Grandfather of famous memory (an't please your Maiesty) and your great Vncle Edward the Placke Prince of Wales, as I haue read in the Chronicles, fought a most praue pattle here in France They did Fluellen Your Maiesty sayes very true: If your Maiesties is remembred of it, the Welchmen did good seruice in a Garden where Leekes did grow, wearing Leekes in their Monmouth caps, which your Maiesty know to this houre is an honourable badge of the seruice: And I do beleeue your Maiesty takes no scorne to weare the Leeke vppon S. Tauies day I weare it for a memorable honor: For I am Welch you know good Countriman All the water in Wye, cannot wash your Maiesties Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell you that: God plesse it, and preserue it, as long as it pleases his Grace, and his Maiesty too Thankes good my Countrymen By Ieshu, I am your Maiesties Countreyman, I care not who know it: I will confesse it to all the Orld, I need not to be ashamed of your Maiesty, praised be God so long as your Maiesty is an honest man Good keepe me so. Our Heralds go with him, Bring me iust notice of the numbers dead On both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither Souldier, you must come to the King Souldier, why wear'st thou that Gloue in thy Cappe? And't please your Maiesty, tis the gage of one that I should fight withall, if he be aliue An Englishman? Wil. And't please your Maiesty, a Rascall that swagger'd with me last night: who if aliue, and euer dare to challenge this Gloue, I haue sworne to take him a boxe a'th ere: or if I can see my Gloue in his cappe, which he swore as he was a Souldier he would weare (if aliue) I wil strike it out soundly What thinke you Captaine Fluellen, is it fit this souldier keepe his oath Hee is a Crauen and a Villaine else, and't please your Maiesty in my conscience It may bee, his enemy is a Gentleman of great sort quite from the answer of his degree Though he be as good a Ientleman as the diuel is, as Lucifer and Belzebub himselfe, it is necessary (looke your Grace) that he keepe his vow and his oath: If hee bee periur'd (see you now) his reputation is as arrant a villaine and a Iacke sawce, as euer his blacke shoo trodd vpon Gods ground, and his earth, in my conscience law King. Then keepe thy vow sirrah, when thou meet'st the fellow So, I wil my Liege, as I liue Who seru'st thou vnder? Vnder Captaine Gower, my Liege Gower is a good Captaine, and is good knowledge and literatured in the Warres Call him hither to me, Souldier I will my Liege. Here Fluellen, weare thou this fauour for me, and sticke it in thy Cappe: when Alanson and my selfe were downe together, I pluckt this Gloue from his Helme: If any man challenge this, hee is a friend to Alanson, and an enemy to our Person; if thou encounter any such, apprehend him, and thou do'st me loue Your Grace doo's me as great Honors as can be desir'd in the hearts of his Subiects: I would faine see the man, that ha's but two legges, that shall find himselfe agreefd at this Gloue; that is all: but I would faine see it once, and please God of his grace that I might see Know'st thou Gower? He is my deare friend, and please you Pray thee goe seeke him, and bring him to my Tent I will fetch him. My Lord of Warwick, and my Brother Gloster, Follow Fluellen closely at the heeles. The Gloue which I haue giuen him for a fauour, May haply purchase him a box a'th' eare. It is the Souldiers: I by bargaine should Weare it my selfe. Follow good Cousin Warwick: If that the Souldier strike him, as I iudge By his blunt bearing, he will keepe his word; Some sodaine mischiefe may arise of it: For I doe know Fluellen valiant, And toucht with Choler, hot as Gunpowder, And quickly will returne an iniurie. Follow, and see there be no harme betweene them. Goe you with me, Vnckle of Exeter. I warrant it is to Knight you, Captaine. Gods will, and his pleasure, Captaine, I beseech you now, come apace to the King: there is more good toward you peraduenture, then is in your knowledge to dreame of Sir, know you this Gloue?

Now Herauld, are the dead numbred? Heere is the number of the slaught'red French What Prisoners of good sort are taken, Vnckle? Charles Duke of Orleance, Nephew to the King, Iohn Duke of Burbon, and Lord Bouchiquald: Of other Lords and Barons, Knights and Squires, Full fifteene hundred, besides common men This Note doth tell me of ten thousand French That in the field lye slaine: of Princes in this number, And Nobles bearing Banners, there lye dead One hundred twentie six: added to these, Of Knights, Esquires, and gallant Gentlemen, Eight thousand and foure hundred: of the which, Fiue hundred were but yesterday dubb'd Knights. So that in these ten thousand they haue lost, There are but sixteene hundred Mercenaries: The rest are Princes, Barons, Lords, Knights, Squires, And Gentlemen of bloud and qualitie. The Names of those their Nobles that lye dead: Charles Delabreth, High Constable of France, Iaques of Chatilion, Admirall of France, The Master of the Crosse-bowes, Lord Rambures, Great Master of France, the braue Sir Guichard Dolphin, Iohn Duke of Alanson, Anthonie Duke of Brabant, The Brother to the Duke of Burgundie, And Edward Duke of Barr: of lustie Earles, Grandpree and Roussie, Fauconbridge and Foyes, Beaumont and Marle, Vandemont and Lestrale. Here was a Royall fellowship of death. Where is the number of our English dead? Edward the Duke of Yorke, the Earle of Suffolke, Sir Richard Ketly, Dauy Gam Esquire; None else of name: and of all other men, But fiue and twentie. O God, thy Arme was heere: And not to vs, but to thy Arme alone, Ascribe we all: when, without stratagem, But in plaine shock, and euen play of Battaile, Was euer knowne so great and little losse? On one part and on th' other, take it God, For it is none but thine 'Tis wonderfull Come, goe we in procession to the Village: And be it death proclaymed through our Hoast, To boast of this, or take that prayse from God, Which is his onely Is it not lawfull and please your Maiestie, to tell how many is kill'd? Yes Captaine: but with this acknowledgement, That God fought for vs Yes, my conscience, he did vs great good Doe we all holy Rights: Let there be sung Non nobis, and Te Deum, The dead with charitie enclos'd in Clay: And then to Callice, and to England then, Where ne're from France arriu'd more happy men. Vouchsafe to those that haue not read the Story, That I may prompt them: and of such as haue, I humbly pray them to admit th' excuse Of time, of numbers, and due course of things, Which cannot in their huge and proper life, Be here presented. Now we beare the King Toward Callice: Graunt him there; there seene, Heaue him away vpon your winged thoughts, Athwart the Sea: Behold the English beach Pales in the flood; with Men, Wiues, and Boyes, Whose shouts & claps out-voyce the deep-mouth'd Sea, Which like a mightie Whiffler 'fore the King, Seemes to prepare his way: So let him land, And solemnly see him set on to London. So swift a pace hath Thought, that euen now You may imagine him vpon Black-Heath: Where, that his Lords desire him, to haue borne His bruised Helmet, and his bended Sword Before him, through the Citie: he forbids it, Being free from vainnesse, and selfe-glorious pride; Giuing full Trophee, Signall, and Ostent, Quite from himselfe, to God. But now behold, In the quick Forge and working-house of Thought, How London doth powre out her Citizens, The Maior and all his Brethren in best sort, Like to the Senatours of th' antique Rome, With the Plebeians swarming at their heeles, Goe forth and fetch their Conqu'ring Cæsar in: As by a lower, but by louing likelyhood, Were now the Generall of our gracious Empresse, As in good time he may, from Ireland comming, Bringing Rebellion broached on his Sword; How many would the peacefull Citie quit, To welcome him? much more, and much more cause, Did they this Harry. Now in London place him. As yet the lamentation of the French Inuites the King of Englands stay at home: The Emperour's comming in behalfe of France, To order peace betweene them: and omit All the occurrences, what euer chanc't, Till Harryes backe returne againe to France: There must we bring him; and my selfe haue play'd The interim, by remembring you 'tis past. Then brooke abridgement, and your eyes aduance, After your thoughts, straight backe againe to France. Nay, that's right: but why weare you your Leeke to day? S. Dauies day is past There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in all things: I will tell you asse my friend, Captaine Gower; the rascally, scauld, beggerly, lowsie, pragging Knaue Pistoll, which you and your selfe, and all the World, know to be no petter then a fellow, looke you now, of no merits: hee is come to me, and prings me pread and sault yesterday, looke you, and bid me eate my Leeke: it was in a place where I could not breed no contention with him; but I will be so bold as to weare it in my Cap till I see him once againe, and then I will tell him a little piece of my desires. Enter Pistoll. Why heere hee comes, swelling like a Turkycock 'Tis no matter for his swellings, nor his Turkycocks. God plesse you aunchient Pistoll: you scuruie lowsie Knaue, God plesse you Ha, art thou bedlam? doest thou thirst, base Troian, to haue me fold vp Parcas fatall Web? Hence; I am qualmish at the smell of Leeke I peseech you heartily, scuruie lowsie Knaue, at my desires, and my requests, and my petitions, to eate, looke you, this Leeke; because, looke you, you doe not loue it, nor your affections, and your appetites and your disgestions doo's not agree with it, I would desire you to eate it Not for Cadwallader and all his Goats There is one Goat for you. Strikes him. Will you be so good, scauld Knaue, as eate it? Base Troian, thou shalt dye You say very true, scauld Knaue, when Gods will is: I will desire you to liue in the meane time, and eate your Victuals: come, there is sawce for it. You call'd me yesterday Mountaine-Squier, but I will make you to day a squire of low degree. I pray you fall too, if you can mocke a Leeke, you can eate a Leeke Enough Captaine, you haue astonisht him I say, I will make him eate some part of my leeke, or I will peate his pate foure dayes: bite I pray you, it is good for your greene wound, and your ploodie Coxecombe Must I bite Yes certainly, and out of doubt and out of question too, and ambiguities By this Leeke, I will most horribly reuenge I eate and eate I sweare Eate I pray you, will you haue some more sauce to your Leeke: there is not enough Leeke to sweare by Quiet thy Cudgell, thou dost see I eate Much good do you scald knaue, heartily. Nay, pray you throw none away, the skinne is good for your broken Coxcombe; when you take occasions to see Leekes heereafter, I pray you mocke at 'em, that is all Good I, Leekes is good: hold you, there is a groat to heale your pate Me a groat? Yes verily, and in truth you shall take it, or I haue another Leeke in my pocket, which you shall eate I take thy groat in earnest of reuenge If I owe you any thing, I will pay you in Cudgels, you shall be a Woodmonger, and buy nothing of me but cudgels: God bu'y you, and keepe you, & heale your pate. All hell shall stirre for this Go, go, you are a counterfeit cowardly Knaue, will you mocke at an ancient Tradition began vppon an honourable respect, and worne as a memorable Trophee of predeceased valor, and dare not auouch in your deeds any of your words. I haue seene you gleeking & galling at this Gentleman twice or thrice. You thought, because he could not speake English in the natiue garb, he could not therefore handle an English Cudgell: you finde it otherwise, and henceforth let a Welsh correction, teach you a good English condition, fare ye well. Doeth fortune play the huswife with me now? Newes haue I that my Doll is dead i'th Spittle of a malady of France, and there my rendeuous is quite cut off: Old I do waxe, and from my wearie limbes honour is Well, Baud Ile turne, and something leane to Cut-purse of quicke hand: To England will I steale, and there Ile steale: And patches will I get vnto these cudgeld scarres, And swore I got them in the Gallia warres. other At another, Queene Isabel, the King, the Duke of Bourgougne, and other French. Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met; Vnto our brother France, and to our Sister Health and faire time of day: Ioy and good wishes To our most faire and Princely Cosine Katherine: And as a branch and member of this Royalty, By whom this great assembly is contriu'd, We do salute you Duke of Burgogne, And Princes French and Peeres health to you all Right ioyous are we to behold your face, Most worthy brother England, fairely met, So are you Princes (English) euery one So happy be the Issue brother Ireland Of this good day, and of this gracious meeting, As we are now glad to behold your eyes, Your eyes which hitherto haue borne In them against the French that met them in their bent, The fatall Balls of murthering Basiliskes: The venome of such Lookes we fairely hope Haue lost their qualitie, and that this day Shall change all griefes and quarrels into loue To cry Amen to that, thus we appeare You English Princes all, I doe salute you My dutie to you both, on equall loue. Great Kings of France and England: that I haue labour'd With all my wits, my paines, and strong endeuors, To bring your most Imperiall Maiesties Vnto this Barre, and Royall enterview; Your Mightinesse on both parts best can witnesse. Since then my Office hath so farre preuayl'd, That Face to Face, and Royall Eye to Eye, You haue congreeted: let it not disgrace me, If I demand before this Royall view, What Rub, or what Impediment there is, Why that the naked, poore, and mangled Peace, Deare Nourse of Arts, Plentyes, and ioyfull Births, Should not in this best Garden of the World, Our fertile France, put vp her louely Visage? Alas, shee hath from France too long been chas'd, And all her Husbandry doth lye on heapes, Corrupting in it owne fertilitie. Her Vine, the merry chearer of the heart, Vnpruned, dyes: her Hedges euen pleach'd, Like Prisoners wildly ouer-growne with hayre, Put forth disorder'd Twigs: her fallow Leas, The Darnell, Hemlock, and ranke Femetary, Doth root vpon; while that the Culter rusts, That should deracinate such Sauagery: The euen Meade, that erst brought sweetly forth The freckled Cowslip, Burnet, and greene Clouer, Wanting the Sythe, withall vncorrected, ranke; Conceiues by idlenesse, and nothing teemes, But hatefull Docks, rough Thistles, Keksyes, Burres, Loosing both beautie and vtilitie; And all our Vineyards, Fallowes, Meades, and Hedges, Defectiue in their natures, grow to wildnesse. Euen so our Houses, and our selues, and Children, Haue lost, or doe not learne, for want of time, The Sciences that should become our Countrey; But grow like Sauages, as Souldiers will, That nothing doe, but meditate on Blood, To Swearing, and sterne Lookes, defus'd Attyre, And euery thing that seemes vnnaturall. Which to reduce into our former fauour, You are assembled: and my speech entreats, That I may know the Let, why gentle Peace Should not expell these inconueniences, And blesse vs with her former qualities If Duke of Burgonie, you would the Peace, Whose want giues growth to th' imperfections Which you haue cited; you must buy that Peace With full accord to all our iust demands, Whose Tenures and particular effects You haue enschedul'd briefely in your hands The King hath heard them: to the which, as yet There is no Answer made Well then: the Peace which you before so vrg'd, Lyes in his Answer I haue but with a curselarie eye O're-glanc't the Articles: Pleaseth your Grace To appoint some of your Councell presently To sit with vs once more, with better heed To re-suruey them; we will suddenly Passe our accept and peremptorie Answer Brother we shall. Goe Vnckle Exeter, And Brother Clarence, and you Brother Gloucester, Warwick, and Huntington, goe with the King, And take with you free power, to ratifie, Augment, or alter, as your Wisdomes best Shall see aduantageable for our Dignitie, Any thing in or out of our Demands, And wee'le consigne thereto. Will you, faire Sister, Goe with the Princes, or stay here with vs? Our gracious Brother, I will goe with them: Happily a Womans Voyce may doe some good, When Articles too nicely vrg'd, be stood on Yet leaue our Cousin Katherine here with vs, She is our capitall Demand, compris'd She hath good leaue. Manet King and Katherine Faire Katherine, and most faire, Will you vouchsafe to teach a Souldier tearmes, Such as will enter at a Ladyes eare, And pleade his Loue-suit to her gentle heart Your Maiestie shall mock at me, I cannot speake your England O faire Katherine, if you will loue me soundly with your French heart, I will be glad to heare you confesse it brokenly with your English Tongue. Doe you like me, Kate? Kath. Pardonne moy, I cannot tell wat is like me An Angell is like you Kate, and you are like an Angell Que dit il que Ie suis semblable a les Anges? Ouy verayment (sauf vostre Grace) ainsi dit il I said so, deare Katherine, and I must not blush to affirme it O bon Dieu, les langues des hommes sont plein de tromperies What sayes she, faire one? that the tongues of men are full of deceits? Ouy, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of deceits: dat is de Princesse The Princesse is the better English-woman: yfaith Kate, my wooing is fit for thy vnderstanding, I am glad thou canst speake no better English, for if thou could'st, thou would'st finde me such a plaine King, that thou wouldst thinke, I had sold my Farme to buy my Crowne. I know no wayes to mince it in loue, but directly to say, I loue you; then if you vrge me farther, then to say, Doe you in faith? I weare out my suite: Giue me your answer, yfaith doe, and so clap hands, and a bargaine: how say you, Lady? Kath. Sauf vostre honeur, me vnderstand well Marry, if you would put me to Verses, or to Dance for your sake, Kate, why you vndid me: for the one I haue neither words nor measure; and for the other, I haue no strength in measure, yet a reasonable measure in strength. If I could winne a Lady at Leape-frogge, or by vawting into my Saddle, with my Armour on my backe; vnder the correction of bragging be it spoken. I should quickly leape into a Wife: Or if I might buffet for my Loue, or bound my Horse for her fauours, I could lay on like a Butcher, and sit like a Iack an Apes, neuer off. But before God Kate, I cannot looke greenely, nor gaspe out my eloquence, nor I haue no cunning in protestation; onely downe-right Oathes, which I neuer vse till vrg'd, nor neuer breake for vrging. If thou canst loue a fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth Sunne-burning? that neuer lookes in his Glasse, for loue of any thing he sees there? let thine Eye be thy Cooke. I speake to thee plaine Souldier: If thou canst loue me for this, take me? if not? to say to thee that I shall dye, is true; but for thy loue, by the L. No: yet I loue thee too. And while thou liu'st, deare Kate, take a fellow of plaine and vncoyned Constancie, for he perforce must do thee right, because he hath not the gift to wooe in other places: for these fellowes of infinit tongue, that can ryme themselues into Ladyes fauours, they doe alwayes reason themselues out againe. What? a speaker is but a prater, a Ryme is but a Ballad; a good Legge will fall, a strait Backe will stoope, a blacke Beard will turne white, a curl'd Pate will grow bald, a faire Face will wither, a full Eye will wax hollow: but a good Heart, Kate, is the Sunne and the Moone, or rather the Sunne, and not the Moone; for it shines bright, and neuer changes, but keepes his course truly. If thou would haue such a one, take me? and take me; take a Souldier: take a Souldier; take a King. And what say'st thou then to my Loue? speake my faire, and fairely, I pray thee Is it possible dat I sould loue de ennemie of Fraunce? King. No, it is not possible you should loue the Enemie of France, Kate; but in louing me, you should loue the Friend of France: for I loue France so well, that I will not part with a Village of it; I will haue it all mine: and Kate, when France is mine, and I am yours; then yours is France, and you are mine I cannot tell wat is dat No, Kate? I will tell thee in French, which I am sure will hang vpon my tongue, like a new-married Wife about her Husbands Necke, hardly to be shooke off; Ie quand sur le possession de Fraunce, & quand vous aues le possession de moy. (Let mee see, what then? Saint Dennis bee my speede) Donc vostre est Fraunce, & vous estes mienne. It is as easie for me, Kate, to conquer the Kingdome, as to speake so much more French: I shall neuer moue thee in French, vnlesse it be to laugh at me Sauf vostre honeur, le Francois ques vous parleis, il & melieus que l' Anglois le quel Ie parle No faith is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of my Tongue, and I thine, most truely falsely, must needes be graunted to be much at one. But Kate, doo'st thou vnderstand thus much English? Canst thou loue mee? Kath. I cannot tell Can any of your Neighbours tell, Kate? Ile aske them. Come, I know thou louest me: and at night, when you come into your Closet, you'le question this Gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to her disprayse those parts in me, that you loue with your heart: but good Kate, mocke me mercifully, the rather gentle Princesse, because I loue thee cruelly. If euer thou beest mine, Kate, as I haue a sauing Faith within me tells me thou shalt; I get thee with skambling, and thou must therefore needes proue a good Souldier-breeder: Shall not thou and I, betweene Saint Dennis and Saint George, compound a Boy, halfe French halfe English, that shall goe to Constantinople, and take the Turke by the Beard. Shall wee not? what say'st thou, my faire Flower-de-Luce I doe not know dat No: 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: doe but now promise Kate, you will endeauour for your French part of such a Boy; and for my English moytie, take the Word of a King, and a Batcheler. How answer you. La plus belle Katherine du monde mon trescher & deuin deesse Your Maiestee aue fause Frenche enough to deceiue de most sage Damoiseil dat is en Fraunce Now fye vpon my false French: by mine Honor in true English, I loue thee Kate; by which Honor, I dare not sweare thou louest me, yet my blood begins to flatter me, that thou doo'st; notwithstanding the poore and vntempering effect of my Visage. Now beshrew my Fathers Ambition, hee was thinking of Ciuill Warres when hee got me, therefore was I created with a stubborne out-side, with an aspect of Iron, that when I come to wooe Ladyes, I fright them: but in faith Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appeare. My comfort is, that Old Age, that ill layer vp of Beautie, can doe no more spoyle vpon my Face. Thou hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou shalt weare me, if thou weare me, better and better: and therefore tell me, most faire Katherine, will you haue me? Put off your Maiden Blushes, auouch the Thoughts of your Heart with the Lookes of an Empresse, take me by the Hand, and say, Harry of England, I am thine: which Word thou shalt no sooner blesse mine Eare withall, but I will tell thee alowd, England is thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Henry Plantaginet is thine; who, though I speake it before his Face, if he be not Fellow with the best King, thou shalt finde the best King of Good-fellowes. Come your Answer in broken Musick; for thy Voyce is Musick, and thy English broken: Therefore Queene of all, Katherine, breake thy minde to me in broken English; wilt thou haue me? Kath. Dat is as it shall please de Roy mon pere Nay, it will please him well, Kate; it shall please him, Kate Den it sall also content me Vpon that I kisse your Hand, and I call you my Queene Laisse mon Seigneur, laisse, laisse, may foy: Ie ne veus point que vous abbaisse vostre grandeus, en baisant le main d' une nostre Seigneur indignie seruiteur excuse moy. Ie vous supplie mon tres-puissant Seigneur Then I will kisse your Lippes, Kate Les Dames & Damoisels pour estre baisee deuant leur nopcese il net pas le costume de Fraunce Madame, my Interpreter, what sayes shee? Dat it is not be de fashon pour le Ladies of Fraunce; I cannot tell wat is buisse en Anglish To kisse Your Maiestee entendre bettre que moy It is not a fashion for the Maids in Fraunce to kisse before they are marryed, would she say? Ouy verayment O Kate, nice Customes cursie to great Kings. Deare Kate, you and I cannot bee confin'd within the weake Lyst of a Countreyes fashion: wee are the makers of Manners, Kate; and the libertie that followes our Places, stoppes the mouth of all finde-faults, as I will doe yours, for vpholding the nice fashion of your Countrey, in denying me a Kisse: therefore patiently, and yeelding. You haue Witch-craft in your Lippes, Kate: there is more eloquence in a Sugar touch of them, then in the Tongues of the French Councell; and they should sooner perswade Harry of England, then a generall Petition of Monarchs. Heere comes your Enter the French Power, and the English Lords. God saue your Maiestie, my Royall Cousin, teach you our Princesse English? I would haue her learne, my faire Cousin, how perfectly I loue her, and that is good English Is shee not apt? King. Our Tongue is rough, Coze, and my Condition is not smooth: so that hauing neyther the Voyce nor the Heart of Flatterie about me, I cannot so coniure vp the Spirit of Loue in her, that hee will appeare in his true likenesse Pardon the franknesse of my mirth, if I answer you for that. If you would coniure in her, you must make a Circle: if coniure vp Loue in her in his true likenesse, hee must appeare naked, and blinde. Can you blame her then, being a Maid, yet ros'd ouer with the Virgin Crimson of Modestie, if shee deny the apparance of a naked blinde Boy in her naked seeing selfe? It were (my Lord) a hard Condition for a Maid to consigne to Yet they doe winke and yeeld, as Loue is blind and enforces They are then excus'd, my Lord, when they see not what they doe Then good my Lord, teach your Cousin to consent winking I will winke on her to consent, my Lord, if you will teach her to know my meaning: for Maides well Summer'd, and warme kept, are like Flyes at Bartholomew-tyde, blinde, though they haue their eyes, and then they will endure handling, which before would not abide looking on This Morall tyes me ouer to Time, and a hot Summer; and so I shall catch the Flye, your Cousin, in the latter end, and she must be blinde to As Loue is my Lord, before it loues It is so: and you may, some of you, thanke Loue for my blindnesse, who cannot see many a faire French Citie for one faire French Maid that stands in my way French King. Yes my Lord, you see them perspectiuely: the Cities turn'd into a Maid; for they are all gyrdled with Maiden Walls, that Warre hath entred Shall Kate be my Wife? So please you I am content, so the Maiden Cities you talke of, may wait on her: so the Maid that stood in the way for my Wish, shall shew me the way to my Will Wee haue consented to all tearmes of reason Is't so, my Lords of England? The King hath graunted euery Article: His Daughter first; and in sequele, all, According to their firme proposed natures Onely he hath not yet subscribed this: Where your Maiestie demands, That the King of France hauing any occasion to write for matter of Graunt, shall name your Highnesse in this forme, and with this addition, in French: Nostre trescher filz Henry Roy d' Angleterre Heretere de Fraunce: and thus in Latine; Praeclarissimus Filius noster Henricus Rex Angliæ & Heres Franciae Nor this I haue not Brother so deny'd, But your request shall make me let it passe I pray you then, in loue and deare allyance, Let that one Article ranke with the rest, And thereupon giue me your Daughter Take her faire Sonne, and from her blood rayse vp Issue to me, that the contending Kingdomes Of France and England, whose very shoares looke pale, With enuy of each others happinesse, May cease their hatred; and this deare Coniunction Plant Neighbour-hood and Christian-like accord In their sweet Bosomes: that neuer Warre aduance His bleeding Sword 'twixt England and faire France Amen Now welcome Kate: and beare me witnesse all, That here I kisse her as my Soueraigne Queene. God, the best maker of all Marriages, Combine your hearts in one, your Realmes in one: As Man and Wife being two, are one in loue, So be there 'twixt your Kingdomes such a Spousall, That neuer may ill Office, or fell Iealousie, Which troubles oft the Bed of blessed Marriage, Thrust in betweene the Paction of these Kingdomes, To make diuorce of their incorporate League: That English may as French, French Englishmen, Receiue each other. God speake this Amen Amen Prepare we for our Marriage: on which day, My Lord of Burgundy wee'le take your Oath And all the Peeres, for suretie of our Leagues. Then shall I sweare to Kate, and you to me, And may our Oathes well kept and prosp'rous be. Exeunt. Thus farre with rough, and all-vnable Pen, Our bending Author hath pursu'd the Story, In little roome confining mightie men, Mangling by starts the full course of their glory. Small time: but in that small, most greatly liued This Starre of England. Fortune made his Sword; By which, the Worlds best Garden he atchieued: And of it left his Sonne Imperiall Lord. Henry the Sixt, in Infant Bands crown'd King Of France and England, did this King succeed: Whose State so many had the managing, That they lost France, and made his England bleed: Which oft our Stage hath showne; and for their sake, In your faire minds let this acceptance take. Hence: home you idle Creatures, get you home: Is this a Holiday? What, know you not (Being Mechanicall) you ought not walke Vpon a labouring day, without the signe Of your Profession? Speake, what Trade art thou? Why Sir, a Carpenter Where is thy Leather Apron, and thy Rule? What dost thou with thy best Apparrell on? You sir, what Trade are you? Truely Sir, in respect of a fine Workman, I am but as you would say, a Cobler But what Trade art thou? Answer me directly A Trade Sir, that I hope I may vse, with a safe Conscience, which is indeed Sir, a Mender of bad soules What Trade thou knaue? Thou naughty knaue, what Trade? Nay I beseech you Sir, be not out with me: yet if you be out Sir, I can mend you What mean'st thou by that? Mend mee, thou sawcy Fellow? Why sir, Cobble you Thou art a Cobler, art thou? Truly sir, all that I liue by, is with the Aule: I meddle with no Tradesmans matters, nor womens matters; but withal I am indeed Sir, a Surgeon to old shooes: when they are in great danger, I recouer them. As proper men as euer trod vpon Neats Leather, haue gone vpon my handy-worke But wherefore art not in thy Shop to day? Why do'st thou leade these men about the streets? Truly sir, to weare out their shooes, to get my selfe into more worke. But indeede sir, we make Holyday to see Caesar, and to reioyce in his Triumph Wherefore reioyce? What Conquest brings he home? What Tributaries follow him to Rome, To grace in Captiue bonds his Chariot Wheeles? You Blockes, you stones, you worse then senslesse things: O you hard hearts, you cruell men of Rome, Knew you not Pompey many a time and oft? Haue you climb'd vp to Walles and Battlements, To Towres and Windowes? Yea, to Chimney tops, Your Infants in your Armes, and there haue sate The liue-long day, with patient expectation, To see great Pompey passe the streets of Rome: And when you saw his Chariot but appeare, Haue you not made an Vniuersall shout, That Tyber trembled vnderneath her bankes To heare the replication of your sounds, Made in her Concaue Shores? And do you now put on your best attyre? And do you now cull out a Holyday? And do you now strew Flowers in his way, That comes in Triumph ouer Pompeyes blood? Be gone, Runne to your houses, fall vpon your knees, Pray to the Gods to intermit the plague That needs must light on this Ingratitude Go, go, good Countrymen, and for this fault Assemble all the poore men of your sort; Draw them to Tyber bankes, and weepe your teares Into the Channell, till the lowest streame Do kisse the most exalted Shores of all. See where their basest mettle be not mou'd, They vanish tongue-tyed in their guiltinesse: Go you downe that way towards the Capitoll, This way will I: Disrobe the Images, If you do finde them deckt with Ceremonies May we do so? You know it is the Feast of Lupercall It is no matter, let no Images Be hung with Caesars Trophees: Ile about, And driue away the Vulgar from the streets; So do you too, where you perceiue them thicke. These growing Feathers, pluckt from Caesars wing, Will make him flye an ordinary pitch, Who else would soare aboue the view of men, And keepe vs all in seruile fearefulnesse. Cicero, Brutus, Cassius, Caska, a Soothsayer: after them Murellus and Calphurnia Peace ho, Caesar speakes Calphurnia Heere my Lord Stand you directly in Antonio's way, When he doth run his course. Antonio Cæsar, my Lord Forget not in your speed Antonio, To touch Calphurnia: for our Elders say, The Barren touched in this holy chace, Shake off their sterrile curse I shall remember, When Caesar sayes, Do this; it is perform'd Set on, and leaue no Ceremony out Caesar Ha? Who calles? Bid euery noyse be still: peace yet againe Who is it in the presse, that calles on me? I heare a Tongue shriller then all the Musicke Cry, Caesar: Speake, Caesar is turn'd to heare Beware the Ides of March What man is that? A Sooth-sayer bids you beware the Ides of March Set him before me, let me see his face Fellow, come from the throng, look vpon Caesar What sayst thou to me now? Speak once againe, Beware the Ides of March He is a Dreamer, let vs leaue him: Passe. Will you go see the order of the course? Not I I pray you do I am not Gamesom: I do lacke some part Of that quicke Spirit that is in Antony: Let me not hinder Cassius your desires; Ile leaue you Brutus, I do obserue you now of late: I haue not from your eyes, that gentlenesse And shew of Loue, as I was wont to haue: You beare too stubborne, and too strange a hand Ouer your Friend, that loues you Cassius, Be not deceiu'd: If I haue veyl'd my looke, I turne the trouble of my Countenance Meerely vpon my selfe. Vexed I am Of late, with passions of some difference, Conceptions onely proper to my selfe, Which giue some soyle (perhaps) to my Behauiours: But let not therefore my good Friends be greeu'd (Among which number Cassius be you one) Nor construe any further my neglect, Then that poore Brutus with himselfe at warre, Forgets the shewes of Loue to other men Then Brutus, I haue much mistook your passion, By meanes whereof, this Brest of mine hath buried Thoughts of great value, worthy Cogitations. Tell me good Brutus, Can you see your face? No Cassius: For the eye sees not it selfe but by reflection, By some other things 'Tis iust, And it is very much lamented Brutus, That you haue no such Mirrors, as will turne Your hidden worthinesse into your eye, That you might see your shadow: I haue heard, Where many of the best respect in Rome, (Except immortall Caesar) speaking of Brutus, And groaning vnderneath this Ages yoake, Haue wish'd, that Noble Brutus had his eyes Into what dangers, would you Leade me Cassius? That you would haue me seeke into my selfe, For that which is not in me? Therefore good Brutus, be prepar'd to heare: And since you know, you cannot see your selfe So well as by Reflection; I your Glasse, Will modestly discouer to your selfe That of your selfe, which you yet know not of. And be not iealous on me, gentle Brutus: Were I a common Laughter, or did vse To stale with ordinary Oathes my loue To euery new Protester: if you know, That I do fawne on men, and hugge them hard, And after scandall them: Or if you know, That I professe my selfe in Banquetting To all the Rout, then hold me dangerous. What meanes this Showting? I do feare, the People choose Caesar For their King I, do you feare it? Then must I thinke you would not haue it so I would not Cassius, yet I loue him well: But wherefore do you hold me heere so long? What is it, that you would impart to me? If it be ought toward the generall good, Set Honor in one eye, and Death i'th other, And I will looke on both indifferently: For let the Gods so speed mee, as I loue The name of Honor, more then I feare death I know that vertue to be in you Brutus, As well as I do know your outward fauour. Well, Honor is the subiect of my Story: I cannot tell, what you and other men Thinke of this life: But for my single selfe, I had as liefe not be, as liue to be In awe of such a Thing, as I my selfe. I was borne free as Caesar, so were you, We both haue fed as well, and we can both Endure the Winters cold, as well as hee. For once, vpon a Rawe and Gustie day, The troubled Tyber, chafing with her Shores, Caesar saide to me, Dar'st thou Cassius now Leape in with me into this angry Flood, And swim to yonder Point? Vpon the word, Accoutred as I was, I plunged in, And bad him follow: so indeed he did. The Torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it With lusty Sinewes, throwing it aside, And stemming it with hearts of Controuersie. But ere we could arriue the Point propos'd, Caesar cride, Helpe me Cassius, or I sinke. I (as Aeneas, our great Ancestor, Did from the Flames of Troy, vpon his shoulder The old Anchyses beare) so, from the waues of Tyber Did I the tyred Caesar: And this Man, Is now become a God, and Cassius is A wretched Creature, and must bend his body, If Caesar carelesly but nod on him. He had a Feauer when he was in Spaine, And when the Fit was on him, I did marke How he did shake: Tis true, this God did shake, His Coward lippes did from their colour flye, And that same Eye, whose bend doth awe the World, Did loose his Lustre: I did heare him grone: I, and that Tongue of his, that bad the Romans Marke him, and write his Speeches in their Bookes, Alas, it cried, Giue me some drinke Titinius, As a sicke Girle: Ye Gods, it doth amaze me, A man of such a feeble temper should So get the start of the Maiesticke world, And beare the Palme alone. Flourish. Another generall shout? I do beleeue, that these applauses are For some new Honors, that are heap'd on Caesar Why man, he doth bestride the narrow world Like a Colossus, and we petty men Walke vnder his huge legges, and peepe about To finde our selues dishonourable Graues. Men at sometime, are Masters of their Fates. The fault (deere Brutus) is not in our Starres, But in our Selues, that we are vnderlings. Brutus and Caesar: What should be in that Caesar? Why should that name be sounded more then yours Write them together: Yours, is as faire a Name: Sound them, it doth become the mouth aswell: Weigh them, it is as heauy: Coniure with 'em, Brutus will start a Spirit as soone as Caesar. Now in the names of all the Gods at once, Vpon what meate doth this our Caesar feede, That he is growne so great? Age, thou art sham'd. Rome, thou hast lost the breed of Noble Bloods. When went there by an Age, since the great Flood, But it was fam'd with more then with one man? When could they say (till now) that talk'd of Rome, That her wide Walkes incompast but one man? Now is it Rome indeed, and Roome enough When there is in it but one onely man. O! you and I, haue heard our Fathers say, There was a Brutus once, that would haue brook'd Th' eternall Diuell to keepe his State in Rome, As easily as a King That you do loue me, I am nothing iealous: What you would worke me too, I haue some ayme: How I haue thought of this, and of these times I shall recount heereafter. For this present, I would not so (with loue I might intreat you) Be any further moou'd: What you haue said, I will consider: what you haue to say I will with patience heare, and finde a time Both meete to heare, and answer such high things. Till then, my Noble Friend, chew vpon this: Brutus had rather be a Villager, Then to repute himselfe a Sonne of Rome Vnder these hard Conditions, as this time Is like to lay vpon vs I am glad that my weake words Haue strucke but thus much shew of fire from Brutus, The Games are done, And Caesar is returning As they passe by, Plucke Caska by the Sleeue, And he will (after his sowre fashion) tell you What hath proceeded worthy note to day I will do so: but looke you Cassius, The angry spot doth glow on Caesars brow, And all the rest, looke like a chidden Traine; Calphurnia's Cheeke is pale, and Cicero Lookes with such Ferret, and such fiery eyes As we haue seene him in the Capitoll Being crost in Conference, by some Senators Caska will tell vs what the matter is Caes Antonio Caesar Caes Let me haue men about me, that are fat, Sleeke-headed men, and such as sleepe a-nights: Yond Cassius has a leane and hungry looke, He thinkes too much: such men are dangerous Feare him not Caesar, he's not dangerous, He is a Noble Roman, and well giuen Caes Would he were fatter; But I feare him not: Yet if my name were lyable to feare, I do not know the man I should auoyd So soone as that spare Cassius. He reades much, He is a great Obseruer, and he lookes Quite through the Deeds of men. He loues no Playes, As thou dost Antony: he heares no Musicke; Seldome he smiles, and smiles in such a sort As if he mock'd himselfe, and scorn'd his spirit That could be mou'd to smile at any thing. Such men as he, be neuer at hearts ease, Whiles they behold a greater then themselues, And therefore are they very dangerous. I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd, Then what I feare: for alwayes I am Caesar. Come on my right hand, for this eare is deafe, And tell me truely, what thou think'st of him. You pul'd me by the cloake, would you speake with me? I Caska, tell vs what hath chanc'd to day That Caesar lookes so sad Why you were with him, were you not? I should not then aske Caska what had chanc'd Why there was a Crowne offer'd him; & being offer'd him, he put it by with the backe of his hand thus, and then the people fell a shouting What was the second noyse for? Why for that too They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for? Why for that too Was the Crowne offer'd him thrice? I marry was't, and hee put it by thrice, euerie time gentler then other; and at euery putting by, mine honest Neighbors showted Who offer'd him the Crowne? Why Antony Tell vs the manner of it, gentle Caska I can as well bee hang'd as tell the manner of it: It was meere Foolerie, I did not marke it. I sawe Marke Antony offer him a Crowne, yet 'twas not a Crowne neyther, 'twas one of these Coronets: and as I told you, hee put it by once: but for all that, to my thinking, he would faine haue had it. Then hee offered it to him againe: then hee put it by againe: but to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his fingers off it. And then he offered it the third time; hee put it the third time by, and still as hee refus'd it, the rabblement howted, and clapp'd their chopt hands, and threw vppe their sweatie Night-cappes, and vttered such a deale of stinking breath, because Caesar refus'd the Crowne, that it had (almost) choaked Caesar: for hee swoonded, and fell downe at it: And for mine owne part, I durst not laugh, for feare of opening my Lippes, and receyuing the bad Ayre But soft I pray you: what, did Caesar swound? He fell downe in the Market-place, and foam'd at mouth, and was speechlesse 'Tis very like he hath the Falling sicknesse No, Caesar hath it not: but you, and I, And honest Caska, we haue the Falling sicknesse I know not what you meane by that, but I am sure Caesar fell downe. If the tag-ragge people did not clap him, and hisse him, according as he pleas'd, and displeas'd them, as they vse to doe the Players in the Theatre, I am no true man What said he, when he came vnto himselfe? Marry, before he fell downe, when he perceiu'd the common Heard was glad he refus'd the Crowne, he pluckt me ope his Doublet, and offer'd them his Throat to cut: and I had beene a man of any Occupation, if I would not haue taken him at a word, I would I might goe to Hell among the Rogues, and so hee fell. When he came to himselfe againe, hee said, If hee had done, or said any thing amisse, he desir'd their Worships to thinke it was his infirmitie. Three or foure Wenches where I stood, cryed, Alasse good Soule, and forgaue him with all their hearts: But there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had stab'd their Mothers, they would haue done no lesse And after that, he came thus sad away Did Cicero say any thing? I, he spoke Greeke To what effect? Nay, and I tell you that, Ile ne're looke you i'th' face againe. But those that vnderstood him, smil'd at one another, and shooke their heads: but for mine owne part, it was Greeke to me. I could tell you more newes too: Murrellus and Flauius, for pulling Scarffes off Caesars Images, are put to silence. Fare you well. There was more Foolerie yet, if I could remember it Will you suppe with me to Night, Caska? No, I am promis'd forth Will you Dine with me to morrow? I, if I be aliue, and your minde hold, and your Dinner worth the eating Good, I will expect you Doe so: farewell both. What a blunt fellow is this growne to be? He was quick Mettle, when he went to Schoole So is he now, in execution Of any bold, or Noble Enterprize, How-euer he puts on this tardie forme: This Rudenesse is a Sawce to his good Wit, Which giues men stomacke to disgest his words With better Appetite And so it is: For this time I will leaue you: To morrow, if you please to speake with me, I will come home to you: or if you will, Come home to me, and I will wait for you I will doe so: till then, thinke of the World. Well Brutus, thou art Noble: yet I see, Thy Honorable Mettle may be wrought From that it is dispos'd: therefore it is meet, That Noble mindes keepe euer with their likes: For who so firme, that cannot be seduc'd? Caesar doth beare me hard, but he loues Brutus. If I were Brutus now, and he were Cassius, He should not humor me. I will this Night, In seuerall Hands, in at his Windowes throw, As if they came from seuerall Citizens, Writings, all tending to the great opinion That Rome holds of his Name: wherein obscurely Caesars Ambition shall be glanced at. And after this, let Caesar seat him sure, For wee will shake him, or worse dayes endure. Thunder, and Lightning. Enter Caska, and Cicero. Good euen, Caska: brought you Caesar home? Why are you breathlesse, and why stare you so? Are not you mou'd, when all the sway of Earth Shakes, like a thing vnfirme? O Cicero, I haue seene Tempests, when the scolding Winds Haue riu'd the knottie Oakes, and I haue seene Th' ambitious Ocean swell, and rage, and foame, To be exalted with the threatning Clouds: But neuer till to Night, neuer till now, Did I goe through a Tempest-dropping-fire. Eyther there is a Ciuill strife in Heauen, Or else the World, too sawcie with the Gods, Incenses them to send destruction Why, saw you any thing more wonderfull? A common slaue, you know him well by sight, Held vp his left Hand, which did flame and burne Like twentie Torches ioyn'd; and yet his Hand, Not sensible of fire, remain'd vnscorch'd. Besides, I ha' not since put vp my Sword, Against the Capitoll I met a Lyon, Who glaz'd vpon me, and went surly by, Without annoying me. And there were drawne Vpon a heape, a hundred gastly Women, Transformed with their feare, who swore, they saw Men, all in fire, walke vp and downe the streetes. And yesterday, the Bird of Night did sit, Euen at Noone-day, vpon the Market place, Howting, and shreeking. When these Prodigies Doe so conioyntly meet, let not men say, These are their Reasons, they are Naturall: For I beleeue, they are portentous things Vnto the Clymate, that they point vpon Indeed, it is a strange disposed time: But men may construe things after their fashion, Cleane from the purpose of the things themselues. Comes Caesar to the Capitoll to morrow? He doth: for he did bid Antonio Send word to you, he would be there to morrow Good-night then, Caska: This disturbed Skie is not to walke in Farewell Cicero. Who's there? A Romane Caska, by your Voyce Your Eare is good. Cassius, what Night is this? A very pleasing Night to honest men Who euer knew the Heauens menace so? Those that haue knowne the Earth so full of faults. For my part, I haue walk'd about the streets, Submitting me vnto the perillous Night; And thus vnbraced, Caska, as you see, Haue bar'd my Bosome to the Thunder-stone: And when the crosse blew Lightning seem'd to open The Brest of Heauen, I did present my selfe Euen in the ayme, and very flash of it But wherefore did you so much tempt the Heauens? It is the part of men, to feare and tremble, When the most mightie Gods, by tokens send Such dreadfull Heraulds, to astonish vs You are dull, Caska: And those sparkes of Life, that should be in a Roman, You doe want, or else you vse not. You looke pale, and gaze, and put on feare, And cast your selfe in wonder, To see the strange impatience of the Heauens: But if you would consider the true cause, Why all these Fires, why all these gliding Ghosts, Why Birds and Beasts, from qualitie and kinde, Why Old men, Fooles, and Children calculate, Why all these things change from their Ordinance, Their Natures, and pre-formed Faculties, To monstrous qualitie; why you shall finde, That Heauen hath infus'd them with these Spirits, To make them Instruments of feare, and warning, Vnto some monstrous State. Now could I (Caska) name to thee a man, Most like this dreadfull Night, That Thunders, Lightens, opens Graues, and roares, As doth the Lyon in the Capitoll: A man no mightier then thy selfe, or me, In personall action; yet prodigious growne, And fearefull, as these strange eruptions are 'Tis Caesar that you meane: Is it not, Cassius? Let it be who it is: for Romans now Haue Thewes, and Limbes, like to their Ancestors; But woe the while, our Fathers mindes are dead, And we are gouern'd with our Mothers spirits, Our yoake, and sufferance, shew vs Womanish Indeed, they say, the Senators to morrow Meane to establish Caesar as a King: And he shall weare his Crowne by Sea, and Land, In euery place, saue here in Italy I know where I will weare this Dagger then; Cassius from Bondage will deliuer Cassius: Therein, yee Gods, you make the weake most strong; Therein, yee Gods, you Tyrants doe defeat. Nor Stonie Tower, nor Walls of beaten Brasse, Nor ayre-lesse Dungeon, nor strong Linkes of Iron, Can be retentiue to the strength of spirit: But Life being wearie of these worldly Barres, Neuer lacks power to dismisse it selfe. If I know this, know all the World besides, That part of Tyrannie that I doe beare, I can shake off at pleasure. Thunder still. So can I: So euery Bond-man in his owne hand beares The power to cancell his Captiuitie And why should Cæsar be a Tyrant then? Poore man, I know he would not be a Wolfe, But that he sees the Romans are but Sheepe: He were no Lyon, were not Romans Hindes. Those that with haste will make a mightie fire, Begin it with weake Strawes. What trash is Rome? What Rubbish, and what Offall? when it serues For the base matter, to illuminate So vile a thing as Caesar. But oh Griefe, Where hast thou led me? I (perhaps) speake this Before a willing Bond-man: then I know My answere must be made. But I am arm'd, And dangers are to me indifferent You speake to Caska, and to such a man, That is no flearing Tell-tale. Hold, my Hand: Be factious for redresse of all these Griefes, And I will set this foot of mine as farre, As who goes farthest There's a Bargaine made. Now know you, Caska, I haue mou'd already Some certaine of the Noblest minded Romans To vnder-goe, with me, an Enterprize, Of Honorable dangerous consequence; And I doe know by this, they stay for me In Pompeyes Porch: for now this fearefull Night, There is no stirre, or walking in the streetes; And the Complexion of the Element Is Fauors, like the Worke we haue in hand, Most bloodie, fierie, and most terrible. Stand close a while, for heere comes one in haste 'Tis Cinna, I doe know him by his Gate, He is a friend. Cinna, where haste you so? To finde out you: Who's that, Metellus Cymber? No, it is Caska, one incorporate To our Attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna? I am glad on't. What a fearefull Night is this? There's two or three of vs haue seene strange sights Am I not stay'd for? tell me Yes, you are. O Cassius, If you could but winne the Noble Brutus To our party- Be you content. Good Cinna, take this Paper, And looke you lay it in the Pretors Chayre, Where Brutus may but finde it: and throw this In at his Window; set this vp with Waxe Vpon old Brutus Statue: all this done, Repaire to Pompeyes Porch, where you shall finde vs. Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there? All, but Metellus Cymber, and hee's gone To seeke you at your house. Well, I will hie, And so bestow these Papers as you bad me That done, repayre to Pompeyes Theater. Come Caska, you and I will yet, ere day, See Brutus at his house: three parts of him Is ours alreadie, and the man entire Vpon the next encounter, yeelds him ours O, he sits high in all the Peoples hearts: And that which would appeare Offence in vs, His Countenance, like richest Alchymie, Will change to Vertue, and to Worthinesse Him, and his worth, and our great need of him, You haue right well conceited: let vs goe, For it is after Mid-night, and ere day, We will awake him, and be sure of him. What Lucius, hoe? I cannot, by the progresse of the Starres, Giue guesse how neere to day- Lucius, I say? I would it were my fault to sleepe so soundly. When Lucius, when? awake, I say: what Lucius? Call'd you, my Lord? Get me a Tapor in my Study, Lucius: When it is lighted, come and call me here I will, my Lord. It must be by his death: and for my part, I know no personall cause, to spurne at him, But for the generall. He would be crown'd: How that might change his nature, there's the question? It is the bright day, that brings forth the Adder, And that craues warie walking: Crowne him that, And then I graunt we put a Sting in him, That at his will he may doe danger with. Th' abuse of Greatnesse, is, when it dis-ioynes Remorse from Power: And to speake truth of Caesar, I haue not knowne, when his Affections sway'd More then his Reason. But 'tis a common proofe, That Lowlynesse is young Ambitions Ladder, Whereto the Climber vpward turnes his Face: But when he once attaines the vpmost Round, He then vnto the Ladder turnes his Backe, Lookes in the Clouds, scorning the base degrees By which he did ascend: so Caesar may; Then least he may, preuent. And since the Quarrell Will beare no colour, for the thing he is, Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented, Would runne to these, and these extremities: And therefore thinke him as a Serpents egge, Which hatch'd, would as his kinde grow mischieuous; And kill him in the shell. The Taper burneth in your Closet, Sir: Searching the Window for a Flint, I found This Paper, thus seal'd vp, and I am sure It did not lye there when I went to Bed. Giues him the Letter. Get you to Bed againe, it is not day: Is not to morrow (Boy) the first of March? I know not, Sir Looke in the Calender, and bring me word I will, Sir. The exhalations, whizzing in the ayre, Giue so much light, that I may reade by them. Opens the Letter, and reades. Brutus thou sleep'st; awake, and see thy selfe: Shall Rome, &c. speake, strike, redresse. Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake. Such instigations haue beene often dropt, Where I haue tooke them vp: Shall Rome, &c. Thus must I piece it out: Shall Rome stand vnder one mans awe? What Rome? My Ancestors did from the streetes of Rome The Tarquin driue, when he was call'd a King. Speake, strike, redresse. Am I entreated To speake, and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise, If the redresse will follow, thou receiuest Thy full Petition at the hand of Brutus. Sir, March is wasted fifteene dayes. Knocke within. 'Tis good. Go to the Gate, some body knocks: Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar, I haue not slept. Betweene the acting of a dreadfull thing, And the first motion, all the Interim is Like a Phantasma, or a hideous Dreame: The Genius, and the mortall Instruments Are then in councell; and the state of a man, Like to a little Kingdome, suffers then The nature of an Insurrection. Sir, 'tis your Brother Cassius at the Doore, Who doth desire to see you Is he alone? No, Sir, there are moe with him Doe you know them? No, Sir, their Hats are pluckt about their Eares, And halfe their Faces buried in their Cloakes, That by no meanes I may discouer them, By any marke of fauour Let 'em enter: They are the Faction. O Conspiracie, Sham'st thou to shew thy dang'rous Brow by Night, When euills are most free? O then, by day Where wilt thou finde a Cauerne darke enough, To maske thy monstrous Visage? Seek none Conspiracie, Hide it in Smiles, and Affabilitie: For if thou path thy natiue semblance on, Not Erebus it selfe were dimme enough, To hide thee from preuention. and I thinke we are too bold vpon your Rest: Good morrow Brutus, doe we trouble you? I haue beene vp this howre, awake all Night: Know I these men, that come along with you? Yes, euery man of them; and no man here But honors you: and euery one doth wish, You had but that opinion of your selfe, Which euery Noble Roman beares of you. This is Trebonius He is welcome hither This, Decius Brutus He is welcome too This, Caska; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cymber They are all welcome. What watchfull Cares doe interpose themselues Betwixt your Eyes, and Night? Shall I entreat a word? They whisper. Here lyes the East: doth not the Day breake heere? No O pardon, Sir, it doth; and yon grey Lines, That fret the Clouds, are Messengers of Day You shall confesse, that you are both deceiu'd: Heere, as I point my Sword, the Sunne arises, Which is a great way growing on the South, Weighing the youthfull Season of the yeare. Some two moneths hence, vp higher toward the North He first presents his fire, and the high East Stands as the Capitoll, directly heere Giue me your hands all ouer, one by one And let vs sweare our Resolution No, not an Oath: if not the Face of men, The sufferance of our Soules, the times Abuse; If these be Motiues weake, breake off betimes, And euery man hence, to his idle bed: So let high-sighted-Tyranny range on, Till each man drop by Lottery. But if these (As I am sure they do) beare fire enough To kindle Cowards, and to steele with valour The melting Spirits of women. Then Countrymen, What neede we any spurre, but our owne cause To pricke vs to redresse? What other Bond, Then secret Romans, that haue spoke the word, And will not palter? And what other Oath, Then Honesty to Honesty ingag'd, That this shall be, or we will fall for it. Sweare Priests and Cowards, and men Cautelous Old feeble Carrions, and such suffering Soules That welcome wrongs: Vnto bad causes, sweare Such Creatures as men doubt; but do not staine The euen vertue of our Enterprize, Nor th' insuppressiue Mettle of our Spirits, To thinke, that or our Cause, or our Performance Did neede an Oath. When euery drop of blood That euery Roman beares, and Nobly beares Is guilty of a seuerall Bastardie, If he do breake the smallest Particle Of any promise that hath past from him But what of Cicero? Shall we sound him? I thinke he will stand very strong with vs Let vs not leaue him out No, by no meanes O let vs haue him, for his Siluer haires Will purchase vs a good opinion: And buy mens voyces, to commend our deeds: It shall be sayd, his iudgement rul'd our hands, Our youths, and wildenesse, shall no whit appeare, But all be buried in his Grauity O name him not; let vs not breake with him, For he will neuer follow any thing That other men begin Then leaue him out Indeed, he is not fit Shall no man else be toucht, but onely Caesar? Decius well vrg'd: I thinke it is not meet, Marke Antony, so well belou'd of Caesar, Should out-liue Caesar, we shall finde of him A shrew'd Contriuer. And you know, his meanes If he improue them, may well stretch so farre As to annoy vs all: which to preuent, Let Antony and Caesar fall together Our course will seeme too bloody, Caius Cassius, To cut the Head off, and then hacke the Limbes: Like Wrath in death, and Enuy afterwards: For Antony, is but a Limbe of Caesar. Let's be Sacrificers, but not Butchers Caius: We all stand vp against the spirit of Caesar, And in the Spirit of men, there is no blood: O that we then could come by Caesars Spirit, And not dismember Caesar! But (alas) Caesar must bleed for it. And gentle Friends, Let's kill him Boldly, but not Wrathfully: Let's carue him, as a Dish fit for the Gods, Not hew him as a Carkasse fit for Hounds: And let our Hearts, as subtle Masters do, Stirre vp their Seruants to an acte of Rage, And after seeme to chide 'em. This shall make Our purpose Necessary, and not Enuious. Which so appearing to the common eyes, We shall be call'd Purgers, not Murderers. And for Marke Antony, thinke not of him: For he can do no more then Caesars Arme, When Caesars head is off Yet I feare him, For in the ingrafted loue he beares to Caesar Alas, good Cassius, do not thinke of him: If he loue Caesar, all that he can do Is to himselfe; take thought, and dye for Caesar, And that were much he should: for he is giuen To sports, to wildenesse, and much company There is no feare in him; let him not dye, For he will liue, and laugh at this heereafter. Clocke strikes. Peace, count the Clocke The Clocke hath stricken three 'Tis time to part But it is doubtfull yet, Whether Caesar will come forth to day, or no: For he is Superstitious growne of late, Quite from the maine Opinion he held once, Of Fantasie, of Dreames, and Ceremonies: It may be, these apparant Prodigies, The vnaccustom'd Terror of this night, And the perswasion of his Augurers, May hold him from the Capitoll to day Neuer feare that: If he be so resolu'd, I can ore-sway him: For he loues to heare, That Vnicornes may be betray'd with Trees, And Beares with Glasses, Elephants with Holes, Lyons with Toyles, and men with Flatterers. But, when I tell him, he hates Flatterers, He sayes, he does; being then most flattered. Let me worke: For I can giue his humour the true bent; And I will bring him to the Capitoll Nay, we will all of vs, be there to fetch him By the eight houre, is that the vttermost? Be that the vttermost, and faile not then Caius Ligarius doth beare Caesar hard, Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey; I wonder none of you haue thought of him Now good Metellus go along by him: He loues me well, and I haue giuen him Reasons, Send him but hither, and Ile fashion him The morning comes vpon's: Wee'l leaue you Brutus, And Friends disperse your selues; but all remember What you haue said, and shew your selues true Romans Good Gentlemen, looke fresh and merrily, Let not our lookes put on our purposes, But beare it as our Roman Actors do, With vntyr'd Spirits, and formall Constancie, And so good morrow to you euery one. Manet Brutus. Boy: Lucius: Fast asleepe? It is no matter, Enioy the hony-heauy-Dew of Slumber: Thou hast no Figures, nor no Fantasies, Which busie care drawes, in the braines of men; Therefore thou sleep'st so sound. Brutus, my Lord Portia: What meane you? wherfore rise you now? It is not for your health, thus to commit Your weake condition, to the raw cold morning Nor for yours neither. Y'haue vngently Brutus Stole from my bed: and yesternight at Supper You sodainly arose, and walk'd about, Musing, and sighing, with your armes acrosse And when I ask'd you what the matter was, You star'd vpon me, with vngentle lookes. I vrg'd you further, then you scratch'd your head, And too impatiently stampt with your foote: Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not, But with an angry wafter of your hand Gaue signe for me to leaue you: So I did, Fearing to strengthen that impatience Which seem'd too much inkindled; and withall, Hoping it was but an effect of Humor, Which sometime hath his houre with euery man. It will not let you eate, nor talke, nor sleepe; And could it worke so much vpon your shape, As it hath much preuayl'd on your Condition, I should not know you Brutus. Deare my Lord, Make me acquainted with your cause of greefe I am not well in health, and that is all Brutus is wise, and were he not in health, He would embrace the meanes to come by it Why so I do: good Portia go to bed Is Brutus sicke? And is it Physicall To walke vnbraced, and sucke vp the humours Of the danke Morning? What, is Brutus sicke? And will he steale out of his wholsome bed To dare the vile contagion of the Night? And tempt the Rhewmy, and vnpurged Ayre, To adde vnto his sicknesse? No my Brutus, You haue some sicke Offence within your minde, Which by the Right and Vertue of my place I ought to know of: And vpon my knees, I charme you, by my once commended Beauty, By all your vowes of Loue, and that great Vow Which did incorporate and make vs one, That you vnfold to me, your selfe; your halfe Why you are heauy: and what men to night Haue had resort to you: for heere haue beene Some sixe or seuen, who did hide their faces Euen from darknesse Kneele not gentle Portia I should not neede, if you were gentle Brutus. Is it excepted, I should know no Secrets That appertaine to you? Am I your Selfe, But as it were in sort, or limitation? To keepe with you at Meales, comfort your Bed, And talke to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the Suburbs Of your good pleasure? If it be no more, Portia is Brutus Harlot, not his Wife You are my true and honourable Wife, As deere to me, as are the ruddy droppes That visit my sad heart If this were true, then should I know this secret. I graunt I am a Woman; but withall, A Woman that Lord Brutus tooke to Wife: I graunt I am a Woman; but withall, A Woman well reputed: Cato's Daughter. Thinke you, I am no stronger then my Sex Being so Father'd, and so Husbanded? Tell me your Counsels, I will not disclose 'em: I haue made strong proofe of my Constancie, Giuing my selfe a voluntary wound Heere, in the Thigh: Can I beare that with patience, And not my Husbands Secrets? O ye Gods! Render me worthy of this Noble Wife. Harke, harke, one knockes: Portia go in a while, And by and by thy bosome shall partake The secrets of my Heart. All my engagements, I will construe to thee, All the Charractery of my sad browes: Leaue me with hast. Lucius, who's that knockes Heere is a sicke man that would speak with you Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of. Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius, how? Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue O what a time haue you chose out braue Caius To weare a Kerchiefe? Would you were not sicke I am not sicke, if Brutus haue in hand Any exploit worthy the name of Honor Such an exploit haue I in hand Ligarius, Had you a healthfull eare to heare of it By all the Gods that Romans bow before, I heere discard my sicknesse. Soule of Rome, Braue Sonne, deriu'd from Honourable Loines, Thou like an Exorcist, hast coniur'd vp My mortified Spirit. Now bid me runne, And I will striue with things impossible, Yea get the better of them. What's to do? A peece of worke, That will make sicke men whole But are not some whole, that we must make sicke? That must we also. What it is my Caius, I shall vnfold to thee, as we are going, To whom it must be done Set on your foote, And with a heart new-fir'd, I follow you, To do I know not what: but it sufficeth That Brutus leads me on. Thunder Follow me then. Thunder & Lightning Nor Heauen, nor Earth, Haue beene at peace to night: Thrice hath Calphurnia, in her sleepe cryed out, Helpe, ho: They murther Caesar. Who's within? My Lord Caes Go bid the Priests do present Sacrifice, And bring me their opinions of Successe I will my Lord. What mean you Caesar? Think you to walk forth? You shall not stirre out of your house to day Caes Caesar shall forth; the things that threaten'd me, Ne're look'd but on my backe: When they shall see The face of Caesar, they are vanished Caesar, I neuer stood on Ceremonies, Yet now they fright me: There is one within, Besides the things that we haue heard and seene, Recounts most horrid sights seene by the Watch. A Lionnesse hath whelped in the streets, And Graues haue yawn'd, and yeelded vp their dead; Fierce fiery Warriours fight vpon the Clouds In Rankes and Squadrons, and right forme of Warre Which drizel'd blood vpon the Capitoll: The noise of Battell hurtled in the Ayre: Horsses do neigh, and dying men did grone, And Ghosts did shrieke and squeale about the streets. O Caesar, these things are beyond all vse, And I do feare them Caes What can be auoyded Whose end is purpos'd by the mighty Gods? Yet Caesar shall go forth: for these Predictions Are to the world in generall, as to Caesar When Beggers dye, there are no Comets seen, The Heauens themselues blaze forth the death of Princes Caes Cowards dye many times before their deaths, The valiant neuer taste of death but once: Of all the Wonders that I yet haue heard, It seemes to me most strange that men should feare, Seeing that death, a necessary end Will come, when it will come. What say the Augurers? They would not haue you to stirre forth to day. Plucking the intrailes of an Offering forth, They could not finde a heart within the beast Caes The Gods do this in shame of Cowardice: Caesar should be a Beast without a heart If he should stay at home to day for feare: No Caesar shall not; Danger knowes full well That Caesar is more dangerous then he. We heare two Lyons litter'd in one day, And I the elder and more terrible, And Caesar shall go foorth Alas my Lord, Your wisedome is consum'd in confidence: Do not go forth to day: Call it my feare, That keepes you in the house, and not your owne. Wee'l send Mark Antony to the Senate house, And he shall say, you are not well to day: Let me vpon my knee, preuaile in this Caes Mark Antony shall say I am not well, And for thy humor, I will stay at home. Heere's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so Caesar, all haile: Good morrow worthy Caesar, I come to fetch you to the Senate house Caes And you are come in very happy time, To beare my greeting to the Senators, And tell them that I will not come to day: Cannot, is false: and that I dare not, falser: I will not come to day, tell them so Decius Say he is sicke Caes Shall Caesar send a Lye? Haue I in Conquest stretcht mine Arme so farre, To be afear'd to tell Gray-beards the truth: Decius, go tell them, Caesar will not come Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause, Lest I be laught at when I tell them so Caes The cause is in my Will, I will not come, That is enough to satisfie the Senate. But for your priuate satisfaction, Because I loue you, I will let you know. Calphurnia heere my wife, stayes me at home: She dreampt to night, she saw my Statue, Which like a Fountaine, with an hundred spouts Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans Came smiling, & did bathe their hands in it: And these does she apply, for warnings and portents, And euils imminent; and on her knee Hath begg'd, that I will stay at home to day This Dreame is all amisse interpreted, It was a vision, faire and fortunate: Your Statue spouting blood in many pipes, In which so many smiling Romans bath'd, Signifies, that from you great Rome shall sucke Reuiuing blood, and that great men shall presse For Tinctures, Staines, Reliques, and Cognisance. This by Calphurnia's Dreame is signified Caes And this way haue you well expounded it I haue, when you haue heard what I can say: And know it now, the Senate haue concluded To giue this day, a Crowne to mighty Caesar. If you shall send them word you will not come, Their mindes may change. Besides, it were a mocke Apt to be render'd, for some one to say, Breake vp the Senate, till another time: When Caesars wife shall meete with better Dreames. If Caesar hide himselfe, shall they not whisper Loe Caesar is affraid? Pardon me Caesar, for my deere deere loue To your proceeding, bids me tell you this: And reason to my loue is liable Caes How foolish do your fears seeme now Calphurnia? I am ashamed I did yeeld to them. Giue me my Robe, for I will go. And looke where Publius is come to fetch me Good morrow Caesar Caes Welcome Publius. What Brutus, are you stirr'd so earely too? Good morrow Caska: Caius Ligarius, Caesar was ne're so much your enemy, As that same Ague which hath made you leane. What is't a Clocke? Caesar, 'tis strucken eight Caes I thanke you for your paines and curtesie. See, Antony that Reuels long a-nights Is notwithstanding vp. Good morrow Antony So to most Noble Caesar Caes Bid them prepare within: I am too blame to be thus waited for. Now Cynna, now Metellus: what Trebonius, I haue an houres talke in store for you: Remember that you call on me to day: Be neere me, that I may remember you Caesar I will: and so neere will I be, That your best Friends shall wish I had beene further Caes Good Friends go in, and taste some wine with me. And we (like Friends) will straight way go together That euery like is not the same, O Caesar, The heart of Brutus earnes to thinke vpon. Caesar, beware of Brutus, take heede of Cassius; come not neere Caska, haue an eye to Cynna, trust not Trebonius, marke well Metellus Cymber, Decius Brutus loues thee not: Thou hast wrong'd Caius Ligarius. There is but one minde in all these men, and it is bent against Caesar: If thou beest not Immortall, looke about you: Security giues way to Conspiracie. The mighty Gods defend thee. Thy Louer, Artemidorus. Heere will I stand, till Caesar passe along, And as a Sutor will I giue him this: My heart laments, that Vertue cannot liue Out of the teeth of Emulation. If thou reade this, O Caesar, thou mayest liue; If not, the Fates with Traitors do contriue. I prythee Boy, run to the Senate-house, Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone. Why doest thou stay? To know my errand Madam I would haue had thee there and heere agen Ere I can tell thee what thou should'st do there: O Constancie, be strong vpon my side, Set a huge Mountaine 'tweene my Heart and Tongue: I haue a mans minde, but a womans might: How hard it is for women to keepe counsell. Art thou heere yet? Madam, what should I do? Run to the Capitoll, and nothing else? And so returne to you, and nothing else? Yes, bring me word Boy, if thy Lord look well, For he went sickly forth: and take good note What Caesar doth, what Sutors presse to him. Hearke Boy, what noyse is that? I heare none Madam Prythee listen well: I heard a bussling Rumor like a Fray, And the winde brings it from the Capitoll Sooth Madam, I heare nothing. Come hither Fellow, which way hast thou bin? At mine owne house, good Lady What is't a clocke? About the ninth houre Lady Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitoll? Madam not yet, I go to take my stand, To see him passe on to the Capitoll Thou hast some suite to Caesar, hast thou not? That I haue Lady, if it will please Caesar To be so good to Caesar, as to heare me: I shall beseech him to befriend himselfe Why know'st thou any harme's intended towards him? None that I know will be, Much that I feare may chance: Good morrow to you: heere the street is narrow: The throng that followes Caesar at the heeles, Of Senators, of Praetors, common Sutors, Will crowd a feeble man (almost) to death: Ile get me to a place more voyd, and there Speake to great Caesar as he comes along. I must go in: Aye me! How weake a thing The heart of woman is? O Brutus, The Heauens speede thee in thine enterprize. Sure the Boy heard me: Brutus hath a suite That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint: Run Lucius, and commend me to my Lord, Say I am merry; Come to me againe, And bring me word what he doth say to thee. Cynna, Antony, Lepidus, Artimedorus, Publius, and the Soothsayer. Caes The Ides of March are come I Caesar, but not gone Haile Caesar: Read this Scedule Trebonius doth desire you to ore-read (At your best leysure) this his humble suite O Caesar, reade mine first: for mine's a suite That touches Caesar neerer. Read it great Caesar Caes What touches vs our selfe, shall be last seru'd Delay not Caesar, read it instantly Caes What, is the fellow mad? Sirra, giue place What, vrge you your Petitions in the street? Come to the Capitoll I wish your enterprize to day may thriue What enterprize Popillius? Fare you well What said Popillius Lena? He wisht to day our enterprize might thriue: I feare our purpose is discouered Looke how he makes to Caesar: marke him Caska be sodaine, for we feare preuention. Brutus what shall be done? If this be knowne, Cassius or Caesar neuer shall turne backe, For I will slay my selfe Cassius be constant: Popillius Lena speakes not of our purposes, For looke he smiles, and Caesar doth not change Trebonius knowes his time: for look you Brutus He drawes Mark Antony out of the way Where is Metellus Cimber, let him go, And presently preferre his suite to Caesar He is addrest: presse neere, and second him Caska, you are the first that reares your hand Caes Are we all ready? What is now amisse, That Caesar and his Senate must redresse? Most high, most mighty, and most puisant Caesar Metellus Cymber throwes before thy Seate An humble heart Caes I must preuent thee Cymber: These couchings, and these lowly courtesies Might fire the blood of ordinary men, And turne pre-Ordinance, and first Decree Into the lane of Children. Be not fond, To thinke that Caesar beares such Rebell blood That will be thaw'd from the true quality With that which melteth Fooles, I meane sweet words, Low-crooked-curtsies, and base Spaniell fawning: Thy Brother by decree is banished: If thou doest bend, and pray, and fawne for him, I spurne thee like a Curre out of my way: Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause Will he be satisfied Is there no voyce more worthy then my owne, To sound more sweetly in great Caesars eare, For the repealing of my banish'd Brother? I kisse thy hand, but not in flattery Caesar: Desiring thee, that Publius Cymber may Haue an immediate freedome of repeale Caes What Brutus? Pardon Caesar: Caesar pardon: As lowe as to thy foote doth Cassius fall, To begge infranchisement for Publius Cymber Caes I could be well mou'd, if I were as you, If I could pray to mooue, Prayers would mooue me: But I am constant as the Northerne Starre, Of whose true fixt, and resting quality, There is no fellow in the Firmament. The Skies are painted with vnnumbred sparkes, They are all Fire, and euery one doth shine: But, there's but one in all doth hold his place. So, in the World; 'Tis furnish'd well with Men, And Men are Flesh and Blood, and apprehensiue; Yet in the number, I do know but One That vnassayleable holds on his Ranke, Vnshak'd of Motion: and that I am he, Let me a little shew it, euen in this: That I was constant Cymber should be banish'd, And constant do remaine to keepe him so O Caesar Caes Hence: Wilt thou lift vp Olympus? Great Caesar Caes Doth not Brutus bootlesse kneele? Speake hands for me. They stab Caesar. Caes Et Tu Brute? - Then fall Caesar. Dyes Liberty, Freedome; Tyranny is dead, Run hence, proclaime, cry it about the Streets Some to the common Pulpits, and cry out Liberty, Freedome, and Enfranchisement People and Senators, be not affrighted: Fly not, stand still: Ambitions debt is paid Go to the Pulpit Brutus And Cassius too Where's Publius? Heere, quite confounded with this mutiny Stand fast together, least some Friend of Caesars Should chance- Talke not of standing. Publius good cheere, There is no harme intended to your person, Nor to no Roman else: so tell them Publius And leaue vs Publius, least that the people Rushing on vs, should do your Age some mischiefe Do so, and let no man abide this deede, But we the Doers. Where is Antony? Fled to his House amaz'd: Men, Wiues, and Children, stare, cry out, and run, As it were Doomesday Fates, we will know your pleasures: That we shall dye we know, 'tis but the time And drawing dayes out, that men stand vpon Why he that cuts off twenty yeares of life, Cuts off so many yeares of fearing death Grant that, and then is Death a Benefit: So are we Caesars Friends, that haue abridg'd His time of fearing death. Stoope Romans, stoope, And let vs bathe our hands in Caesars blood Vp to the Elbowes, and besmeare our Swords: Then walke we forth, euen to the Market place, And wauing our red Weapons o're our heads, Let's all cry Peace, Freedome, and Liberty Stoop then, and wash. How many Ages hence Shall this our lofty Scene be acted ouer, In State vnborne, and Accents yet vnknowne? How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport, That now on Pompeyes Basis lye along, No worthier then the dust? So oft as that shall be, So often shall the knot of vs be call'd, The Men that gaue their Country liberty What, shall we forth? I, euery man away. Brutus shall leade, and we will grace his heeles With the most boldest, and best hearts of Rome. Soft, who comes heere? A friend of Antonies Thus Brutus did my Master bid me kneele; Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall downe, And being prostrate, thus he bad me say: Brutus is Noble, Wise, Valiant, and Honest; Caesar was Mighty, Bold, Royall, and Louing: Say, I loue Brutus, and I honour him; Say, I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him, and lou'd him. If Brutus will vouchsafe, that Antony May safely come to him, and be resolu'd How Caesar hath deseru'd to lye in death, Mark Antony, shall not loue Caesar dead So well as Brutus liuing; but will follow The Fortunes and Affayres of Noble Brutus, Thorough the hazards of this vntrod State, With all true Faith. So sayes my Master Antony Thy Master is a Wise and Valiant Romane, I neuer thought him worse: Tell him, so please him come vnto this place He shall be satisfied: and by my Honor Depart vntouch'd Ile fetch him presently. I know that we shall haue him well to Friend I wish we may: But yet haue I a minde That feares him much: and my misgiuing still Falles shrewdly to the purpose. But heere comes Antony: Welcome Mark Antony O mighty Caesar! Dost thou lye so lowe? Are all thy Conquests, Glories, Triumphes, Spoiles, Shrunke to this little Measure? Fare thee well. I know not Gentlemen what you intend, Who else must be let blood, who else is ranke: If I my selfe, there is no houre so fit As Caesars deaths houre; nor no Instrument Of halfe that worth, as those your Swords; made rich With the most Noble blood of all this World. I do beseech yee, if you beare me hard, Now, whil'st your purpled hands do reeke and smoake, Fulfill your pleasure. Liue a thousand yeeres, I shall not finde my selfe so apt to dye. No place will please me so, no meane of death, As heere by Caesar, and by you cut off, The Choice and Master Spirits of this Age O Antony! Begge not your death of vs: Though now we must appeare bloody and cruell, As by our hands, and this our present Acte You see we do: Yet see you but our hands, And this, the bleeding businesse they haue done: Our hearts you see not, they are pittifull: And pitty to the generall wrong of Rome, As fire driues out fire, so pitty, pitty Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part, To you, our Swords haue leaden points Marke Antony: Our Armes in strength of malice, and our Hearts Of Brothers temper, do receiue you in, With all kinde loue, good thoughts, and reuerence Your voyce shall be as strong as any mans, In the disposing of new Dignities Onely be patient, till we haue appeas'd The Multitude, beside themselues with feare, And then, we will deliuer you the cause, Why I, that did loue Caesar when I strooke him, Haue thus proceeded I doubt not of your Wisedome: Let each man render me his bloody hand. First Marcus Brutus will I shake with you; Next Caius Cassius do I take your hand; Now Decius Brutus yours; now yours Metellus; Yours Cinna; and my valiant Caska, yours; Though last, not least in loue, yours good Trebonius. Gentlemen all: Alas, what shall I say, My credit now stands on such slippery ground, That one of two bad wayes you must conceit me, Either a Coward, or a Flatterer. That I did loue thee Caesar, O 'tis true: If then thy Spirit looke vpon vs now, Shall it not greeue thee deerer then thy death, To see thy Antony making his peace, Shaking the bloody fingers of thy Foes? Most Noble, in the presence of thy Coarse, Had I as many eyes, as thou hast wounds, Weeping as fast as they streame forth thy blood, It would become me better, then to close In tearmes of Friendship with thine enemies. Pardon me Iulius, heere was't thou bay'd braue Hart, Heere did'st thou fall, and heere thy Hunters stand Sign'd in thy Spoyle, and Crimson'd in thy Lethee. O World! thou wast the Forrest to this Hart, And this indeed, O World, the Hart of thee. How like a Deere, stroken by many Princes, Dost thou heere lye? Mark Antony Pardon me Caius Cassius: The Enemies of Caesar, shall say this: Then, in a Friend, it is cold Modestie I blame you not for praising Caesar so. But what compact meane you to haue with vs? Will you be prick'd in number of our Friends, Or shall we on, and not depend on you? Therefore I tooke your hands, but was indeed Sway'd from the point, by looking downe on Caesar. Friends am I with you all, and loue you all, Vpon this hope, that you shall giue me Reasons, Why, and wherein, Caesar was dangerous Or else were this a sauage Spectacle: Our Reasons are so full of good regard, That were you Antony, the Sonne of Caesar, You should be satisfied That's all I seeke, And am moreouer sutor, that I may Produce his body to the Market-place, And in the Pulpit as becomes a Friend, Speake in the Order of his Funerall You shall Marke Antony Brutus, a word with you: You know not what you do; Do not consent That Antony speake in his Funerall: Know you how much the people may be mou'd By that which he will vtter By your pardon: I will my selfe into the Pulpit first, And shew the reason of our Caesars death. What Antony shall speake, I will protest He speakes by leaue, and by permission: And that we are contented Caesar shall Haue all true Rites, and lawfull Ceremonies, It shall aduantage more, then do vs wrong I know not what may fall, I like it not Mark Antony, heere take you Caesars body: You shall not in your Funerall speech blame vs, But speake all good you can deuise of Caesar, And say you doo't by our permission: Else shall you not haue any hand at all About his Funerall. And you shall speake In the same Pulpit whereto I am going, After my speech is ended Be it so: I do desire no more Prepare the body then, and follow vs. Manet Antony. O pardon me, thou bleeding peece of Earth: That I am meeke and gentle with these Butchers. Thou art the Ruines of the Noblest man That euer liued in the Tide of Times. Woe to the hand that shed this costly Blood. Ouer thy wounds, now do I Prophesie, (Which like dumbe mouthes do ope their Ruby lips, To begge the voyce and vtterance of my Tongue) A Curse shall light vpon the limbes of men; Domesticke Fury, and fierce Ciuill strife, Shall cumber all the parts of Italy: Blood and destruction shall be so in vse, And dreadfull Obiects so familiar, That Mothers shall but smile, when they behold Their Infants quartered with the hands of Warre: All pitty choak'd with custome of fell deeds, And Caesars Spirit ranging for Reuenge, With Ate by his side, come hot from Hell, Shall in these Confines, with a Monarkes voyce, Cry hauocke, and let slip the Dogges of Warre, That this foule deede, shall smell aboue the earth With Carrion men, groaning for Buriall. You serue Octauius Caesar, do you not? I do Marke Antony Caesar did write for him to come to Rome He did receiue his Letters, and is comming, And bid me say to you by word of mouth- O Caesar! Thy heart is bigge: get thee a-part and weepe: Passion I see is catching from mine eyes, Seeing those Beads of sorrow stand in thine, Began to water. Is thy Master comming? He lies to night within seuen Leagues of Rome Post backe with speede, And tell him what hath chanc'd: Heere is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome, No Rome of safety for Octauius yet, Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet stay a-while, Thou shalt not backe, till I haue borne this course Into the Market place: There shall I try In my Oration, how the People take The cruell issue of these bloody men, According to the which, thou shalt discourse To yong Octauius, of the state of things. Lend me your hand. We will be satisfied: let vs be satisfied Then follow me, and giue me Audience friends. Cassius go you into the other streete, And part the Numbers: Those that will heare me speake, let 'em stay heere; Those that will follow Cassius, go with him, And publike Reasons shall be rendred Of Caesars death 1.Ple. I will heare Brutus speake 2. I will heare Cassius, and compare their Reasons, When seuerally we heare them rendred 3. The Noble Brutus is ascended: Silence Be patient till the last. Romans, Countrey-men, and Louers, heare mee for my cause, and be silent, that you may heare. Beleeue me for mine Honor, and haue respect to mine Honor, that you may beleeue. Censure me in your Wisedom, and awake your Senses, that you may the better Iudge. If there bee any in this Assembly, any deere Friend of Caesars, to him I say, that Brutus loue to Caesar, was no lesse then his. If then, that Friend demand, why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer: Not that I lou'd Caesar lesse, but that I lou'd Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were liuing, and dye all Slaues; then that Caesar were dead, to liue all Free-men? As Caesar lou'd mee, I weepe for him; as he was Fortunate, I reioyce at it; as he was Valiant, I honour him: But, as he was Ambitious, I slew him. There is Teares, for his Loue: Ioy, for his Fortune: Honor, for his Valour: and Death, for his Ambition. Who is heere so base, that would be a Bondman? If any, speak, for him haue I offended. Who is heere so rude, that would not be a Roman? If any, speak, for him haue I offended. Who is heere so vile, that will not loue his Countrey? If any, speake, for him haue I offended. I pause for a Reply None Brutus, none Then none haue I offended. I haue done no more to Caesar, then you shall do to Brutus. The Question of his death, is inroll'd in the Capitoll: his Glory not extenuated, wherein he was worthy; nor his offences enforc'd, for which he suffered death. Heere comes his Body, mourn'd by Marke Antony, who though he had no hand in his death, shall receiue the benefit of his dying, a place in the Comonwealth, as which of you shall not. With this I depart, that as I slewe my best Louer for the good of Rome, I haue the same Dagger for my selfe, when it shall please my Country to need my death Liue Brutus, liue, liue 1. Bring him with Triumph home vnto his house 2. Giue him a Statue with his Ancestors 3. Let him be Caesar 4. Caesars better parts, Shall be Crown'd in Brutus 1. Wee'l bring him to his House, With Showts and Clamors My Country-men 2. Peace, silence, Brutus speakes 1. Peace ho Good Countrymen, let me depart alone, And (for my sake) stay heere with Antony: Do grace to Caesars Corpes, and grace his Speech Tending to Caesars Glories, which Marke Antony (By our permission) is allow'd to make. I do intreat you, not a man depart, Saue I alone, till Antony haue spoke. 1 Stay ho, and let vs heare Mark Antony 3 Let him go vp into the publike Chaire, Wee'l heare him: Noble Antony go vp For Brutus sake, I am beholding to you 4 What does he say of Brutus? 3 He sayes, for Brutus sake He findes himselfe beholding to vs all 4 'Twere best he speake no harme of Brutus heere? 1 This Caesar was a Tyrant 3 Nay that's certaine: We are blest that Rome is rid of him 2 Peace, let vs heare what Antony can say You gentle Romans Peace hoe, let vs heare him Friends, Romans, Countrymen, lend me your ears: I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him: The euill that men do, liues after them, The good is oft enterred with their bones, So let it be with Caesar. The Noble Brutus, Hath told you Caesar was Ambitious: If it were so, it was a greeuous Fault, And greeuously hath Caesar answer'd it. Heere, vnder leaue of Brutus, and the rest (For Brutus is an Honourable man, So are they all; all Honourable men) Come I to speake in Caesars Funerall. He was my Friend, faithfull, and iust to me; But Brutus sayes, he was Ambitious, And Brutus is an Honourable man. He hath brought many Captiues home to Rome, Whose Ransomes, did the generall Coffers fill: Did this in Caesar seeme Ambitious? When that the poore haue cry'de, Caesar hath wept: Ambition should be made of sterner stuffe, Yet Brutus sayes, he was Ambitious: And Brutus is an Honourable man. You all did see, that on the Lupercall, I thrice presented him a Kingly Crowne, Which he did thrice refuse. Was this Ambition? Yet Brutus sayes, he was Ambitious: And sure he is an Honourable man. I speake not to disprooue what Brutus spoke, But heere I am, to speake what I do know; You all did loue him once, not without cause, What cause with-holds you then, to mourne for him? O Iudgement! thou are fled to brutish Beasts, And Men haue lost their Reason. Beare with me, My heart is in the Coffin there with Caesar, And I must pawse, till it come backe to me 1 Me thinkes there is much reason in his sayings 2 If thou consider rightly of the matter, Caesar ha's had great wrong 3 Ha's hee Masters? I feare there will a worse come in his place 4. Mark'd ye his words? he would not take y Crown, Therefore 'tis certaine, he was not Ambitious 1. If it be found so, some will deere abide it 2. Poore soule, his eyes are red as fire with weeping 3. There's not a Nobler man in Rome then Antony 4. Now marke him, he begins againe to speake But yesterday, the word of Caesar might Haue stood against the World: Now lies he there, And none so poore to do him reuerence. O Maisters! If I were dispos'd to stirre Your hearts and mindes to Mutiny and Rage, I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong: Who (you all know) are Honourable men. I will not do them wrong: I rather choose To wrong the dead, to wrong my selfe and you, Then I will wrong such Honourable men. But heere's a Parchment, with the Seale of Caesar, I found it in his Closset, 'tis his Will: Let but the Commons heare this Testament: (Which pardon me) I do not meane to reade, And they would go and kisse dead Caesars wounds, And dip their Napkins in his Sacred Blood; Yea, begge a haire of him for Memory, And dying, mention it within their Willes, Bequeathing it as a rich Legacie Vnto their issue 4 Wee'l heare the Will, reade it Marke Antony The Will, the Will; we will heare Caesars Will Haue patience gentle Friends, I must not read it. It is not meete you know how Caesar lou'd you: You are not Wood, you are not Stones, but men: And being men, hearing the Will of Caesar, It will inflame you, it will make you mad: 'Tis good you know not that you are his Heires, For if you should, O what would come of it? 4 Read the Will, wee'l heare it Antony: You shall reade vs the Will, Caesars Will Will you be Patient? Will you stay a-while? I haue o're-shot my selfe to tell you of it, I feare I wrong the Honourable men, Whose Daggers haue stabb'd Caesar: I do feare it 4 They were Traitors: Honourable men? The Will, the Testament 2 They were Villaines, Murderers: the Will, read the Will You will compell me then to read the Will: Then make a Ring about the Corpes of Caesar, And let me shew you him that made the Will: Shall I descend? And will you giue me leaue? Come downe 2 Descend 3 You shall haue leaue 4 A Ring, stand round 1 Stand from the Hearse, stand from the Body 2 Roome for Antony, most Noble Antony Nay presse not so vpon me, stand farre off Stand backe: roome, beare backe If you haue teares, prepare to shed them now. You all do know this Mantle, I remember The first time euer Caesar put it on, 'Twas on a Summers Euening in his Tent, That day he ouercame the Neruij. Looke, in this place ran Cassius Dagger through: See what a rent the enuious Caska made: Through this, the wel-beloued Brutus stabb'd, And as he pluck'd his cursed Steele away: Marke how the blood of Caesar followed it, As rushing out of doores, to be resolu'd If Brutus so vnkindely knock'd, or no: For Brutus, as you know, was Caesars Angel. Iudge, O you Gods, how deerely Caesar lou'd him: This was the most vnkindest cut of all. For when the Noble Caesar saw him stab, Ingratitude, more strong then Traitors armes, Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his Mighty heart, And in his Mantle, muffling vp his face, Euen at the Base of Pompeyes Statue (Which all the while ran blood) great Caesar fell. O what a fall was there, my Countrymen? Then I, and you, and all of vs fell downe, Whil'st bloody Treason flourish'd ouer vs. O now you weepe, and I perceiue you feele The dint of pitty: These are gracious droppes. Kinde Soules, what weepe you, when you but behold Our Caesars Vesture wounded? Looke you heere, Heere is Himselfe, marr'd as you see with Traitors 1. O pitteous spectacle! 2. O Noble Caesar! 3. O wofull day! 4. O Traitors, Villaines! 1. O most bloody sight! 2. We will be reueng'd: Reuenge About, seeke, burne, fire, kill, slay, Let not a Traitor liue Stay Country-men 1. Peace there, heare the Noble Antony 2. Wee'l heare him, wee'l follow him, wee'l dy with him Good Friends, sweet Friends, let me not stirre you vp To such a sodaine Flood of Mutiny: They that haue done this Deede, are honourable. What priuate greefes they haue, alas I know not, That made them do it: They are Wise, and Honourable, And will no doubt with Reasons answer you. I come not (Friends) to steale away your hearts, I am no Orator, as Brutus is: But (as you know me all) a plaine blunt man That loue my Friend, and that they know full well, That gaue me publike leaue to speake of him: For I haue neyther writ nor words, nor worth, Action, nor Vtterance, nor the power of Speech, To stirre mens Blood. I onely speake right on: I tell you that, which you your selues do know, Shew you sweet Caesars wounds, poor poor dum mouths And bid them speake for me: But were I Brutus, And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony Would ruffle vp your Spirits, and put a Tongue In euery Wound of Caesar, that should moue The stones of Rome, to rise and Mutiny Wee'l Mutiny 1 Wee'l burne the house of Brutus 3 Away then, come, seeke the Conspirators Yet heare me Countrymen, yet heare me speake Peace hoe, heare Antony, most Noble Antony Why Friends, you go to do you know not what: Wherein hath Caesar thus deseru'd your loues? Alas you know not, I must tell you then: You haue forgot the Will I told you of Most true, the Will, let's stay and heare the Wil Heere is the Will, and vnder Caesars Seale: To euery Roman Citizen he giues, To euery seuerall man, seuenty fiue Drachmaes 2 Ple. Most Noble Caesar, wee'l reuenge his death 3 Ple. O Royall Caesar Heare me with patience Peace hoe Moreouer, he hath left you all his Walkes, His priuate Arbors, and new-planted Orchards, On this side Tyber, he hath left them you, And to your heyres for euer: common pleasures To walke abroad, and recreate your selues. Heere was a Caesar: when comes such another? 1.Ple. Neuer, neuer: come, away, away: Wee'l burne his body in the holy place, And with the Brands fire the Traitors houses. Take vp the body 2.Ple. Go fetch fire 3.Ple. Plucke downe Benches 4.Ple. Plucke downe Formes, Windowes, any thing. Now let it worke: Mischeefe thou art a-foot, Take thou what course thou wilt. How now Fellow? Sir, Octauius is already come to Rome Where is hee? He and Lepidus are at Caesars house And thither will I straight, to visit him: He comes vpon a wish. Fortune is merry, And in this mood will giue vs any thing I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius Are rid like Madmen through the Gates of Rome Belike they had some notice of the people How I had moued them. Bring me to Octauius. I dreamt to night, that I did feast with Caesar, And things vnluckily charge my Fantasie: I haue no will to wander foorth of doores, Yet something leads me foorth 1. What is your name? 2. Whether are you going? 3. Where do you dwell? 4. Are you a married man, or a Batchellor? 2. Answer euery man directly 1. I, and breefely 4. I, and wisely 3. I, and truly, you were best What is my name? Whether am I going? Where do I dwell? Am I a married man, or a Batchellour? Then to answer euery man, directly and breefely, wisely and truly: wisely I say, I am a Batchellor 2 That's as much as to say, they are fooles that marrie: you'l beare me a bang for that I feare: proceede directly Directly I am going to Caesars Funerall 1. As a Friend, or an Enemy? As a friend 2. That matter is answered directly 4. For your dwelling: breefely Breefely, I dwell by the Capitoll 3. Your name sir, truly Truly, my name is Cinna 1. Teare him to peeces, hee's a Conspirator I am Cinna the Poet, I am Cinna the Poet 4. Teare him for his bad verses, teare him for his bad Verses I am not Cinna the Conspirator 4. It is no matter, his name's Cinna, plucke but his name out of his heart, and turne him going 3. Teare him, tear him; Come Brands hoe, Firebrands: to Brutus, to Cassius, burne all. Some to Decius House, and some to Caska's; some to Ligarius: Away, go. These many then shall die, their names are prickt Your Brother too must dye: consent you Lepidus? I do consent Pricke him downe Antony Vpon condition Publius shall not liue, Who is your Sisters sonne, Marke Antony He shall not liue; looke, with a spot I dam him. But Lepidus, go you to Caesars house: Fetch the Will hither, and we shall determine How to cut off some charge in Legacies What? shall I finde you heere? Or heere, or at the Capitoll. This is a slight vnmeritable man, Meet to be sent on Errands: is it fit The three-fold World diuided, he should stand One of the three to share it? So you thought him, And tooke his voyce who should be prickt to dye In our blacke Sentence and Proscription Octauius, I haue seene more dayes then you, And though we lay these Honours on this man, To ease our selues of diuers sland'rous loads, He shall but beare them, as the Asse beares Gold, To groane and swet vnder the Businesse, Either led or driuen, as we point the way: And hauing brought our Treasure, where we will, Then take we downe his Load, and turne him off (Like to the empty Asse) to shake his eares, And graze in Commons You may do your will: But hee's a tried, and valiant Souldier So is my Horse Octauius, and for that I do appoint him store of Prouender. It is a Creature that I teach to fight, To winde, to stop, to run directly on: His corporall Motion, gouern'd by my Spirit, And in some taste, is Lepidus but so: He must be taught, and train'd, and bid go forth: A barren spirited Fellow; one that feeds On Obiects, Arts, and Imitations. Which out of vse, and stal'de by other men Begin his fashion. Do not talke of him, But as a property: and now Octauius, Listen great things. Brutus and Cassius Are leuying Powers; We must straight make head: Therefore let our Alliance be combin'd, Our best Friends made, our meanes stretcht, And let vs presently go sit in Councell, How couert matters may be best disclos'd, And open Perils surest answered Let vs do so: for we are at the stake, And bayed about with many Enemies, And some that smile haue in their hearts I feare Millions of Mischeefes. Enter Brutus, Lucillius, and the Army. Titinius and Pindarus meete them. Stand ho Giue the word ho, and Stand What now Lucillius, is Cassius neere? He is at hand, and Pindarus is come To do you salutation from his Master He greets me well. Your Master Pindarus In his owne change, or by ill Officers, Hath giuen me some worthy cause to wish Things done, vndone: But if he be at hand I shall be satisfied I do not doubt But that my Noble Master will appeare Such as he is, full of regard, and Honour He is not doubted. A word Lucillius How he receiu'd you: let me be resolu'd With courtesie, and with respect enough, But not with such familiar instances, Nor with such free and friendly Conference As he hath vs'd of old Thou hast describ'd A hot Friend, cooling: Euer note Lucillius, When Loue begins to sicken and decay It vseth an enforced Ceremony. There are no trickes, in plaine and simple Faith: But hollow men, like Horses hot at hand, Make gallant shew, and promise of their Mettle: Low March within. But when they should endure the bloody Spurre, They fall their Crests, and like deceitfull Iades Sinke in the Triall. Comes his Army on? They meane this night in Sardis to be quarter'd: The greater part, the Horse in generall Are come with Cassius. Hearke, he is arriu'd: March gently on to meete him Stand ho Stand ho, speake the word along. Stand Most Noble Brother, you haue done me wrong Iudge me you Gods; wrong I mine Enemies? And if not so, how should I wrong a Brother Brutus, this sober forme of yours, hides wrongs, And when you do them- Cassius, be content, Speake your greefes softly, I do know you well. Before the eyes of both our Armies heere (Which should perceiue nothing but Loue from vs) Let vs not wrangle. Bid them moue away: Then in my Tent Cassius enlarge your Greefes, And I will giue you Audience Pindarus, Bid our Commanders leade their Charges off A little from this ground Lucillius, do you the like, and let no man Come to our Tent, till we haue done our Conference. Let Lucius and Titinius guard our doore. Manet Brutus and Cassius. That you haue wrong'd me, doth appear in this: You haue condemn'd, and noted Lucius Pella For taking Bribes heere of the Sardians; Wherein my Letters, praying on his side, Because I knew the man was slighted off You wrong'd your selfe to write in such a case In such a time as this, it is not meet That euery nice offence should beare his Comment Let me tell you Cassius, you your selfe Are much condemn'd to haue an itching Palme, To sell, and Mart your Offices for Gold To Vndeseruers I, an itching Palme? You know that you are Brutus that speakes this, Or by the Gods, this speech were else your last The name of Cassius Honors this corruption, And Chasticement doth therefore hide his head Chasticement? Remember March, the Ides of March remeber: Did not great Iulius bleede for Iustice sake? What Villaine touch'd his body, that did stab, And not for Iustice? What? Shall one of Vs, That strucke the Formost man of all this World, But for supporting Robbers: shall we now, Contaminate our fingers, with base Bribes? And sell the mighty space of our large Honors For so much trash, as may be grasped thus? I had rather be a Dogge, and bay the Moone, Then such a Roman Brutus, baite not me, Ile not indure it: you forget your selfe To hedge me in. I am a Souldier, I, Older in practice, Abler then your selfe To make Conditions Go too: you are not Cassius I am I say, you are not Vrge me no more, I shall forget my selfe: Haue minde vpon your health: Tempt me no farther Away slight man Is't possible? Heare me, for I will speake. Must I giue way, and roome to your rash Choller? Shall I be frighted, when a Madman stares? O ye Gods, ye Gods, Must I endure all this? All this? I more: Fret till your proud hart break. Go shew your Slaues how Chollericke you are, And make your Bondmen tremble. Must I bouge? Must I obserue you? Must I stand and crouch Vnder your Testie Humour? By the Gods, You shall digest the Venom of your Spleene Though it do Split you. For, from this day forth, Ile vse you for my Mirth, yea for my Laughter When you are Waspish Is it come to this? You say, you are a better Souldier: Let it appeare so; make your vaunting true, And it shall please me well. For mine owne part, I shall be glad to learne of Noble men You wrong me euery way: You wrong me Brutus: I saide, an Elder Souldier, not a Better. Did I say Better? If you did, I care not When Caesar liu'd, he durst not thus haue mou'd me Peace, peace, you durst not so haue tempted him I durst not No What? durst not tempt him? For your life you durst not Do not presume too much vpon my Loue, I may do that I shall be sorry for You haue done that you should be sorry for. There is no terror Cassius in your threats: For I am Arm'd so strong in Honesty, That they passe by me, as the idle winde, Which I respect not. I did send to you For certaine summes of Gold, which you deny'd me, For I can raise no money by vile meanes: By Heauen, I had rather Coine my Heart, And drop my blood for Drachmaes, then to wring From the hard hands of Peazants, their vile trash By any indirection. I did send To you for Gold to pay my Legions, Which you deny'd me: was that done like Cassius? Should I haue answer'd Caius Cassius so? When Marcus Brutus growes so Couetous, To locke such Rascall Counters from his Friends, Be ready Gods with all your Thunder-bolts, Dash him to peeces I deny'd you not You did I did not. He was but a Foole That brought my answer back. Brutus hath riu'd my hart: A Friend should beare his Friends infirmities; But Brutus makes mine greater then they are I do not, till you practice them on me You loue me not I do not like your faults A friendly eye could neuer see such faults A Flatterers would not, though they do appeare As huge as high Olympus Come Antony, and yong Octauius come, Reuenge your selues alone on Cassius, For Cassius is a-weary of the World: Hated by one he loues, brau'd by his Brother, Check'd like a bondman, all his faults obseru'd, Set in a Note-booke, learn'd, and con'd by roate To cast into my Teeth. O I could weepe My Spirit from mine eyes. There is my Dagger, And heere my naked Breast: Within, a Heart Deerer then Pluto's Mine, Richer then Gold: If that thou bee'st a Roman, take it foorth. I that deny'd thee Gold, will giue my Heart: Strike as thou did'st at Caesar: For I know, When thou did'st hate him worst, y loued'st him better Then euer thou loued'st Cassius Sheath your Dagger: Be angry when you will, it shall haue scope: Do what you will, Dishonor, shall be Humour. O Cassius, you are yoaked with a Lambe That carries Anger, as the Flint beares fire, Who much inforced, shewes a hastie Sparke, And straite is cold agen Hath Cassius liu'd To be but Mirth and Laughter to his Brutus, When greefe and blood ill temper'd, vexeth him? When I spoke that, I was ill temper'd too Do you confesse so much? Giue me your hand And my heart too O Brutus! What's the matter? Haue not you loue enough to beare with me, When that rash humour which my Mother gaue me Makes me forgetfull Yes Cassius, and from henceforth When you are ouer-earnest with your Brutus, Hee'l thinke your Mother chides, and leaue you so. Let me go in to see the Generals, There is some grudge betweene 'em, 'tis not meete They be alone You shall not come to them Nothing but death shall stay me How now? What's the matter? For shame you Generals; what do you meane? Loue, and be Friends, as two such men should bee, For I haue seene more yeeres I'me sure then yee Ha, ha, how vildely doth this Cynicke rime? Get you hence sirra: Sawcy Fellow, hence Beare with him Brutus, 'tis his fashion Ile know his humor, when he knowes his time: What should the Warres do with these Iigging Fooles? Companion, hence Away, away be gone. Lucillius and Titinius bid the Commanders Prepare to lodge their Companies to night And come your selues, & bring Messala with you Immediately to vs Lucius, a bowle of Wine I did not thinke you could haue bin so angry O Cassius, I am sicke of many greefes Of your Philosophy you make no vse, If you giue place to accidentall euils No man beares sorrow better. Portia is dead Ha? Portia? She is dead How scap'd I killing, when I crost you so? O insupportable, and touching losse! Vpon what sicknesse? Impatient of my absence, And greefe, that yong Octauius with Mark Antony Haue made themselues so strong: For with her death That tydings came. With this she fell distract, And (her Attendants absent) swallow'd fire And dy'd so? Euen so O ye immortall Gods! Speak no more of her: Giue me a bowl of wine, In this I bury all vnkindnesse Cassius. Drinkes My heart is thirsty for that Noble pledge. Fill Lucius, till the Wine ore-swell the Cup: I cannot drinke too much of Brutus loue. Come in Titinius: Welcome good Messala: Now sit we close about this Taper heere, And call in question our necessities Portia, art thou gone? No more I pray you. Messala, I haue heere receiued Letters, That yong Octauius, and Marke Antony Come downe vpon vs with a mighty power, Bending their Expedition toward Philippi My selfe haue Letters of the selfe-same Tenure With what Addition That by proscription, and billes of Outlarie, Octauius, Antony, and Lepidus, Haue put to death, an hundred Senators Therein our Letters do not well agree: Mine speake of seuenty Senators, that dy'de By their proscriptions, Cicero being one Cicero one? Cicero is dead, and by that order of proscription Had you your Letters from your wife, my Lord? No Messala Nor nothing in your Letters writ of her? Nothing Messala That me thinkes is strange Why aske you? Heare you ought of her, in yours? No my Lord Now as you are a Roman tell me true Then like a Roman, beare the truth I tell, For certaine she is dead, and by strange manner Why farewell Portia: We must die Messala: With meditating that she must dye once, I haue the patience to endure it now Euen so great men, great losses shold indure I haue as much of this in Art as you, But yet my Nature could not beare it so Well, to our worke aliue. What do you thinke Of marching to Philippi presently I do not thinke it good Your reason? This it is: 'Tis better that the Enemie seeke vs, So shall he waste his meanes, weary his Souldiers, Doing himselfe offence, whil'st we lying still, Are full of rest, defence, and nimblenesse Good reasons must of force giue place to better: The people 'twixt Philippi, and this ground Do stand but in a forc'd affection: For they haue grug'd vs Contribution. The Enemy, marching along by them, By them shall make a fuller number vp, Come on refresht, new added, and encourag'd: From which aduantage shall we cut him off. If at Philippi we do face him there, These people at our backe Heare me good Brother Vnder your pardon. You must note beside, That we haue tride the vtmost of our Friends: Our Legions are brim full, our cause is ripe, The Enemy encreaseth euery day, We at the height, are readie to decline. There is a Tide in the affayres of men, Which taken at the Flood, leades on to Fortune: Omitted, all the voyage of their life, Is bound in Shallowes, and in Miseries. On such a full Sea are we now a-float, And we must take the current when it serues, Or loose our Ventures Then with your will go on: wee'l along Our selues, and meet them at Philippi The deepe of night is crept vpon our talke, And Nature must obey Necessitie, Which we will niggard with a little rest: There is no more to say No more, good night, Early to morrow will we rise, and hence. Lucius my Gowne: farewell good Messala, Good night Titinius: Noble, Noble Cassius, Good night, and good repose O my deere Brother: This was an ill beginning of the night: Neuer come such diuision 'tweene our soules: Let it not Brutus. Euery thing is well Good night my Lord Good night good Brother Messa. Good night Lord Brutus Farwell euery one. Giue me the Gowne. Where is thy Instrument? Heere in the Tent What, thou speak'st drowsily? Poore knaue I blame thee not, thou art ore-watch'd. Call Claudio, and some other of my men, Ile haue them sleepe on Cushions in my Tent Varrus, and Claudio. Cals my Lord? I pray you sirs, lye in my Tent and sleepe, It may be I shall raise you by and by On businesse to my Brother Cassius So please you, we will stand, And watch your pleasure I will it not haue it so: Lye downe good sirs, It may be I shall otherwise bethinke me. Looke Lucius, heere's the booke I sought for so: I put it in the pocket of my Gowne I was sure your Lordship did not giue it me Beare with me good Boy, I am much forgetfull. Canst thou hold vp thy heauie eyes a-while, And touch thy Instrument a straine or two I my Lord, an't please you It does my Boy: I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing It is my duty Sir I should not vrge thy duty past thy might, I know yong bloods looke for a time of rest I haue slept my Lord already It was well done, and thou shalt sleepe againe: I will not hold thee long. If I do liue, I will be good to thee. Musicke, and a Song. This is a sleepy Tune: O Murd'rous slumber! Layest thou thy Leaden Mace vpon my Boy, That playes thee Musicke? Gentle knaue good night: I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee: If thou do'st nod, thou break'st thy Instrument, Ile take it from thee, and (good Boy) good night. Let me see, let me see; is not the Leafe turn'd downe Where I left reading? Heere it is I thinke. How ill this Taper burnes. Ha! Who comes heere? I thinke it is the weakenesse of mine eyes That shapes this monstrous Apparition. It comes vpon me: Art thou any thing? Art thou some God, some Angell, or some Diuell, That mak'st my blood cold, and my haire to stare? Speake to me, what thou art Thy euill Spirit Brutus? Why com'st thou? To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi Well: then I shall see thee againe? I, at Philippi Why I will see thee at Philippi then: Now I haue taken heart, thou vanishest. Ill Spirit, I would hold more talke with thee. Boy, Lucius, Varrus, Claudio, Sirs: Awake: Claudio The strings my Lord, are false He thinkes he still is at his Instrument. Lucius, awake My Lord Did'st thou dreame Lucius, that thou so cryedst out? My Lord, I do not know that I did cry Yes that thou did'st: Did'st thou see any thing? Nothing my Lord Sleepe againe Lucius: Sirra Claudio, Fellow, Thou: Awake My Lord My Lord Why did you so cry out sirs, in your sleepe? Did we my Lord? I: saw you any thing? No my Lord, I saw nothing Nor I my Lord Go, and commend me to my Brother Cassius: Bid him set on his Powres betimes before, And we will follow It shall be done my Lord. Now Antony, our hopes are answered, You said the Enemy would not come downe, But keepe the Hilles and vpper Regions: It proues not so: their battailes are at hand, They meane to warne vs at Philippi heere: Answering before we do demand of them Tut I am in their bosomes, and I know Wherefore they do it: They could be content To visit other places, and come downe With fearefull brauery: thinking by this face To fasten in our thoughts that they haue Courage; But 'tis not so. Prepare you Generals, The Enemy comes on in gallant shew: Their bloody signe of Battell is hung out, And something to be done immediately Octauius, leade your Battaile softly on Vpon the left hand of the euen Field Vpon the right hand I, keepe thou the left Why do you crosse me in this exigent I do not crosse you: but I will do so. Enter Brutus, Cassius, & their Army. They stand, and would haue parley Stand fast Titinius, we must out and talke Mark Antony, shall we giue signe of Battaile? No Caesar, we will answer on their Charge. Make forth, the Generals would haue some words Stirre not vntill the Signall Words before blowes: is it so Countrymen? Not that we loue words better, as you do Good words are better then bad strokes Octauius In your bad strokes Brutus, you giue good words Witnesse the hole you made in Caesars heart, Crying long liue, Haile Caesar Antony, The posture of your blowes are yet vnknowne; But for your words, they rob the Hibla Bees, And leaue them Hony-lesse Not stinglesse too O yes, and soundlesse too: For you haue stolne their buzzing Antony, And very wisely threat before you sting Villains: you did not so, when your vile daggers Hackt one another in the sides of Caesar: You shew'd your teethes like Apes, And fawn'd like Hounds, And bow'd like Bondmen, kissing Caesars feete; Whil'st damned Caska, like a Curre, behinde Strooke Caesar on the necke. O you Flatterers Flatterers? Now Brutus thanke your selfe, This tongue had not offended so to day. If Cassius might haue rul'd Come, come, the cause. If arguing make vs swet, The proofe of it will turne to redder drops: Looke, I draw a Sword against Conspirators, When thinke you that the Sword goes vp againe? Neuer till Caesars three and thirtie wounds Be well aueng'd; or till another Caesar Haue added slaughter to the Sword of Traitors Caesar, thou canst not dye by Traitors hands. Vnlesse thou bring'st them with thee So I hope: I was not borne to dye on Brutus Sword O if thou wer't the Noblest of thy Straine, Yong-man, thou could'st not dye more honourable A peeuish School-boy, worthles of such Honor Ioyn'd with a Masker, and a Reueller Old Cassius still Come Antony: away: Defiance Traitors, hurle we in your teeth. If you dare fight to day, come to the Field; If not, when you haue stomackes. Why now blow winde, swell Billow, And swimme Barke: The Storme is vp, and all is on the hazard Ho Lucillius, hearke, a word with you. Lucillius and Messala stand forth. My Lord Messala What sayes my Generall? Messala, this is my Birth-day: at this very day Was Cassius borne. Giue me thy hand Messala: Be thou my witnesse, that against my will (As Pompey was) am I compell'd to set Vpon one Battell all our Liberties. You know, that I held Epicurus strong, And his Opinion: Now I change my minde, And partly credit things that do presage. Comming from Sardis, on our former Ensigne Two mighty Eagles fell, and there they pearch'd, Gorging and feeding from our Soldiers hands, Who to Philippi heere consorted vs: This Morning are they fled away, and gone, And in their steeds, do Rauens, Crowes, and Kites Fly ore our heads, and downward looke on vs As we were sickely prey; their shadowes seeme A Canopy most fatall, vnder which Our Army lies, ready to giue vp the Ghost Beleeue not so I but beleeue it partly, For I am fresh of spirit, and resolu'd To meete all perils, very constantly Euen so Lucillius Now most Noble Brutus, The Gods to day stand friendly, that we may Louers in peace, leade on our dayes to age. But since the affayres of men rests still incertaine, Let's reason with the worst that may befall. If we do lose this Battaile, then is this The very last time we shall speake together: What are you then determined to do? Euen by the rule of that Philosophy, By which I did blame Cato, for the death Which he did giue himselfe, I know not how: But I do finde it Cowardly, and vile, For feare of what might fall, so to preuent The time of life, arming my selfe with patience, To stay the prouidence of some high Powers, That gouerne vs below Then, if we loose this Battaile, You are contented to be led in Triumph Thorow the streets of Rome No Cassius, no: Thinke not thou Noble Romane, That euer Brutus will go bound to Rome, He beares too great a minde. But this same day Must end that worke, the Ides of March begun. And whether we shall meete againe, I know not: Therefore our euerlasting farewell take: For euer, and for euer, farewell Cassius, If we do meete againe, why we shall smile; If not, why then this parting was well made For euer, and for euer, farewell Brutus: If we do meete againe, wee'l smile indeede; If not, 'tis true, this parting was well made Why then leade on. O that a man might know The end of this dayes businesse, ere it come: But it sufficeth, that the day will end, And then the end is knowne. Come ho, away. Ride, ride Messala, ride and giue these Billes Vnto the Legions, on the other side. Lowd Alarum. Let them set on at once: for I perceiue But cold demeanor in Octauio's wing: And sodaine push giues them the ouerthrow: Ride, ride Messala, let them all come downe. O looke Titinius, looke, the Villaines flye: My selfe haue to mine owne turn'd Enemy: This Ensigne heere of mine was turning backe, I slew the Coward, and did take it from him O Cassius, Brutus gaue the word too early, Who hauing some aduantage on Octauius, Tooke it too eagerly: his Soldiers fell to spoyle, Whilst we by Antony are all inclos'd. Fly further off my Lord: flye further off, Mark Antony is in your Tents my Lord: Flye therefore Noble Cassius, flye farre off This Hill is farre enough. Looke, look Titinius Are those my Tents where I perceiue the fire? They are, my Lord Titinius, if thou louest me, Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurres in him, Till he haue brought thee vp to yonder Troopes And heere againe, that I may rest assur'd Whether yond Troopes, are Friend or Enemy I will be heere againe, euen with a thought. Go Pindarus, get higher on that hill, My sight was euer thicke: regard Titinius, And tell me what thou not'st about the Field. This day I breathed first, Time is come round, And where I did begin, there shall I end, My life is run his compasse. Sirra, what newes? Aboue. O my Lord What newes? Titinius is enclosed round about With Horsemen, that make to him on the Spurre, Yet he spurres on. Now they are almost on him: Now Titinius. Now some light: O he lights too. Hee's tane. And hearke, they shout for ioy Come downe, behold no more: O Coward that I am, to liue so long, To see my best Friend tane before my face Come hither sirrah: In Parthia did I take thee Prisoner, And then I swore thee, sauing of thy life, That whatsoeuer I did bid thee do, Thou should'st attempt it. Come now, keepe thine oath, Now be a Free-man, and with this good Sword That ran through Caesars bowels, search this bosome. Stand not to answer: Heere, take thou the Hilts, And when my face is couer'd, as 'tis now, Guide thou the Sword- Caesar, thou art reueng'd, Euen with the Sword that kill'd thee So, I am free, Yet would not so haue beene Durst I haue done my will. O Cassius, Farre from this Country Pindarus shall run, Where neuer Roman shall take note of him. It is but change, Titinius: for Octauius Is ouerthrowne by Noble Brutus power, As Cassius Legions are by Antony These tydings will well comfort Cassius Where did you leaue him All disconsolate, With Pindarus his Bondman, on this Hill Is not that he that lyes vpon the ground? He lies not like the Liuing. O my heart! Is not that hee? No, this was he Messala, But Cassius is no more. O setting Sunne: As in thy red Rayes thou doest sinke to night; So in his red blood Cassius day is set. The Sunne of Rome is set. Our day is gone, Clowds, Dewes, and Dangers come; our deeds are done: Mistrust of my successe hath done this deed Mistrust of good successe hath done this deed. O hatefull Error, Melancholies Childe: Why do'st thou shew to the apt thoughts of men The things that are not? O Error soone conceyu'd, Thou neuer com'st vnto a happy byrth, But kil'st the Mother that engendred thee What Pindarus? Where art thou Pindarus? Seeke him Titinius, whilst I go to meet The Noble Brutus, thrusting this report Into his eares; I may say thrusting it: For piercing Steele, and Darts inuenomed, Shall be as welcome to the eares of Brutus, As tydings of this sight Hye you Messala, And I will seeke for Pindarus the while: Why did'st thou send me forth braue Cassius? Did I not meet thy Friends, and did not they Put on my Browes this wreath of Victorie, And bid me giue it thee? Did'st thou not heare their showts? Alas, thou hast misconstrued euery thing. But hold thee, take this Garland on thy Brow, Thy Brutus bid me giue it thee, and I Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace, And see how I regarded Caius Cassius: By your leaue Gods: This is a Romans part, Come Cassius Sword, and finde Titinius hart. Dies Where, where Messala, doth his body lye? Loe yonder, and Titinius mourning it Titinius face is vpward He is slaine O Iulius Caesar, thou art mighty yet, Thy Spirit walkes abroad, and turnes our Swords In our owne proper Entrailes. Low Alarums Braue Titinius, Looke where he haue not crown'd dead Cassius Are yet two Romans liuing such as these? The last of all the Romans, far thee well: It is impossible, that euer Rome Should breed thy fellow. Friends I owe mo teares To this dead man, then you shall see me pay. I shall finde time, Cassius: I shall finde time. Come therefore, and to Tharsus send his body, His Funerals shall not be in our Campe, Least it discomfort vs. Lucillius come, And come yong Cato, let vs to the Field, Labio and Flauio set our Battailes on: 'Tis three a clocke, and Romans yet ere night, We shall try Fortune in a second fight. Yet Country-men: O yet, hold vp your heads What Bastard doth not? Who will go with me? I will proclaime my name about the Field. I am the Sonne of Marcus Cato, hoe. A Foe to Tyrants, and my Countries Friend. I am the Sonne of Marcus Cato, hoe. And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I, Brutus my Countries Friend: Know me for Brutus O yong and Noble Cato, art thou downe? Why now thou dyest, as brauely as Titinius, And may'st be honour'd, being Cato's Sonne Yeeld, or thou dyest Onely I yeeld to dye: There is so much, that thou wilt kill me straight: Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death We must not: a Noble Prisoner. 2.Sold. Roome hoe: tell Antony, Brutus is tane 1.Sold. Ile tell thee newes. Heere comes the Generall, Brutus is tane, Brutus is tane my Lord Where is hee? Safe Antony, Brutus is safe enough: I dare assure thee, that no Enemy Shall euer take aliue the Noble Brutus: The Gods defend him from so great a shame, When you do finde him, or aliue, or dead, He will be found like Brutus, like himselfe This is not Brutus friend, but I assure you, A prize no lesse in worth; keepe this man safe, Giue him all kindnesse. I had rather haue Such men my Friends, then Enemies. Go on, And see where Brutus be aliue or dead, And bring vs word, vnto Octauius Tent: How euery thing is chanc'd. Come poore remaines of friends, rest on this Rocke Statillius shew'd the Torch-light, but my Lord He came not backe: he is or tane, or slaine Sit thee downe, Clitus: slaying is the word, It is a deed in fashion. Hearke thee, Clitus What I, my Lord? No, not for all the World Peace then, no words Ile rather kill my selfe Hearke thee, Dardanius Shall I doe such a deed? O Dardanius O Clitus What ill request did Brutus make to thee? To kill him, Clitus: looke he meditates Now is that Noble Vessell full of griefe, That it runnes ouer euen at his eyes Come hither, good Volumnius, list a word What sayes my Lord? Why this, Volumnius: The Ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me Two seuerall times by Night: at Sardis, once; And this last Night, here in Philippi fields: I know my houre is come Not so, my Lord Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius. Thou seest the World, Volumnius, how it goes, Our Enemies haue beat vs to the Pit: Low Alarums. It is more worthy, to leape in our selues, Then tarry till they push vs. Good Volumnius, Thou know'st, that we two went to Schoole together: Euen for that our loue of old, I prethee Hold thou my Sword Hilts, whilest I runne on it That's not an Office for a friend, my Lord. Fly, flye my Lord, there is no tarrying heere Farewell to you, and you, and Volumnius. Strato, thou hast bin all this while asleepe: Farewell to thee, to Strato, Countrymen: My heart doth ioy, that yet in all my life, I found no man, but he was true to me. I shall haue glory by this loosing day More then Octauius, and Marke Antony, By this vile Conquest shall attaine vnto. So fare you well at once, for Brutus tongue Hath almost ended his liues History: Night hangs vpon mine eyes, my Bones would rest, That haue but labour'd, to attaine this houre. Fly my Lord, flye Hence: I will follow: I prythee Strato, stay thou by thy Lord, Thou art a Fellow of a good respect: Thy life hath had some smatch of Honor in it, Hold then my Sword, and turne away thy face, While I do run vpon it. Wilt thou Strato? Giue me your hand first. Fare you wel my Lord Farewell good Strato. - Caesar, now be still, I kill'd not thee with halfe so good a will. the What man is that? My Masters man. Strato, where is thy Master? Free from the Bondage you are in Messala, The Conquerors can but make a fire of him: For Brutus onely ouercame himselfe, And no man else hath Honor by his death So Brutus should be found. I thank thee Brutus That thou hast prou'd Lucillius saying true, All that seru'd Brutus, I will entertaine them. Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me? I, if Messala will preferre me to you Do so, good Messala How dyed my Master Strato? I held the Sword, and he did run on it Octauius, then take him to follow thee, That did the latest seruice to my Master This was the Noblest Roman of them all: All the Conspirators saue onely hee, Did that they did, in enuy of great Caesar: He, onely in a generall honest thought, And common good to all, made one of them. His life was gentle, and the Elements So mixt in him, that Nature might stand vp, And say to all the world; This was a man According to his Vertue, let vs vse him Withall Respect, and Rites of Buriall. Most like a Souldier ordered Honourably: So call the Field to rest, and let's away, To part the glories of this happy day. As I remember Adam, it was vpon this fashion bequeathed me by will, but poore a thousand Crownes, and as thou saist, charged my brother on his blessing to breed mee well: and there begins my sadnesse: My brother Iaques he keepes at schoole, and report speakes goldenly of his profit: for my part, he keepes me rustically at home, or (to speak more properly) staies me heere at home vnkept: for call you that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that differs not from the stalling of an Oxe? his horses are bred better, for besides that they are faire with their feeding, they are taught their mannage, and to that end Riders deerely hir'd: but I (his brother) gaine nothing vnder him but growth, for the which his Animals on his dunghils are as much bound to him as I: besides this nothing that he so plentifully giues me, the something that nature gaue mee, his countenance seemes to take from me: hee lets mee feede with his Hindes, barres mee the place of a brother, and as much as in him lies, mines my gentility with my education. This is it Adam that grieues me, and the spirit of my Father, which I thinke is within mee, begins to mutinie against this seruitude. I will no longer endure it, though yet I know no wise remedy how to auoid it. Yonder comes my Master, your brother Goe a-part Adam, and thou shalt heare how he will shake me vp Now Sir, what make you heere? Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing What mar you then sir? Marry sir, I am helping you to mar that which God made, a poore vnworthy brother of yours with idlenesse Marry sir be better employed, and be naught a while Shall I keepe your hogs, and eat huskes with them? what prodigall portion haue I spent, that I should come to such penury? Know you where you are sir? O sir, very well: heere in your Orchard Know you before whom sir? I, better then him I am before knowes mee: I know you are my eldest brother, and in the gentle condition of bloud you should so know me: the courtesie of nations allowes you my better, in that you are the first borne, but the same tradition takes not away my bloud, were there twenty brothers betwixt vs: I haue as much of my father in mee, as you, albeit I confesse your comming before me is neerer to his reuerence What Boy Come, come elder brother, you are too yong in this Wilt thou lay hands on me villaine? I am no villaine: I am the yongest sonne of Sir Rowland de Boys, he was my father, and he is thrice a villaine that saies such a father begot villaines: wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand from thy throat, till this other had puld out thy tongue for saying so, thou hast raild on thy selfe Sweet Masters bee patient, for your Fathers remembrance, be at accord Let me goe I say I will not till I please: you shall heare mee: my father charg'd you in his will to giue me good education: you haue train'd me like a pezant, obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like qualities: the spirit of my father growes strong in mee, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or giue mee the poore allottery my father left me by testament, with that I will goe buy my fortunes And what wilt thou do? beg when that is spent? Well sir, get you in. I will not long be troubled with you: you shall haue some part of your will, I pray you leaue me I will no further offend you, then becomes mee for my good Get you with him, you olde dogge Is old dogge my reward: most true, I haue lost my teeth in your seruice: God be with my olde master, he would not haue spoke such a word. Orl. Ad. Is it euen so, begin you to grow vpon me? I will physicke your ranckenesse, and yet giue no thousand crownes neyther: holla Dennis. Calls your worship? Was not Charles the Dukes Wrastler heere to speake with me? So please you, he is heere at the doore, and importunes accesse to you Call him in: 'twill be a good way: and to morrow the wrastling is. Good morrow to your worship Good Mounsier Charles: what's the new newes at the new Court? There's no newes at the Court Sir, but the olde newes: that is, the old Duke is banished by his yonger brother the new Duke, and three or foure louing Lords haue put themselues into voluntary exile with him, whose lands and reuenues enrich the new Duke, therefore he giues them good leaue to wander Can you tell if Rosalind the Dukes daughter bee banished with her Father? O no; for the Dukes daughter her Cosen so loues her, being euer from their Cradles bred together, that hee would haue followed her exile, or haue died to stay behind her; she is at the Court, and no lesse beloued of her Vncle, then his owne daughter, and neuer two Ladies loued as they doe Where will the old Duke liue? They say hee is already in the Forrest of Arden, and a many merry men with him; and there they liue like the old Robin Hood of England: they say many yong Gentlemen flocke to him euery day, and fleet the time carelesly as they did in the golden world What, you wrastle to morrow before the new Duke Marry doe I sir: and I came to acquaint you with a matter: I am giuen sir secretly to vnderstand, that your yonger brother Orlando hath a disposition to come in disguis'd against mee to try a fall: to morrow sir I wrastle for my credit, and hee that escapes me without some broken limbe, shall acquit him well: your brother is but young and tender, and for your loue I would bee loth to foyle him, as I must for my owne honour if hee come in: therefore out of my loue to you, I came hither to acquaint you withall, that either you might stay him from his intendment, or brooke such disgrace well as he shall runne into, in that it is a thing of his owne search, and altogether against my will Charles , I thanke thee for thy loue to me, which thou shalt finde I will most kindly requite: I had my selfe notice of my Brothers purpose heerein, and haue by vnder-hand meanes laboured to disswade him from it; but he is resolute. Ile tell thee Charles, it is the stubbornest yong fellow of France, full of ambition, an enuious emulator of euery mans good parts, a secret & villanous contriuer against mee his naturall brother: therefore vse thy discretion, I had as liefe thou didst breake his necke as his finger. And thou wert best looke to't; for if thou dost him any slight disgrace, or if hee doe not mightilie grace himselfe on thee, hee will practise against thee by poyson, entrap thee by some treacherous deuise, and neuer leaue thee till he hath tane thy life by some indirect meanes or other: for I assure thee, (and almost with teares I speake it) there is not one so young, and so villanous this day liuing. I speake but brotherly of him, but should I anathomize him to thee, as hee is, I must blush, and weepe, and thou must looke pale and wonder I am heartily glad I came hither to you: if hee come to morrow, Ile giue him his payment: if euer hee goe alone againe, Ile neuer wrastle for prize more: and so God keepe your worship. Farewell good Charles. Now will I stirre this Gamester: I hope I shall see an end of him; for my soule (yet I know not why) hates nothing more then he: yet hee's gentle, neuer school'd, and yet learned, full of noble deuise, of all sorts enchantingly beloued, and indeed so much in the heart of the world, and especially of my owne people, who best know him, that I am altogether misprised: but it shall not be so long, this wrastler shall cleare all: nothing remaines, but that I kindle the boy thither, which now Ile goe about. Scoena Secunda. I pray thee Rosalind, sweet my Coz, be merry Deere Cellia; I show more mirth then I am mistresse of, and would you yet were merrier: vnlesse you could teach me to forget a banished father, you must not learne mee how to remember any extraordinary pleasure Heerein I see thou lou'st mee not with the full waight that I loue thee; if my Vncle thy banished father had banished thy Vncle the Duke my Father, so thou hadst beene still with mee, I could haue taught my loue to take thy father for mine; so wouldst thou, if the truth of thy loue to me were so righteously temper'd, as mine is to thee Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to reioyce in yours You know my Father hath no childe, but I, nor none is like to haue; and truely when he dies, thou shalt be his heire; for what hee hath taken away from thy father perforce, I will render thee againe in affection: by mine honor I will, and when I breake that oath, let mee turne monster: therefore my sweet Rose, my deare Rose, be merry From henceforth I will Coz, and deuise sports: let me see, what thinke you of falling in Loue? Marry I prethee doe, to make sport withall: but loue no man in good earnest, nor no further in sport neyther, then with safety of a pure blush, thou maist in honor come off againe What shall be our sport then? Let vs sit and mocke the good houswife Fortune from her wheele, that her gifts may henceforth bee bestowed equally I would wee could doe so: for her benefits are mightily misplaced, and the bountifull blinde woman doth most mistake in her gifts to women 'Tis true, for those that she makes faire, she scarce makes honest, & those that she makes honest, she makes very illfauouredly Nay now thou goest from Fortunes office to Natures: Fortune reignes in gifts of the world, not in the lineaments of Nature. No; when Nature hath made a faire creature, may she not by Fortune fall into the fire? though nature hath giuen vs wit to flout at Fortune, hath not Fortune sent in this foole to cut off the argument? Indeed there is fortune too hard for nature, when fortune makes natures naturall, the cutter off of natures witte Peraduenture this is not Fortunes work neither, but Natures, who perceiueth our naturall wits too dull to reason of such goddesses, hath sent this Naturall for our whetstone: for alwaies the dulnesse of the foole, is the whetstone of the wits. How now Witte, whether wander you? Mistresse, you must come away to your father Were you made the messenger? No by mine honor, but I was bid to come for you Where learned you that oath foole? Of a certaine Knight, that swore by his Honour they were good Pan-cakes, and swore by his Honor the Mustard was naught: Now Ile stand to it, the Pancakes were naught, and the Mustard was good, and yet was not the Knight forsworne How proue you that in the great heape of your knowledge? I marry, now vnmuzzle your wisedome Stand you both forth now: stroke your chinnes, and sweare by your beards that I am a knaue By our beards (if we had them) thou art By my knauerie (if I had it) then I were: but if you sweare by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no more was this knight swearing by his Honor, for he neuer had anie; or if he had, he had sworne it away, before euer he saw those Pancakes, or that Mustard Prethee, who is't that thou means't? One that old Fredericke your Father loues My Fathers loue is enough to honor him enough; speake no more of him, you'l be whipt for taxation one of these daies The more pittie that fooles may not speak wisely, what Wisemen do foolishly By my troth thou saiest true: For, since the little wit that fooles haue was silenced, the little foolerie that wise men haue makes a great shew; Heere comes Monsieur the Beu. With his mouth full of newes Which he will put on vs, as Pigeons feed their young Then shal we be newes-cram'd All the better: we shalbe the more Marketable. Boon-iour Monsieur le Beu, what's the newes? Le Beu. Faire Princesse, you haue lost much good sport Sport: of what colour? Le Beu. What colour Madame? How shall I aunswer you? As wit and fortune will Or as the destinies decrees Well said, that was laid on with a trowell Nay, if I keepe not my ranke Thou loosest thy old smell Le Beu. You amaze me Ladies: I would haue told you of good wrastling, which you haue lost the sight of Yet tell vs the manner of the Wrastling Le Beu. I wil tell you the beginning: and if it please your Ladiships, you may see the end, for the best is yet to doe, and heere where you are, they are comming to performe it Well, the beginning that is dead and buried Le Beu. There comes an old man, and his three sons I could match this beginning with an old tale Le Beu. Three proper yong men, of excellent growth and presence With bils on their neckes: Be it knowne vnto all men by these presents Le Beu. The eldest of the three, wrastled with Charles the Dukes Wrastler, which Charles in a moment threw him, and broke three of his ribbes, that there is little hope of life in him: So he seru'd the second, and so the third: yonder they lie, the poore old man their Father, making such pittiful dole ouer them, that all the beholders take his part with weeping Alas But what is the sport Monsieur, that the Ladies haue lost? Le Beu. Why this that I speake of Thus men may grow wiser euery day. It is the first time that euer I heard breaking of ribbes was sport for Ladies Or I, I promise thee But is there any else longs to see this broken Musicke in his sides? Is there yet another doates vpon rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrastling Cosin? Le Beu. You must if you stay heere, for heere is the place appointed for the wrastling, and they are ready to performe it Yonder sure they are comming. Let vs now stay and see it. Come on, since the youth will not be intreated His owne perill on his forwardnesse Is yonder the man? Le Beu. Euen he, Madam Alas, he is too yong: yet he looks successefully How now daughter, and Cousin: Are you crept hither to see the wrastling? I my Liege, so please you giue vs leaue You wil take little delight in it, I can tell you there is such oddes in the man: In pitie of the challengers youth, I would faine disswade him, but he will not bee entreated. Speake to him Ladies, see if you can mooue him Call him hether good Monsieuer Le Beu Do so: Ile not be by Le Beu. Monsieur the Challenger, the Princesse cals for you I attend them with all respect and dutie Young man, haue you challeng'd Charles the Wrastler? No faire Princesse: he is the generall challenger, I come but in as others do, to try with him the strength of my youth Yong Gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your yeares: you haue seene cruell proofe of this mans strength, if you saw your selfe with your eies, or knew your selfe with your iudgment, the feare of your aduenture would counsel you to a more equall enterprise. We pray you for your owne sake to embrace your own safetie, and giue ouer this attempt Do yong Sir, your reputation shall not therefore be misprised: we wil make it our suite to the Duke, that the wrastling might not go forward I beseech you, punish mee not with your harde thoughts, wherein I confesse me much guiltie to denie so faire and excellent Ladies anie thing. But let your faire eies, and gentle wishes go with mee to my triall; wherein if I bee foil'd, there is but one sham'd that was neuer gracious: if kil'd, but one dead that is willing to be so: I shall do my friends no wrong, for I haue none to lament me: the world no iniurie, for in it I haue nothing: onely in the world I fil vp a place, which may bee better supplied, when I haue made it emptie The little strength that I haue, I would it were with you And mine to eeke out hers Fare you well: praie heauen I be deceiu'd in you Your hearts desires be with you Come, where is this yong gallant, that is so desirous to lie with his mother earth? Readie Sir, but his will hath in it a more modest working You shall trie but one fall No, I warrant your Grace you shall not entreat him to a second, that haue so mightilie perswaded him from a first You meane to mocke me after: you should not haue mockt me before: but come your waies Now Hercules, be thy speede yong man I would I were inuisible, to catch the strong fellow by the legge. Oh excellent yong man If I had a thunderbolt in mine eie, I can tell who should downe. No more, no more Yes I beseech your Grace, I am not yet well breath'd How do'st thou Charles? Le Beu. He cannot speake my Lord Beare him awaie: What is thy name yong man? Orlando my Liege, the yongest sonne of Sir Roland de Boys I would thou hadst beene son to some man else, The world esteem'd thy father honourable, But I did finde him still mine enemie: Thou should'st haue better pleas'd me with this deede, Hadst thou descended from another house: But fare thee well, thou art a gallant youth, I would thou had'st told me of another Father. Were I my Father (Coze) would I do this? I am more proud to be Sir Rolands sonne, His yongest sonne, and would not change that calling To be adopted heire to Fredricke My Father lou'd Sir Roland as his soule, And all the world was of my Fathers minde, Had I before knowne this yong man his sonne, I should haue giuen him teares vnto entreaties, Ere he should thus haue ventur'd Gentle Cosen, Let vs goe thanke him, and encourage him: My Fathers rough and enuious disposition Sticks me at heart: Sir, you haue well deseru'd, If you doe keepe your promises in loue; But iustly as you haue exceeded all promise, Your Mistris shall be happie Gentleman, Weare this for me: one out of suites with fortune That could giue more, but that her hand lacks meanes. Shall we goe Coze? I: fare you well faire Gentleman Can I not say, I thanke you? My better parts Are all throwne downe, and that which here stands vp Is but a quintine, a meere liuelesse blocke He cals vs back: my pride fell with my fortunes, Ile aske him what he would: Did you call Sir? Sir, you haue wrastled well, and ouerthrowne More then your enemies Will you goe Coze? Haue with you: fare you well. What passion hangs these waights vpo my toong? I cannot speake to her, yet she vrg'd conference. O poore Orlando! thou art ouerthrowne Or Charles, or something weaker masters thee Le Beu. Good Sir, I do in friendship counsaile you To leaue this place; Albeit you haue deseru'd High commendation, true applause, and loue; Yet such is now the Dukes condition, That he misconsters all that you haue done: The Duke is humorous, what he is indeede More suites you to conceiue, then I to speake of I thanke you Sir; and pray you tell me this, Which of the two was daughter of the Duke, That here was at the Wrastling? Le Beu. Neither his daughter, if we iudge by manners, But yet indeede the taller is his daughter, The other is daughter to the banish'd Duke, And here detain'd by her vsurping Vncle To keepe his daughter companie, whose loues Are deerer then the naturall bond of Sisters: But I can tell you, that of late this Duke Hath tane displeasure 'gainst his gentle Neece, Grounded vpon no other argument, But that the people praise her for her vertues, And pittie her, for her good Fathers sake; And on my life his malice 'gainst the Lady Will sodainly breake forth: Sir, fare you well, Hereafter in a better world then this, I shall desire more loue and knowledge of you I rest much bounden to you: fare you well. Thus must I from the smoake into the smother, From tyrant Duke, vnto a tyrant Brother. But heauenly Rosaline. Scena Tertius. Why Cosen, why Rosaline: Cupid haue mercie, Not a word? Not one to throw at a dog No, thy words are too precious to be cast away vpon curs, throw some of them at me; come lame mee with reasons Then there were two Cosens laid vp, when the one should be lam'd with reasons, and the other mad without any But is all this for your Father? No, some of it is for my childes Father: Oh how full of briers is this working day world They are but burs, Cosen, throwne vpon thee in holiday foolerie, if we walke not in the trodden paths our very petty-coates will catch them I could shake them off my coate, these burs are in my heart Hem them away I would try if I could cry hem, and haue him Come, come, wrastle with thy affections O they take the part of a better wrastler then my selfe O, a good wish vpon you: you will trie in time in dispight of a fall: but turning these iests out of seruice, let vs talke in good earnest: Is it possible on such a sodaine, you should fall into so strong a liking with old Sir Roulands yongest sonne? The Duke my Father lou'd his Father deerelie Doth it therefore ensue that you should loue his Sonne deerelie? By this kinde of chase, I should hate him, for my father hated his father deerely; yet I hate not Orlando No faith, hate him not for my sake Why should I not? doth he not deserue well? Let me loue him for that, and do you loue him Because I doe. Looke, here comes the Duke With his eies full of anger Mistris, dispatch you with your safest haste, And get you from our Court Me Vncle You Cosen, So neere our publike Court as twentie miles, Thou diest for it I doe beseech your Grace Let me the knowledge of my fault beare with me: If with my selfe I hold intelligence, Or haue acquaintance with mine owne desires, If that I doe not dreame, or be not franticke, (As I doe trust I am not) then deere Vncle, Neuer so much as in a thought vnborne, Did I offend your highnesse Thus doe all Traitors, If their purgation did consist in words, They are as innocent as grace it selfe; Let is suffice thee that I trust thee not Yet your mistrust cannot make me a Traitor; Tell me whereon the likelihoods depends? Thou art thy Fathers daughter, there's enough So was I when your highnes took his Dukdome, So was I when your highnesse banisht him; Treason is not inherited my Lord, Or if we did deriue it from our friends, What's that to me, my Father was no Traitor, Then good my Leige, mistake me not so much, To thinke my pouertie is treacherous Deere Soueraigne heare me speake I Celia, we staid her for your sake, Else had she with her Father rang'd along I did not then intreat to haue her stay, It was your pleasure, and your owne remorse, I was too yong that time to value her, But now I know her: if she be a Traitor, Why so am I: we still haue slept together, Rose at an instant, learn'd, plaid, eate together, And wheresoere we went, like Iunos Swans, Still we went coupled and inseperable She is too subtile for thee, and her smoothnes; Her verie silence, and her patience, Speake to the people, and they pittie her: Thou art a foole, she robs thee of thy name, And thou wilt show more bright, & seem more vertuous When she is gone: then open not thy lips Firme, and irreuocable is my doombe, Which I haue past vpon her, she is banish'd Pronounce that sentence then on me my Leige, I cannot liue out of her companie You are a foole: you Neice prouide your selfe, If you out-stay the time, vpon mine honor, And in the greatnesse of my word you die. O my poore Rosaline, whether wilt thou goe? Wilt thou change Fathers? I will giue thee mine: I charge thee be not thou more grieu'd then I am I haue more cause Thou hast not Cosen, Prethee be cheerefull; know'st thou not the Duke Hath banish'd me his daughter? That he hath not No, hath not? Rosaline lacks then the loue Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one, Shall we be sundred? shall we part sweete girle? No, let my Father seeke another heire: Therefore deuise with me how we may flie Whether to goe, and what to beare with vs, And doe not seeke to take your change vpon you, To beare your griefes your selfe, and leaue me out: For by this heauen, now at our sorrowes pale; Say what thou canst, Ile goe along with thee Why, whether shall we goe? To seeke my Vncle in the Forrest of Arden Alas, what danger will it be to vs, (Maides as we are) to trauell forth so farre? Beautie prouoketh theeues sooner then gold Ile put my selfe in poore and meane attire, And with a kinde of vmber smirch my face, The like doe you, so shall we passe along, And neuer stir assailants Were it not better, Because that I am more then common tall, That I did suite me all points like a man, A gallant curtelax vpon my thigh, A bore-speare in my hand, and in my heart Lye there what hidden womans feare there will, Weele haue a swashing and a marshall outside, As manie other mannish cowards haue, That doe outface it with their semblances What shall I call thee when thou art a man? Ile haue no worse a name then Ioues owne Page, And therefore looke you call me Ganimed. But what will you be call'd? Something that hath a reference to my state: No longer Celia, but Aliena But Cosen, what if we assaid to steale The clownish Foole out of your Fathers Court: Would he not be a comfort to our trauaile? Heele goe along ore the wide world with me, Leaue me alone to woe him; Let's away And get our Iewels and our wealth together, Deuise the fittest time, and safest way To hide vs from pursuite that will be made After my flight: now goe in we content To libertie, and not to banishment. Sen. Now my Coe-mates, and brothers in exile: Hath not old custome made this life more sweete Then that of painted pompe? Are not these woods More free from perill then the enuious Court? Heere feele we not the penaltie of Adam, The seasons difference, as the Icie phange And churlish chiding of the winters winde, Which when it bites and blowes vpon my body Euen till I shrinke with cold, I smile, and say This is no flattery: these are counsellors That feelingly perswade me what I am: Sweet are the vses of aduersitie Which like the toad, ougly and venemous, Weares yet a precious Iewell in his head: And this our life exempt from publike haunt, Findes tongues in trees, bookes in the running brookes, Sermons in stones, and good in euery thing I would not change it, happy is your Grace That can translate the stubbornnesse of fortune Into so quiet and so sweet a stile Sen. Come, shall we goe and kill vs venison? And yet it irkes me the poore dapled fooles Being natiue Burgers of this desert City, Should in their owne confines with forked heads Haue their round hanches goard 1.Lord. Indeed my Lord The melancholy Iaques grieues at that, And in that kinde sweares you doe more vsurpe Then doth your brother that hath banish'd you: To day my Lord of Amiens, and my selfe, Did steale behinde him as he lay along Vnder an oake, whose anticke roote peepes out Vpon the brooke that brawles along this wood, To the which place a poore sequestred Stag That from the Hunters aime had tane a hurt, Did come to languish; and indeed my Lord The wretched annimall heau'd forth such groanes That their discharge did stretch his leatherne coat Almost to bursting, and the big round teares Cours'd one another downe his innocent nose In pitteous chase: and thus the hairie foole, Much marked of the melancholie Iaques, Stood on th' extremest verge of the swift brooke, Augmenting it with teares Sen. But what said Iaques? Did he not moralize this spectacle? 1.Lord. O yes, into a thousand similies. First, for his weeping into the needlesse streame; Poore Deere quoth he, thou mak'st a testament As worldlings doe, giuing thy sum of more To that which had too much: then being there alone, Left and abandoned of his veluet friend; 'Tis right quoth he, thus miserie doth part The Fluxe of companie: anon a carelesse Heard Full of the pasture, iumps along by him And neuer staies to greet him: I quoth Iaques, Sweepe on you fat and greazie Citizens, 'Tis iust the fashion; wherefore doe you looke Vpon that poore and broken bankrupt there? Thus most inuectiuely he pierceth through The body of Countrie, Citie, Court, Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we Are meere vsurpers, tyrants, and whats worse To fright the Annimals, and to kill them vp In their assign'd and natiue dwelling place Sen. And did you leaue him in this contemplation? 2.Lord. We did my Lord, weeping and commenting Vpon the sobbing Deere Sen.

And wherefore are you gentle, strong, and valiant? Why would you be so fond to ouercome The bonnie priser of the humorous Duke? Your praise is come too swiftly home before you. Know you not Master, to seeme kinde of men, Their graces serue them but as enemies, No more doe yours: your vertues gentle Master Are sanctified and holy traitors to you: Oh what a world is this, when what is comely Enuenoms him that beares it? Why, what's the matter? O vnhappie youth, Come not within these doores: within this roofe The enemie of all your graces liues Your brother, no, no brother, yet the sonne (Yet not the son, I will not call him son) Of him I was about to call his Father, Hath heard your praises, and this night he meanes, To burne the lodging where you vse to lye, And you within it: if he faile of that He will haue other meanes to cut you off; I ouerheard him: and his practises: This is no place, this house is but a butcherie; Abhorre it, feare it, doe not enter it Why whether Adam would'st thou haue me go? No matter whether, so you come not here What, would'st thou haue me go & beg my food, Or with a base and boistrous Sword enforce A theeuish liuing on the common rode? This I must do, or know not what to do: Yet this I will not do, do how I can, I rather will subiect me to the malice Of a diuerted blood, and bloudie brother But do not so: I haue fiue hundred Crownes, The thriftie hire I saued vnder your Father, Which I did store to be my foster Nurse, When seruice should in my old limbs lie lame, And vnregarded age in corners throwne, Take that, and he that doth the Rauens feede, Yea prouidently caters for the Sparrow, Be comfort to my age: here is the gold, All this I giue you, let me be your seruant, Though I looke old, yet I am strong and lustie; For in my youth I neuer did apply Hot, and rebellious liquors in my bloud, Nor did not with vnbashfull forehead woe, The meanes of weaknesse and debilitie, Therefore my age is as a lustie winter, Frostie, but kindely; let me goe with you, Ile doe the seruice of a yonger man In all your businesse and necessities Oh good old man, how well in thee appeares The constant seruice of the antique world, When seruice sweate for dutie, not for meede: Thou art not for the fashion of these times, Where none will sweate, but for promotion, And hauing that do choake their seruice vp, Euen with the hauing, it is not so with thee: But poore old man, thou prun'st a rotten tree, That cannot so much as a blossome yeelde, In lieu of all thy paines and husbandrie, But come thy waies, weele goe along together, And ere we haue thy youthfull wages spent, Weele light vpon some setled low content Master goe on, and I will follow thee To the last gaspe with truth and loyaltie, From seauentie yeeres, till now almost fourescore Here liued I, but now liue here no more At seauenteene yeeres, many their fortunes seeke But at fourescore, it is too late a weeke, Yet fortune cannot recompence me better Then to die well, and not my Masters debter. Scena Quarta. O Iupiter, how merry are my spirits? I care not for my spirits, if my legges were not wearie I could finde in my heart to disgrace my mans apparell, and to cry like a woman: but I must comfort the weaker vessell, as doublet and hose ought to show it selfe coragious to petty-coate; therefore courage, good Aliena I pray you beare with me, I cannot goe no further For my part, I had rather beare with you, then beare you: yet I should beare no crosse if I did beare you, for I thinke you haue no money in your purse Well, this is the Forrest of Arden I, now am I in Arden, the more foole I, when I was at home I was in a better place, but Trauellers must be content. I, be so good Touchstone: Look you, who comes here, a yong man and an old in solemne talke That is the way to make her scorne you still Oh Corin, that thou knew'st how I do loue her I partly guesse: for I haue lou'd ere now No Corin, being old, thou canst not guesse, Though in thy youth thou wast as true a louer As euer sigh'd vpon a midnight pillow: But if thy loue were euer like to mine, As sure I thinke did neuer man loue so: How many actions most ridiculous, Hast thou beene drawne to by thy fantasie? Into a thousand that I haue forgotten Oh thou didst then neuer loue so hartily, If thou remembrest not the slightest folly, That euer loue did make thee run into, Thou hast not lou'd. Or if thou hast not sat as I doe now, Wearing thy hearer in thy Mistris praise, Thou hast not lou'd. Or if thou hast not broke from companie, Abruptly as my passion now makes me, Thou hast not lou'd. O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe. Alas poore Shepheard searching of they would, I haue by hard aduenture found mine owne And I mine: I remember when I was in loue, I broke my sword vpon a stone, and bid him take that for comming a night to Iane Smile, and I remember the kissing of her batler, and the Cowes dugs that her prettie chopt hands had milk'd; and I remember the wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I tooke two cods, and giuing her them againe, said with weeping teares, weare these for my sake: wee that are true Louers, runne into strange capers; but as all is mortall in nature, so is all nature in loue, mortall in folly Thou speak'st wiser then thou art ware of Nay, I shall nere be ware of mine owne wit, till I breake my shins against it Ioue, Ioue, this Shepherds passion, Is much vpon my fashion And mine, but it growes something stale with mee I pray you, one of you question yon'd man, If he for gold will giue vs any foode, I faint almost to death Holla; you Clowne Peace foole, he's not thy kinsman Who cals? Your betters Sir Else are they very wretched Peace I say; good euen to your friend And to you gentle Sir, and to you all I prethee Shepheard, if that loue or gold Can in this desert place buy entertainment, Bring vs where we may rest our selues, and feed: Here's a yong maid with trauaile much oppressed, And faints for succour Faire Sir, I pittie her, And wish for her sake more then for mine owne, My fortunes were more able to releeue her: But I am shepheard to another man, And do not sheere the Fleeces that I graze: My master is of churlish disposition, And little wreakes to finde the way to heauen By doing deeds of hospitalitie. Besides his Coate, his Flockes, and bounds of feede Are now on sale, and at our sheep-coat now By reason of his absence there is nothing That you will feed on: but what is, come see, And in my voice most welcome shall you be What is he that shall buy his flocke and pasture? That yong Swaine that you saw heere but erewhile, That little cares for buying any thing I pray thee, if it stand with honestie, Buy thou the Cottage, pasture, and the flocke, And thou shalt haue to pay for it of vs And we will mend thy wages: I like this place, and willingly could Waste my time in it Assuredly the thing is to be sold: Go with me, if you like vpon report, The soile, the profit, and this kinde of life, I will your very faithfull Feeder be, And buy it with your Gold right sodainly.

Vnder the greene wood tree, who loues to lye with mee, And turne his merrie Note, vnto the sweet Birds throte: Come hither, come hither, come hither: Heere shall he see no enemie, But Winter and rough Weather More, more, I pre'thee more It will make you melancholly Monsieur Iaques I thanke it: More, I prethee more, I can sucke melancholly out of a song, As a Weazel suckes egges: More, I pre'thee more My voice is ragged, I know I cannot please you I do not desire you to please me, I do desire you to sing: Come, more, another stanzo: Cal you 'em stanzo's? What you wil Monsieur Iaques Nay, I care not for their names, they owe mee nothing. Wil you sing? More at your request, then to please my selfe Well then, if euer I thanke any man, Ile thanke you: but that they cal complement is like th' encounter of two dog-Apes. And when a man thankes me hartily, me thinkes I haue giuen him a penie, and he renders me the beggerly thankes. Come sing; and you that wil not hold your tongues Wel, Ile end the song. Sirs, couer the while, the Duke wil drinke vnder this tree; he hath bin all this day to looke you And I haue bin all this day to auoid him: He is too disputeable for my companie: I thinke of as many matters as he, but I giue Heauen thankes, and make no boast of them. Come, warble, come. Altogether heere. Who doth ambition shunne, and loues to liue i'th Sunne: Seeking the food he eates, and pleas'd with what he gets: Come hither, come hither, come hither, Heere shall he see. &c Ile giue you a verse to this note, That I made yesterday in despight of my Inuention And Ile sing it Thus it goes. If it do come to passe, that any man turne Asse: Leauing his wealth and ease, A stubborne will to please, Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame: Heere shall he see, grosse fooles as he, And if he will come to me What's that Ducdame?

No greater heart in thee: Liue a little, comfort a little, cheere thy selfe a little. If this vncouth Forrest yeeld any thing sauage, I wil either be food for it, or bring it for foode to thee: Thy conceite is neerer death, then thy powers. For my sake be comfortable, hold death a while At the armes end: I wil heere be with thee presently, And if I bring thee not something to eate, I wil giue thee leaue to die: but if thou diest Before I come, thou art a mocker of my labor. Wel said, thou look'st cheerely, And Ile be with thee quickly: yet thou liest In the bleake aire.

Why how now Monsieur, what a life is this That your poore friends must woe your companie, What, you looke merrily A Foole, a foole: I met a foole i'th Forrest, A motley Foole (a miserable world:) As I do liue by foode, I met a foole, Who laid him downe, and bask'd him in the Sun, And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good termes, In good set termes, and yet a motley foole. Good morrow foole (quoth I:) no Sir, quoth he, Call me not foole, till heauen hath sent me fortune, And then he drew a diall from his poake, And looking on it, with lacke-lustre eye, Sayes, very wisely, it is ten a clocke: Thus we may see (quoth he) how the world wagges: 'Tis but an houre agoe, since it was nine, And after one houre more, 'twill be eleuen, And so from houre to houre, we ripe, and ripe, And then from houre to houre, we rot, and rot, And thereby hangs a tale. When I did heare The motley Foole, thus morall on the time, My Lungs began to crow like Chanticleere, That Fooles should be so deepe contemplatiue: And I did laugh, sans intermission An houre by his diall. Oh noble foole, A worthy foole: Motley's the onely weare Sen. What foole is this? O worthie Foole: One that hath bin a Courtier And sayes, if Ladies be but yong, and faire, They haue the gift to know it: and in his braine, Which is as drie as the remainder bisket After a voyage: He hath strange places cram'd With obseruation, the which he vents In mangled formes. O that I were a foole, I am ambitious for a motley coat Sen. Thou shalt haue one It is my onely suite, Prouided that you weed your better iudgements Of all opinion that growes ranke in them, That I am wise. I must haue liberty Withall, as large a Charter as the winde, To blow on whom I please, for so fooles haue: And they that are most gauled with my folly, They most must laugh: And why sir must they so? The why is plaine, as way to Parish Church: Hee, that a Foole doth very wisely hit, Doth very foolishly, although he smart Seeme senselesse of the bob. If not, The Wise-mans folly is anathomiz'd Euen by the squandring glances of the foole. Inuest me in my motley: Giue me leaue To speake my minde, and I will through and through Cleanse the foule bodie of th' infected world, If they will patiently receiue my medicine Sen. Fie on thee. I can tell what thou wouldst do What, for a Counter, would I do, but good? Sen. Most mischeeuous foule sin, in chiding sin: For thou thy selfe hast bene a Libertine, As sensuall as the brutish sting it selfe, And all th' imbossed sores, and headed euils, That thou with license of free foot hast caught, Would'st thou disgorge into the generall world Why who cries out on pride, That can therein taxe any priuate party: Doth it not flow as hugely as the Sea, Till that the wearie verie meanes do ebbe. What woman in the Citie do I name, When that I say the City woman beares The cost of Princes on vnworthy shoulders? Who can come in, and say that I meane her, When such a one as shee, such is her neighbor? Or what is he of basest function, That sayes his brauerie is not on my cost, Thinking that I meane him, but therein suites His folly to the mettle of my speech, There then, how then, what then, let me see wherein My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right, Then he hath wrong'd himselfe: if he be free, Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies Vnclaim'd of any man. But who come here? Forbeare, and eate no more Why I haue eate none yet Nor shalt not, till necessity be seru'd Of what kinde should this Cocke come of? Sen. Art thou thus bolden'd man by thy distres? Or else a rude despiser of good manners, That in ciuility thou seem'st so emptie? You touch'd my veine at first, the thorny point Of bare distresse, hath tane from me the shew Of smooth ciuility: yet am I in-land bred, And know some nourture: But forbeare, I say, He dies that touches any of this fruite, Till I, and my affaires are answered And you will not be answer'd with reason, I must dye Sen. What would you haue? Your gentlenesse shall force, more then your force Moue vs to gentlenesse I almost die for food, and let me haue it Sen. Sit downe and feed, & welcom to our table Speake you so gently? Pardon me I pray you, I thought that all things had bin sauage heere, And therefore put I on the countenance Of sterne command'ment. But what ere you are That in this desert inaccessible, Vnder the shade of melancholly boughes, Loose, and neglect the creeping houres of time: If euer you haue look'd on better dayes: If euer beene where bels haue knoll'd to Church: If euer sate at any good mans feast: If euer from your eye-lids wip'd a teare, And know what 'tis to pittie, and be pittied: Let gentlenesse my strong enforcement be, In the which hope, I blush, and hide my Sword Sen. True is it, that we haue seene better dayes, And haue with holy bell bin knowld to Church, And sat at good mens feasts, and wip'd our eies Of drops, that sacred pity hath engendred: And therefore sit you downe in gentlenesse, And take vpon command, what helpe we haue That to your wanting may be ministred Then but forbeare your food a little while: Whiles (like a Doe) I go to finde my Fawne, And giue it food. There is an old poore man, Who after me, hath many a weary steppe Limpt in pure loue: till he be first suffic'd, Opprest with two weake euils, age, and hunger, I will not touch a bit Duke Sen. Go finde him out, And we will nothing waste till you returne I thanke ye, and be blest for your good comfort Sen. Thou seest, we are not all alone vnhappie: This wide and vniuersall Theater Presents more wofull Pageants then the Sceane Wherein we play in All the world's a stage, And all the men and women, meerely Players; They haue their Exits and their Entrances, And one man in his time playes many parts, His Acts being seuen ages. At first the Infant, Mewling, and puking in the Nurses armes: Then, the whining Schoole-boy with his Satchell And shining morning face, creeping like snaile Vnwillingly to schoole. And then the Louer, Sighing like Furnace, with a wofull ballad Made to his Mistresse eye-brow. Then, a Soldier, Full of strange oaths, and bearded like the Pard, Ielous in honor, sodaine, and quicke in quarrell, Seeking the bubble Reputation Euen in the Canons mouth: And then, the Iustice In faire round belly, with good Capon lin'd, With eyes seuere, and beard of formall cut, Full of wise sawes, and moderne instances, And so he playes his part. The sixt age shifts Into the leane and slipper'd Pantaloone, With spectacles on nose, and pouch on side, His youthfull hose well sau'd, a world too wide, For his shrunke shanke, and his bigge manly voice, Turning againe toward childish trebble pipes, And whistles in his sound. Last Scene of all, That ends this strange euentfull historie, Is second childishnesse, and meere obliuion, Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans euery thing. Sen. Welcome: set downe your venerable burthen, and let him feede I thanke you most for him So had you neede, I scarce can speake to thanke you for my selfe Sen. Welcome, fall too: I wil not trouble you, As yet to question you about your fortunes: Giue vs some Musicke, and good Cozen, sing. Blow, blow, thou winter winde, Thou art not so vnkinde, as mans ingratitude Thy tooth is not so keene, because thou art not seene, although thy breath be rude. Heigh ho, sing heigh ho, vnto the greene holly, Most frendship, is fayning; most Louing, meere folly: The heigh ho, the holly, This Life is most iolly. Freize, freize, thou bitter skie that dost not bight so nigh as benefitts forgot: Though thou the waters warpe, thy sting is not so sharpe, as freind remembred not. Heigh ho, sing, &c Duke Sen.

Good old man, Thou art right welcome, as thy masters is: Support him by the arme: giue me your hand, And let me all your fortunes vnderstand. Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be: But were I not the better part made mercie, I should not seeke an absent argument Of my reuenge, thou present: but looke to it, Finde out thy brother wheresoere he is, Seeke him with Candle: bring him dead, or liuing To seeke a liuing in our Territorie. Thy Lands and all things that thou dost call thine, Worth seizure, do we seize into our hands, Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth, Of what we thinke against thee Oh that your Highnesse knew my heart in this: I neuer lou'd my brother in my life More villaine thou.

Truely Shepheard, in respect of it selfe, it is a good life; but in respect that it is a shepheards life, it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I like it verie well: but in respect that it is priuate, it is a very vild life. Now in respect it is in the fields, it pleaseth mee well: but in respect it is not in the Court, it is tedious. As it is a spare life (looke you) it fits my humor well: but as there is no more plentie in it, it goes much against my stomacke. Has't any Philosophie in thee shepheard? No more, but that I know the more one sickens, the worse at ease he is: and that hee that wants money, meanes, and content, is without three good frends. That the propertie of raine is to wet, and fire to burne: That good pasture makes fat sheepe: and that a great cause of the night, is lacke of the Sunne: That hee that hath learned no wit by Nature, nor Art, may complaine of good breeding, or comes of a very dull kindred Such a one is a naturall Philosopher: Was't euer in Court, Shepheard?

Peace you dull foole, I found them on a tree Truely the tree yeelds bad fruite Ile graffe it with you, and then I shall graffe it with a Medler: then it will be the earliest fruit i'th country: for you'l be rotten ere you bee halfe ripe, and that's the right vertue of the Medler You haue said: but whether wisely or no, let the Forrest iudge. Peace, here comes my sister reading, stand aside Why should this Desert bee, for it is vnpeopled? Noe: Tonges Ile hang on euerie tree, that shall ciuill sayings shoe. Some, how briefe the Life of man runs his erring pilgrimage, That the stretching of a span, buckles in his summe of age. Some of violated vowes, twixt the soules of friend, and friend: But vpon the fairest bowes, or at euerie sentence end; Will I Rosalinda write, teaching all that reade, to know The quintessence of euerie sprite, heauen would in little show. Therefore heauen Nature charg'd, that one bodie should be fill'd With all Graces wide enlarg'd, nature presently distill'd Helens cheeke, but not his heart, Cleopatra's Maiestie: Attalanta's better part, sad Lucrecia's Modestie. Thus Rosalinde of manie parts, by Heauenly Synode was deuis'd, Of manie faces, eyes, and hearts, to haue the touches deerest pris'd. Heauen would that shee these gifts should haue, and I to liue and die her slaue O most gentle Iupiter, what tedious homilie of Loue haue you wearied your parishioners withall, and neuer cri'de, haue patience good people How now backe friends: Shepheard, go off a little: go with him sirrah Come Shepheard, let vs make an honorable retreit, though not with bagge and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage. Didst thou heare these verses? O yes, I heard them all, and more too, for some of them had in them more feete then the Verses would beare That's no matter: the feet might beare y verses I, but the feet were lame, and could not beare themselues without the verse, and therefore stood lamely in the verse But didst thou heare without wondering, how thy name should be hang'd and carued vpon these trees? I was seuen of the nine daies out of the wonder, before you came: for looke heere what I found on a Palme tree; I was neuer so berim'd since Pythagoras time that I was an Irish Rat, which I can hardly remember Tro you, who hath done this? Is it a man? And a chaine that you once wore about his neck: change you colour? I pre'thee who? O Lord, Lord, it is a hard matter for friends to meete; but Mountaines may bee remoou'd with Earthquakes, and so encounter Nay, but who is it? Is it possible? Nay, I pre'thee now, with most petitionary vehemence, tell me who it is O wonderfull, wonderfull, and most wonderfull wonderfull, and yet againe wonderful, and after that out of all hooping Good my complection, dost thou think though I am caparison'd like a man, I haue a doublet and hose in my disposition? One inch of delay more, is a South-sea of discouerie. I pre'thee tell me, who is it quickely, and speake apace: I would thou couldst stammer, that thou might'st powre this conceal'd man out of thy mouth, as Wine comes out of a narrow-mouth'd bottle: either too much at once, or none at all. I pre'thee take the Corke out of thy mouth, that I may drinke thy tydings So you may put a man in your belly Is he of Gods making? What manner of man? Is his head worth a hat? Or his chin worth a beard? Nay, he hath but a little beard Why God will send more, if the man will bee thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin It is yong Orlando, that tript vp the Wrastlers heeles, and your heart, both in an instant Nay, but the diuell take mocking: speake sadde brow, and true maid I'faith (Coz) tis he Orlando? Orlando Alas the day, what shall I do with my doublet & hose? What did he when thou saw'st him? What sayde he? How look'd he? Wherein went he? What makes hee heere? Did he aske for me? Where remaines he? How parted he with thee? And when shalt thou see him againe? Answer me in one word You must borrow me Gargantuas mouth first: 'tis a Word too great for any mouth of this Ages size, to say I and no, to these particulars, is more then to answer in a Catechisme But doth he know that I am in this Forrest, and in mans apparrell? Looks he as freshly, as he did the day he Wrastled? It is as easie to count Atomies as to resolue the propositions of a Louer: but take a taste of my finding him, and rellish it with good obseruance. I found him vnder a tree like a drop'd Acorne It may wel be cal'd Ioues tree, when it droppes forth fruite Giue me audience, good Madam Proceed There lay hee stretch'd along like a Wounded knight Though it be pittie to see such a sight, it well becomes the ground Cry holla, to the tongue, I prethee: it curuettes vnseasonably. He was furnish'd like a Hunter O ominous, he comes to kill my Hart I would sing my song without a burthen, thou bring'st me out of tune Do you not know I am a woman, when I thinke, I must speake: sweet, say on. You bring me out. Soft, comes he not heere? 'Tis he, slinke by, and note him I thanke you for your company, but good faith I had as liefe haue beene my selfe alone And so had I: but yet for fashion sake I thanke you too, for your societie God buy you, let's meet as little as we can I do desire we may be better strangers I pray you marre no more trees with Writing Loue-songs in their barkes I pray you marre no moe of my verses with reading them ill-fauouredly Rosalinde is your loues name? Yes, Iust I do not like her name There was no thought of pleasing you when she was christen'd What stature is she of? Iust as high as my heart You are ful of prety answers: haue you not bin acquainted with goldsmiths wiues, & cond the out of rings Not so: but I answer you right painted cloath, from whence you haue studied your questions You haue a nimble wit; I thinke 'twas made of Attalanta's heeles. Will you sitte downe with me, and wee two, will raile against our Mistris the world, and all our miserie I wil chide no breather in the world but my selfe against whom I know most faults The worst fault you haue, is to be in loue 'Tis a fault I will not change, for your best vertue: I am wearie of you By my troth, I was seeking for a Foole, when I found you He is drown'd in the brooke, looke but in, and you shall see him There I shal see mine owne figure Which I take to be either a foole, or a Cipher Ile tarrie no longer with you, farewell good signior Loue I am glad of your departure: Adieu good Monsieur Melancholly I wil speake to him like a sawcie Lacky, and vnder that habit play the knaue with him, do you hear Forrester Verie wel, what would you? I pray you, what i'st a clocke? You should aske me what time o' day: there's no clocke in the Forrest Then there is no true Louer in the Forrest, else sighing euerie minute, and groaning euerie houre wold detect the lazie foot of time, as wel as a clocke And why not the swift foote of time? Had not that bin as proper? By no meanes sir; Time trauels in diuers paces, with diuers persons: Ile tel you who Time ambles withall, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops withal, and who he stands stil withall I prethee, who doth he trot withal? Marry he trots hard with a yong maid, between the contract of her marriage, and the day it is solemnizd: if the interim be but a sennight, Times pace is so hard, that it seemes the length of seuen yeare Who ambles Time withal? With a Priest that lacks Latine, and a rich man that hath not the Gowt: for the one sleepes easily because he cannot study, and the other liues merrily, because he feeles no paine: the one lacking the burthen of leane and wasteful Learning; the other knowing no burthen of heauie tedious penurie. These Time ambles withal Who doth he gallop withal? With a theefe to the gallowes: for though hee go as softly as foot can fall, he thinkes himselfe too soon there Who staies it stil withal? With Lawiers in the vacation: for they sleepe betweene Terme and Terme, and then they perceiue not how time moues Where dwel you prettie youth? With this Shepheardesse my sister: heere in the skirts of the Forrest, like fringe vpon a petticoat Are you natiue of this place? As the Conie that you see dwell where shee is kindled Your accent is something finer, then you could purchase in so remoued a dwelling I haue bin told so of many: but indeed, an olde religious Vnckle of mine taught me to speake, who was in his youth an inland man, one that knew Courtship too well: for there he fel in loue. I haue heard him read many Lectors against it, and I thanke God, I am not a Woman to be touch'd with so many giddie offences as hee hath generally tax'd their whole sex withal Can you remember any of the principall euils, that he laid to the charge of women? There were none principal, they were all like one another, as halfepence are, euerie one fault seeming monstrous, til his fellow-fault came to match it I prethee recount some of them No: I wil not cast away my physick, but on those that are sicke. There is a man haunts the Forrest, that abuses our yong plants with caruing Rosalinde on their barkes; hangs Oades vpon Hauthornes, and Elegies on brambles; all (forsooth) defying the name of Rosalinde. If I could meet that Fancie-monger, I would giue him some good counsel, for he seemes to haue the Quotidian of Loue vpon him I am he that is so Loue-shak'd, I pray you tel me your remedie There is none of my Vnckles markes vpon you: he taught me how to know a man in loue: in which cage of rushes, I am sure you art not prisoner What were his markes? A leane cheeke, which you haue not: a blew eie and sunken, which you haue not: an vnquestionable spirit, which you haue not: a beard neglected, which you haue not: (but I pardon you for that, for simply your hauing in beard, is a yonger brothers reuennew) then your hose should be vngarter'd, your bonnet vnbanded, your sleeue vnbutton'd, your shoo vnti'de, and euerie thing about you, demonstrating a carelesse desolation: but you are no such man; you are rather point deuice in your accoustrements, as louing your selfe, then seeming the Louer of any other Faire youth, I would I could make thee beleeue I Loue Me beleeue it? You may assoone make her that you Loue beleeue it, which I warrant she is apter to do, then to confesse she do's: that is one of the points, in the which women stil giue the lie to their consciences. But in good sooth, are you he that hangs the verses on the Trees, wherein Rosalind is so admired? I sweare to thee youth, by the white hand of Rosalind, I am that he, that vnfortunate he But are you so much in loue, as your rimes speak? Neither rime nor reason can expresse how much Loue is meerely a madnesse, and I tel you, deserues as wel a darke house, and a whip, as madmen do: and the reason why they are not so punish'd and cured, is that the Lunacie is so ordinarie, that the whippers are in loue too: yet I professe curing it by counsel Did you euer cure any so? Yes one, and in this manner. Hee was to imagine me his Loue, his Mistris: and I set him euerie day to woe me. At which time would I, being but a moonish youth, greeue, be effeminate, changeable, longing, and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow, inconstant, ful of teares, full of smiles; for euerie passion something, and for no passion truly any thing, as boyes and women are for the most part, cattle of this colour: would now like him, now loath him: then entertaine him, then forswear him: now weepe for him, then spit at him; that I draue my Sutor from his mad humor of loue, to a liuing humor of madnes, w was to forsweare the ful stream of y world, and to liue in a nooke meerly Monastick: and thus I cur'd him, and this way wil I take vpon mee to wash your Liuer as cleane as a sound sheepes heart, that there shal not be one spot of Loue in't I would not be cured, youth I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind, and come euerie day to my Coat, and woe me Now by the faith of my loue, I will; Tel me where it is Go with me to it, and Ile shew it you: and by the way, you shal tell me, where in the Forrest you liue: Wil you go? With all my heart, good youth Nay, you must call mee Rosalind: Come sister, will you go? Scoena Tertia. Come apace good Audrey, I wil fetch vp your Goates, Audrey: and how Audrey am I the man yet? Doth my simple feature content you? Your features, Lord warrant vs: what features? I am heere with thee, and thy Goats, as the most capricious Poet honest Ouid was among the Gothes O knowledge ill inhabited, worse then Ioue in a thatch'd house When a mans verses cannot be vnderstood, nor a mans good wit seconded with the forward childe, vnderstanding: it strikes a man more dead then a great reckoning in a little roome: truly, I would the Gods hadde made thee poeticall I do not know what Poetical is: is it honest in deed and word: is it a true thing? No trulie: for the truest poetrie is the most faining, and Louers are giuen to Poetrie: and what they sweare in Poetrie, may be said as Louers, they do feigne Do you wish then that the Gods had made me Poeticall? I do truly: for thou swear'st to me thou art honest: Now if thou wert a Poet, I might haue some hope thou didst feigne Would you not haue me honest? No truly, vnlesse thou wert hard fauour'd: for honestie coupled to beautie, is to haue Honie a sawce to Sugar A materiall foole Well, I am not faire, and therefore I pray the Gods make me honest Truly, and to cast away honestie vppon a foule slut, were to put good meate into an vncleane dish I am not a slut, though I thanke the Goddes I am foule Well, praised be the Gods, for thy foulnesse; sluttishnesse may come heereafter. But be it, as it may bee, I wil marrie thee: and to that end, I haue bin with Sir Oliuer Mar-text, the Vicar of the next village, who hath promis'd to meete me in this place of the Forrest, and to couple vs I would faine see this meeting Wel, the Gods giue vs ioy Amen. A man may if he were of a fearful heart, stagger in this attempt: for heere wee haue no Temple but the wood, no assembly but horne-beasts. But what though? Courage. As hornes are odious, they are necessarie. It is said, many a man knowes no end of his goods; right: Many a man has good Hornes, and knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowrie of his wife, 'tis none of his owne getting; hornes, euen so poore men alone: No, no, the noblest Deere hath them as huge as the Rascall: Is the single man therefore blessed? No, as a wall'd Towne is more worthier then a village, so is the forehead of a married man, more honourable then the bare brow of a Batcheller: and by how much defence is better then no skill, by so much is a horne more precious then to want. Heere comes Sir Oliuer: Sir Oliuer Mar-text you are wel met. Will you dispatch vs heere vnder this tree, or shal we go with you to your Chappell? Is there none heere to giue the woman? I wil not take her on guift of any man Truly she must be giuen, or the marriage is not lawfull Proceed, proceede: Ile giue her Good euen good Mr what ye cal't: how do you Sir, you are verie well met: goddild you for your last companie, I am verie glad to see you, euen a toy in hand heere Sir: Nay, pray be couer'd Wil you be married, Motley? As the Oxe hath his bow sir, the horse his curb, and the Falcon her bels, so man hath his desires, and as Pigeons bill, so wedlocke would be nibling And wil you (being a man of your breeding) be married vnder a bush like a begger? Get you to church, and haue a good Priest that can tel you what marriage is, this fellow wil but ioyne you together, as they ioyne Wainscot, then one of you wil proue a shrunke pannell, and like greene timber, warpe, warpe I am not in the minde, but I were better to bee married of him then of another, for he is not like to marrie me wel: and not being wel married, it wil be a good excuse for me heereafter, to leaue my wife Goe thou with mee, And let me counsel thee Come sweete Audrey, We must be married, or we must liue in baudrey: Farewel good Mr Oliuer: Not O sweet Oliuer, O braue Oliuer leaue me not behind thee: But winde away, bee gone I say, I wil not to wedding with thee 'Tis no matter; Ne're a fantastical knaue of them all shal flout me out of my calling. Scoena Quarta. Neuer talke to me, I wil weepe Do I prethee, but yet haue the grace to consider, that teares do not become a man But haue I not cause to weepe? As good cause as one would desire, Therefore weepe His very haire Is of the dissembling colour Something browner then Iudasses: Marrie his kisses are Iudasses owne children I'faith his haire is of a good colour An excellent colour: Your Chessenut was euer the onely colour: And his kissing is as ful of sanctitie, As the touch of holy bread Hee hath bought a paire of cast lips of Diana: a Nun of winters sisterhood kisses not more religiouslie, the very yce of chastity is in them But why did hee sweare hee would come this morning, and comes not? Nay certainly there is no truth in him Doe you thinke so? Yes, I thinke he is not a picke purse, nor a horse-stealer, but for his verity in loue, I doe thinke him as concaue as a couered goblet, or a Worme-eaten nut Not true in loue? Yes, when he is in, but I thinke he is not in You haue heard him sweare downright he was Was, is not is: besides, the oath of Louer is no stronger then the word of a Tapster, they are both the confirmer of false reckonings, he attends here in the forrest on the Duke your father I met the Duke yesterday, and had much question with him: he askt me of what parentage I was; I told him of as good as he, so he laugh'd and let mee goe. But what talke wee of Fathers, when there is such a man as Orlando? O that's a braue man, hee writes braue verses, speakes braue words, sweares braue oathes, and breakes them brauely, quite trauers athwart the heart of his louer, as a puisny Tilter, y spurs his horse but on one side, breakes his staffe like a noble goose; but all's braue that youth mounts, and folly guides: who comes heere? Mistresse and Master, you haue oft enquired After the Shepheard that complain'd of loue, Who you saw sitting by me on the Turph, Praising the proud disdainfull Shepherdesse That was his Mistresse Well: and what of him? If you will see a pageant truely plaid Betweene the pale complexion of true Loue, And the red glowe of scorne and prowd disdaine, Goe hence a little, and I shall conduct you If you will marke it O come, let vs remoue, The sight of Louers feedeth those in loue: Bring vs to this sight, and you shall say Ile proue a busie actor in their play. Scena Quinta. Sweet Phebe doe not scorne me, do not Phebe Say that you loue me not, but say not so In bitternesse; the common executioner Whose heart th' accustom'd sight of death makes hard Falls not the axe vpon the humbled neck, But first begs pardon: will you sterner be Then he that dies and liues by bloody drops? I would not be thy executioner, I flye thee, for I would not iniure thee: Thou tellst me there is murder in mine eye, 'Tis pretty sure, and very probable, That eyes that are the frailst, and softest things, Who shut their coward gates on atomyes, Should be called tyrants, butchers, murtherers. Now I doe frowne on thee with all my heart, And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee: Now counterfeit to swound, why now fall downe, Or if thou canst not, oh for shame, for shame, Lye not, to say mine eyes are murtherers: Now shew the wound mine eye hath made in thee, Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remaines Some scarre of it: Leane vpon a rush The Cicatrice and capable impressure Thy palme some moment keepes: but now mine eyes Which I haue darted at thee, hurt thee not, Nor I am sure there is no force in eyes That can doe hurt O deere Phebe, If euer (as that euer may be neere) You meet in some fresh cheeke the power of fancie, Then shall you know the wounds inuisible That Loues keene arrows make But till that time Come not thou neere me: and when that time comes, Afflict me with thy mockes, pitty me not, As till that time I shall not pitty thee And why I pray you? who might be your mother That you insult, exult, and all at once Ouer the wretched? what though you haue no beauty As by my faith, I see no more in you Then without Candle may goe darke to bed: Must you be therefore prowd and pittilesse? Why what meanes this? why do you looke on me? I see no more in you then in the ordinary Of Natures sale-worke? 'ods my little life, I thinke she meanes to tangle my eies too: No faith proud Mistresse, hope not after it, 'Tis not your inkie browes, your blacke silke haire, Your bugle eye-balls, nor your cheeke of creame That can entame my spirits to your worship: You foolish Shepheard, wherefore do you follow her Like foggy South, puffing with winde and raine, You are a thousand times a properer man Then she a woman. 'Tis such fooles as you That makes the world full of ill-fauourd children: 'Tis not her glasse, but you that flatters her, And out of you she sees her selfe more proper Then any of her lineaments can show her: But Mistris, know your selfe, downe on your knees And thanke heauen, fasting, for a good mans loue; For I must tell you friendly in your eare, Sell when you can, you are not for all markets: Cry the man mercy, loue him, take his offer, Foule is most foule, being foule to be a scoffer. So take her to thee Shepheard, fareyouwell Sweet youth, I pray you chide a yere together, I had rather here you chide, then this man wooe Hees falne in loue with your foulnesse, & shee'll Fall in loue with my anger. If it be so, as fast As she answeres thee with frowning lookes, ile sauce Her with bitter words: why looke you so vpon me? For no ill will I beare you I pray you do not fall in loue with mee, For I am falser then vowes made in wine: Besides, I like you not: if you will know my house, 'Tis at the tufft of Oliues, here hard by: Will you goe Sister? Shepheard ply her hard: Come Sister: Shepheardesse, looke on him better And be not proud, though all the world could see, None could be so abus'd in sight as hee. Come, to our flocke, Dead Shepheard, now I find thy saw of might, Who euer lov'd, that lou'd not at first sight? Sweet Phebe Hah: what saist thou Siluius? Sweet Phebe pitty me Why I am sorry for thee gentle Siluius Where euer sorrow is, reliefe would be: If you doe sorrow at my griefe in loue, By giuing loue your sorrow, and my griefe Were both extermin'd Thou hast my loue, is not that neighbourly? I would haue you Why that were couetousnesse: Siluius; the time was, that I hated thee; And yet it is not, that I beare thee loue, But since that thou canst talke of loue so well, Thy company, which erst was irkesome to me I will endure; and Ile employ thee too: But doe not looke for further recompence Then thine owne gladnesse, that thou art employd So holy, and so perfect is my loue, And I in such a pouerty of grace, That I shall thinke it a most plenteous crop To gleane the broken eares after the man That the maine haruest reapes: loose now and then A scattred smile, and that Ile liue vpon Knowst thou the youth that spoke to mee yerewhile? Not very well, but I haue met him oft, And he hath bought the Cottage and the bounds That the old Carlot once was Master of Thinke not I loue him, though I ask for him, 'Tis but a peeuish boy, yet he talkes well, But what care I for words? yet words do well When he that speakes them pleases those that heare: It is a pretty youth, not very prettie, But sure hee's proud, and yet his pride becomes him; Hee'll make a proper man: the best thing in him Is his complexion: and faster then his tongue Did make offence, his eye did heale it vp: He is not very tall, yet for his yeeres hee's tall: His leg is but so so, and yet 'tis well: There was a pretty rednesse in his lip, A little riper, and more lustie red Then that mixt in his cheeke: 'twas iust the difference Betwixt the constant red, and mingled Damaske. There be some women Siluius, had they markt him In parcells as I did, would haue gone neere To fall in loue with him: but for my part I loue him not, nor hate him not: and yet Haue more cause to hate him then to loue him, For what had he to doe to chide at me? He said mine eyes were black, and my haire blacke, And now I am remembred, scorn'd at me: I maruell why I answer'd not againe, But that's all one: omittance is no quittance: Ile write to him a very tanting Letter, And thou shalt beare it, wilt thou Siluius? Phebe, with all my heart Ile write it strait: The matter's in my head, and in my heart, I will be bitter with him, and passing short; Goe with me Siluius. I prethee, pretty youth, let me better acquainted with thee Ros They say you are a melancholly fellow I am so: I doe loue it better then laughing Those that are in extremity of either, are abhominable fellowes, and betray themselues to euery moderne censure, worse then drunkards Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing Why then 'tis good to be a poste I haue neither the Schollers melancholy, which is emulation: nor the Musitians, which is fantasticall; nor the Courtiers, which is proud: nor the Souldiers, which is ambitious: nor the Lawiers, which is politick: nor the Ladies, which is nice: nor the Louers, which is all these: but it is a melancholy of mine owne, compounded of many simples, extracted from many obiects, and indeed the sundrie contemplation of my trauells, in which by often rumination, wraps me in a most humorous sadnesse A Traueller: by my faith you haue great reason to be sad: I feare you haue sold your owne Lands, to see other mens; then to haue seene much, and to haue nothing, is to haue rich eyes and poore hands Yes, I haue gain'd my experience. And your experience makes you sad: I had rather haue a foole to make me merrie, then experience to make me sad, and to trauaile for it too Good day, and happinesse, deere Rosalind Nay then God buy you, and you talke in blanke verse Farewell Mounsieur Trauellor: looke you lispe, and weare strange suites; disable all the benefits of your owne Countrie: be out of loue with your natiuitie, and almost chide God for making you that countenance you are; or I will scarce thinke you haue swam in a Gundello. Why how now Orlando, where haue you bin all this while? you a louer? and you serue me such another tricke, neuer come in my sight more My faire Rosalind, I come within an houre of my promise Breake an houres promise in loue? hee that will diuide a minute into a thousand parts, and breake but a part of the thousand part of a minute in the affairs of loue, it may be said of him that Cupid hath clapt him oth' shoulder, but Ile warrant him heart hole Pardon me deere Rosalind Nay, and you be so tardie, come no more in my sight, I had as liefe be woo'd of a Snaile Of a Snaile? I, of a Snaile: for though he comes slowly, hee carries his house on his head; a better ioyncture I thinke then you make a woman: besides, he brings his destinie with him What's that? Why hornes: w such as you are faine to be beholding to your wiues for: but he comes armed in his fortune, and preuents the slander of his wife Vertue is no horne-maker: and my Rosalind is vertuous And I am your Rosalind It pleases him to call you so: but he hath a Rosalind of a better leere then you Come, wooe me, wooe mee: for now I am in a holy-day humor, and like enough to consent: What would you say to me now, and I were your verie, verie Rosalind? I would kisse before I spoke Nay, you were better speake first, and when you were grauel'd, for lacke of matter, you might take occasion to kisse: verie good Orators when they are out, they will spit, and for louers, lacking (God warne vs) matter, the cleanliest shift is to kisse How if the kisse be denide? Then she puts you to entreatie, and there begins new matter Who could be out, being before his beloued Mistris? Marrie that should you if I were your Mistris, or I should thinke my honestie ranker then my wit What, of my suite? Not out of your apparrell, and yet out of your suite: Am not I your Rosalind? I take some ioy to say you are, because I would be talking of her Well, in her person, I say I will not haue you Then in mine owne person, I die No faith, die by Attorney: the poore world is almost six thousand yeeres old, and in all this time there was not anie man died in his owne person (videlicet) in a loue cause: Troilous had his braines dash'd out with a Grecian club, yet he did what hee could to die before, and he is one of the patternes of loue. Leander, he would haue liu'd manie a faire yeere though Hero had turn'd Nun; if it had not bin for a hot Midsomer-night, for (good youth) he went but forth to wash him in the Hellespont, and being taken with the crampe, was droun'd, and the foolish Chronoclers of that age, found it was Hero of Cestos. But these are all lies, men haue died from time to time, and wormes haue eaten them, but not for loue I would not haue my right Rosalind of this mind, for I protest her frowne might kill me By this hand, it will not kill a flie: but come, now I will be your Rosalind in a more comming-on disposition: and aske me what you will, I will grant it Then loue me Rosalind Yes faith will I, fridaies and saterdaies, and all And wilt thou haue me? I, and twentie such What saiest thou? Are you not good? I hope so Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing: Come sister, you shall be the Priest, and marrie vs: giue me your hand Orlando: What doe you say sister? Pray thee marrie vs I cannot say the words You must begin, will you Orlando Goe too: wil you Orlando, haue to wife this Rosalind? I will I, but when? Why now, as fast as she can marrie vs Then you must say, I take thee Rosalind for wife I take thee Rosalind for wife I might aske you for your Commission, But I doe take thee Orlando for my husband: there's a girle goes before the Priest, and certainely a Womans thought runs before her actions So do all thoughts, they are wing'd Now tell me how long you would haue her, after you haue possest her? For euer, and a day Say a day, without the euer: no, no Orlando, men are Aprill when they woe, December when they wed: Maides are May when they are maides, but the sky changes when they are wiues: I will bee more iealous of thee, then a Barbary cocke-pidgeon ouer his hen, more clamorous then a Parrat against raine, more new-fangled then an ape, more giddy in my desires, then a monkey: I will weepe for nothing, like Diana in the Fountaine, & I wil do that when you are dispos'd to be merry: I will laugh like a Hyen, and that when thou art inclin'd to sleepe But will my Rosalind doe so? By my life, she will doe as I doe O but she is wise Or else shee could not haue the wit to doe this: the wiser, the waywarder: make the doores vpon a womans wit, and it will out at the casement: shut that, and 'twill out at the key-hole: stop that, 'twill flie with the smoake out at the chimney A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say, wit whether wil't? Nay, you might keepe that checke for it, till you met your wiues wit going to your neighbours bed And what wit could wit haue, to excuse that? Marry to say, she came to seeke you there: you shall neuer take her without her answer, vnlesse you take her without her tongue: o that woman that cannot make her fault her husbands occasion, let her neuer nurse her childe her selfe, for she will breed it like a foole For these two houres Rosalinde, I wil leaue thee Alas, deere loue, I cannot lacke thee two houres I must attend the Duke at dinner, by two a clock I will be with thee againe I, goe your waies, goe your waies: I knew what you would proue, my friends told mee as much, and I thought no lesse: that flattering tongue of yours wonne me: 'tis but one cast away, and so come death: two o' clocke is your howre I, sweet Rosalind By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend mee, and by all pretty oathes that are not dangerous, if you breake one iot of your promise, or come one minute behinde your houre, I will thinke you the most patheticall breake-promise, and the most hollow louer, and the most vnworthy of her you call Rosalinde, that may bee chosen out of the grosse band of the vnfaithfull: therefore beware my censure, and keep your promise With no lesse religion, then if thou wert indeed my Rosalind: so adieu Well, Time is the olde Iustice that examines all such offenders, and let time try: adieu. You haue simply misus'd our sexe in your loue-prate: we must haue your doublet and hose pluckt ouer your head, and shew the world what the bird hath done to her owne neast O coz, coz, coz: my pretty little coz, that thou didst know how many fathome deepe I am in loue: but it cannot bee sounded: my affection hath an vnknowne bottome, like the Bay of Portugall Or rather bottomlesse, that as fast as you poure affection in, it runs out No, that same wicked Bastard of Venus, that was begot of thought, conceiu'd of spleene, and borne of madnesse, that blinde rascally boy, that abuses euery ones eyes, because his owne are out, let him bee iudge, how deepe I am in loue: ile tell thee Aliena, I cannot be out of the sight of Orlando: Ile goe finde a shadow, and sigh till he come And Ile sleepe. Scena Secunda. Which is he that killed the Deare? Sir, it was I Let's present him to the Duke like a Romane Conquerour, and it would doe well to set the Deares horns vpon his head, for a branch of victory; haue you no song Forrester for this purpose? Yes Sir Sing it: 'tis no matter how it bee in tune, so it make noyse enough. Musicke, Song. What shall he haue that kild the Deare? His Leather skin, and hornes to weare: Then sing him home, the rest shall beare this burthen; Take thou no scorne to weare the horne, It was a crest ere thou wast borne, Thy fathers father wore it, And thy father bore it, The horne, the horne, the lusty horne, Is not a thing to laugh to scorne. Scoena Tertia. How say you now, is it not past two a clock? And heere much Orlando I warrant you, with pure loue, & troubled brain, He hath t'ane his bow and arrowes, and is gone forth To sleepe: looke who comes heere My errand is to you, faire youth, My gentle Phebe, did bid me giue you this: I know not the contents, but as I guesse By the sterne brow, and waspish action Which she did vse, as she was writing of it, It beares an angry tenure; pardon me, I am but as a guiltlesse messenger Patience her selfe would startle at this letter, And play the swaggerer, beare this, beare all: Shee saies I am not faire, that I lacke manners, She calls me proud, and that she could not loue me Were man as rare as Phenix: 'od's my will, Her loue is not the Hare that I doe hunt, Why writes she so to me? well Shepheard, well, This is a Letter of your owne deuice No, I protest, I know not the contents, Phebe did write it Come, come, you are a foole, And turn'd into the extremity of loue. I saw her hand, she has a leatherne hand, A freestone coloured hand: I verily did thinke That her old gloues were on, but twas her hands: She has a huswiues hand, but that's no matter: I say she neuer did inuent this letter, This is a mans inuention, and his hand Sure it is hers Why, tis a boysterous and a cruell stile, A stile for challengers: why, she defies me, Like Turke to Christian: womens gentle braine Could not drop forth such giant rude inuention, Such Ethiop words, blacker in their effect Then in their countenance: will you heare the letter? So please you, for I neuer heard it yet: Yet heard too much of Phebes crueltie She Phebes me: marke how the tyrant writes. Art thou god, to Shepherd turn'd? That a maidens heart hath burn'd. Can a woman raile thus? Call you this railing? Why, thy godhead laid a part, War'st thou with a womans heart? Did you euer heare such railing? Whiles the eye of man did wooe me, That could do no vengeance to me. Meaning me a beast. If the scorne of your bright eine Haue power to raise such loue in mine, Alacke, in me, what strange effect Would they worke in milde aspect? Whiles you chid me, I did loue, How then might your praiers moue? He that brings this loue to thee, Little knowes this Loue in me: And by him seale vp thy minde, Whether that thy youth and kinde Will the faithfull offer take Of me, and all that I can make, Or else by him my loue denie, And then Ile studie how to die Call you this chiding? Alas poore Shepheard Doe you pitty him? No, he deserues no pitty: wilt thou loue such a woman? what to make thee an instrument, and play false straines vpon thee? not to be endur'd. Well, goe your way to her; (for I see Loue hath made thee a tame snake) and say this to her; That if she loue me, I charge her to loue thee: if she will not, I will neuer haue her, vnlesse thou intreat for her: if you bee a true louer hence, and not a word; for here comes more company. Good morrow, faire ones: pray you, (if you | know) Where in the Purlews of this Forrest, stands A sheep-coat, fenc'd about with Oliue-trees West of this place, down in the neighbor bottom The ranke of Oziers, by the murmuring streame Left on your right hand, brings you to the place: But at this howre, the house doth keepe it selfe, There's none within If that an eye may profit by a tongue, Then should I know you by description, Such garments, and such yeeres: the boy is faire, Of femall fauour, and bestowes himselfe Like a ripe sister: the woman low And browner then her brother: are not you The owner of the house I did enquire for? It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are Orlando doth commend him to you both, And to that youth hee calls his Rosalind, He sends this bloudy napkin; are you he? I am: what must we vnderstand by this? Some of my shame, if you will know of me What man I am, and how, and why, and where This handkercher was stain'd I pray you tell it When last the yong Orlando parted from you, He left a promise to returne againe Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancie, Loe what befell: he threw his eye aside, And marke what obiect did present it selfe Vnder an old Oake, whose bows were moss'd with age And high top, bald with drie antiquitie: A wretched ragged man, ore-growne with haire Lay sleeping on his back; about his necke A greene and guilded snake had wreath'd it selfe, Who with her head, nimble in threats approach'd The opening of his mouth: but sodainly Seeing Orlando, it vnlink'd it selfe, And with indented glides, did slip away Into a bush, vnder which bushes shade A Lyonnesse, with vdders all drawne drie, Lay cowching head on ground, with catlike watch When that the sleeping man should stirre; for 'tis The royall disposition of that beast To prey on nothing, that doth seeme as dead: This seene, Orlando did approach the man, And found it was his brother, his elder brother O I haue heard him speake of that same brother, And he did render him the most vnnaturall That liu'd amongst men And well he might so doe, For well I know he was vnnaturall But to Orlando: did he leaue him there Food to the suck'd and hungry Lyonnesse? Twice did he turne his backe, and purpos'd so: But kindnesse, nobler euer then reuenge, And Nature stronger then his iust occasion, Made him giue battell to the Lyonnesse: Who quickly fell before him, in which hurtling From miserable slumber I awaked Are you his brother? Was't you he rescu'd? Was't you that did so oft contriue to kill him? 'Twas I: but 'tis not I: I doe not shame To tell you what I was, since my conuersion So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am But for the bloody napkin? By and by: When from the first to last betwixt vs two, Teares our recountments had most kindely bath'd, As how I came into that Desert place. In briefe, he led me to the gentle Duke, Who gaue me fresh aray, and entertainment, Committing me vnto my brothers loue, Who led me instantly vnto his Caue, There stript himselfe, and heere vpon his arme The Lyonnesse had torne some flesh away, Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted, And cride in fainting vpon Rosalinde. Briefe, I recouer'd him, bound vp his wound, And after some small space, being strong at heart, He sent me hither, stranger as I am To tell this story, that you might excuse His broken promise, and to giue this napkin Died in this bloud, vnto the Shepheard youth, That he in sport doth call his Rosalind Why how now Ganimed, sweet Ganimed Many will swoon when they do look on bloud There is more in it; Cosen Ganimed Looke, he recouers I would I were at home Wee'll lead you thither: I pray you will you take him by the arme Be of good cheere youth: you a man? You lacke a mans heart I doe so, I confesse it: Ah, sirra, a body would thinke this was well counterfeited, I pray you tell your brother how well I counterfeited: heigh-ho This was not counterfeit, there is too great testimony in your complexion, that it was a passion of earnest Counterfeit, I assure you Well then, take a good heart, and counterfeit to be a man So I doe: but yfaith, I should haue beene a woman by right Come, you looke paler and paler: pray you draw homewards: good sir, goe with vs That will I: for I must beare answere backe How you excuse my brother, Rosalind I shall deuise something: but I pray you commend my counterfeiting to him: will you goe? We shall finde a time Awdrie, patience gentle Awdrie Faith the Priest was good enough, for all the olde gentlemans saying A most wicked Sir Oliuer, Awdrie, a most vile Mar-text. But Awdrie, there is a youth heere in the Forrest layes claime to you I, I know who 'tis: he hath no interest in mee in the world: here comes the man you meane. It is meat and drinke to me to see a Clowne, by my troth, we that haue good wits, haue much to answer for: we shall be flouting: we cannot hold Good eu'n Audrey God ye good eu'n William And good eu'n to you Sir Good eu'n gentle friend. Couer thy head, couer thy head: Nay prethee bee couer'd. How olde are you Friend? Fiue and twentie Sir A ripe age: Is thy name William? William, sir A faire name. Was't borne i'th Forrest heere? I sir, I thanke God Thanke God: A good answer: Art rich? 'Faith sir, so, so So, so, is good, very good, very excellent good: and yet it is not, it is but so, so: Art thou wise? I sir, I haue a prettie wit Why, thou saist well. I do now remember a saying: The Foole doth thinke he is wise, but the wiseman knowes himselfe to be a Foole. The Heathen Philosopher, when he had a desire to eate a Grape, would open his lips when he put it into his mouth, meaning thereby, that Grapes were made to eate, and lippes to open. You do loue this maid? I do sir Giue me your hand: Art thou Learned? No sir Then learne this of me, To haue, is to haue. For it is a figure in Rhetoricke, that drink being powr'd out of a cup into a glasse, by filling the one, doth empty the other. For all your Writers do consent, that ipse is hee: now you are not ipse, for I am he Which he sir? He sir, that must marrie this woman: Therefore you Clowne, abandon: which is in the vulgar, leaue the societie: which in the boorish, is companie, of this female: which in the common, is woman: which together, is, abandon the society of this Female, or Clowne thou perishest: or to thy better vnderstanding, dyest; or (to wit) I kill thee, make thee away, translate thy life into death, thy libertie into bondage: I will deale in poyson with thee, or in bastinado, or in steele: I will bandy with thee in faction, I will ore-run thee with policie: I will kill thee a hundred and fifty wayes, therefore tremble and depart Do good William God rest you merry sir. Our Master and Mistresse seekes you: come away, away Trip Audry, trip Audry, I attend, I attend. Scoena Secunda. Is't possible, that on so little acquaintance you should like her? that, but seeing, you should loue her? And louing woo? and wooing, she should graunt? And will you perseuer to enioy her? Neither call the giddinesse of it in question; the pouertie of her, the small acquaintance, my sodaine woing, nor sodaine consenting: but say with mee, I loue Aliena: say with her, that she loues mee; consent with both, that we may enioy each other: it shall be to your good: for my fathers house, and all the reuennew, that was old Sir Rowlands will I estate vpon you, and heere liue and die a Shepherd. You haue my consent. Let your Wedding be to morrow: thither will I Inuite the Duke, and all's contented followers: Go you, and prepare Aliena; for looke you, Heere comes my Rosalinde God saue you brother And you faire sister Oh my deere Orlando, how it greeues me to see thee weare thy heart in a scarfe It is my arme I thought thy heart had beene wounded with the clawes of a Lion Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a Lady Did your brother tell you how I counterfeyted to sound, when he shew'd me your handkercher? I, and greater wonders then that O, I know where you are: nay, tis true: there was neuer any thing so sodaine, but the sight of two Rammes, and Cesars Thrasonicall bragge of I came, saw, and ouercome. For your brother, and my sister, no sooner met, but they look'd: no sooner look'd, but they lou'd; no sooner lou'd, but they sigh'd: no sooner sigh'd but they ask'd one another the reason: no sooner knew the reason, but they sought the remedie: and in these degrees, haue they made a paire of staires to marriage, which they will climbe incontinent, or else bee incontinent before marriage; they are in the verie wrath of loue, and they will together. Clubbes cannot part them They shall be married to morrow: and I will bid the Duke to the Nuptiall. But O, how bitter a thing it is, to looke into happines through another mans eies: by so much the more shall I to morrow be at the height of heart heauinesse, by how much I shal thinke my brother happie, in hauing what he wishes for Why then to morrow, I cannot serue your turne for Rosalind? I can liue no longer by thinking I will wearie you then no longer with idle talking. Know of me then (for now I speake to some purpose) that I know you are a Gentleman of good conceit: I speake not this, that you should beare a good opinion of my knowledge: insomuch (I say) I know you are: neither do I labor for a greater esteeme then may in some little measure draw a beleefe from you, to do your selfe good, and not to grace me. Beleeue then, if you please, that I can do strange things: I haue since I was three yeare old conuerst with a Magitian, most profound in his Art, and yet not damnable. If you do loue Rosalinde so neere the hart, as your gesture cries it out: when your brother marries Aliena, shall you marrie her. I know into what straights of Fortune she is driuen, and it is not impossible to me, if it appeare not inconuenient to you, to set her before your eyes to morrow, humane as she is, and without any danger Speak'st thou in sober meanings? By my life I do, which I tender deerly, though I say I am a Magitian: Therefore put you in your best aray, bid your friends: for if you will be married to morrow, you shall: and to Rosalind if you will. Looke, here comes a Louer of mine, and a louer of hers Youth, you haue done me much vngentlenesse, To shew the letter that I writ to you I care not if I haue: it is my studie To seeme despightfull and vngentle to you: you are there followed by a faithful shepheard, Looke vpon him, loue him: he worships you Good shepheard, tell this youth what 'tis to loue It is to be all made of sighes and teares, And so am I for Phebe And I for Ganimed And I for Rosalind And I for no woman It is to be all made of faith and seruice, And so am I for Phebe And I for Ganimed And I for Rosalind And I for no woman It is to be all made of fantasie, All made of passion, and all made of wishes, All adoration, dutie, and obseruance, All humblenesse, all patience, and impatience, All puritie, all triall, all obseruance: And so am I for Phebe And so am I for Ganimed And so am I for Rosalind And so am I for no woman If this be so, why blame you me to loue you? If this be so, why blame you me to loue you? If this be so, why blame you me to loue you? Why do you speake too, Why blame you mee to loue you To her, that is not heere, nor doth not heare Pray you no more of this, 'tis like the howling of Irish Wolues against the Moone: I will helpe you if I can: I would loue you if I could: To morrow meet me altogether: I wil marrie you, if euer I marrie Woman, and Ile be married to morrow: I will satisfie you, if euer I satisfi'd man, and you shall bee married to morrow. I wil content you, if what pleases you contents you, and you shal be married to morrow: As you loue Rosalind meet, as you loue Phebe meet, and as I loue no woman, Ile meet: so fare you wel: I haue left you commands Ile not faile, if I liue Nor I Nor I. Scoena Tertia. To morrow is the ioyfull day Audrey, to morow will we be married I do desire it with all my heart: and I hope it is no dishonest desire, to desire to be a woman of y world? Heere come two of the banish'd Dukes Pages. 1.Pa. Wel met honest Gentleman By my troth well met: come, sit, sit, and a song 2.Pa. We are for you, sit i'th middle 1.Pa. Shal we clap into't roundly, without hauking, or spitting, or saying we are hoarse, which are the onely prologues to a bad voice 2.Pa. I faith, y'faith, and both in a tune like two gipsies on a horse. It was a Louer, and his lasse, With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino, That o're the greene corne feild did passe, In the spring time, the onely pretty rang time. When Birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding. Sweet Louers loue the spring, And therefore take the present time. With a hey, & a ho, and a hey nonino, For loue is crowned with the prime. In spring time, &c. Betweene the acres of the Rie, With a hey, and a ho, & a hey nonino: These prettie Country folks would lie. In spring time, &c. This Carroll they began that houre, With a hey and a ho, & a hey nonino: How that a life was but a Flower, In spring time, &c Truly yong Gentlemen, though there was no great matter in the dittie, yet y note was very vntunable 1.Pa. you are deceiu'd Sir, we kept time, we lost not our time By my troth yes: I count it but time lost to heare such a foolish song. God buy you, and God mend your voices. Come Audrie. Scena Quarta. Sen. Dost thou beleeue Orlando, that the boy Can do all this that he hath promised? I sometimes do beleeue, and somtimes do not, As those that feare they hope, and know they feare. Patience once more, whiles our copact is vrg'd: You say, if I bring in your Rosalinde, You wil bestow her on Orlando heere? Se. That would I, had I kingdoms to giue with hir And you say you wil haue her, when I bring hir? That would I, were I of all kingdomes King You say, you'l marrie me, if I be willing That will I, should I die the houre after But if you do refuse to marrie me, You'l giue your selfe to this most faithfull Shepheard So is the bargaine You say that you'l haue Phebe if she will Though to haue her and death, were both one thing I haue promis'd to make all this matter euen: Keepe you your word, O Duke, to giue your daughter, You yours Orlando, to receiue his daughter: Keepe you your word Phebe, that you'l marrie me, Or else refusing me to wed this shepheard: Keepe your word Siluius, that you'l marrie her If she refuse me, and from hence I go To make these doubts all euen. Sen. I do remember in this shepheard boy, Some liuely touches of my daughters fauour My Lord, the first time that I euer saw him, Me thought he was a brother to your daughter: But my good Lord, this Boy is Forrest borne, And hath bin tutor'd in the rudiments Of many desperate studies, by his vnckle, Whom he reports to be a great Magitian. Obscured in the circle of this Forrest There is sure another flood toward, and these couples are comming to the Arke. Here comes a payre of verie strange beasts, which in all tongues, are call'd Fooles Salutation and greeting to you all Good my Lord, bid him welcome: This is the Motley-minded Gentleman, that I haue so often met in the Forrest: he hath bin a Courtier he sweares If any man doubt that, let him put mee to my purgation, I haue trod a measure, I haue flattred a Lady, I haue bin politicke with my friend, smooth with mine enemie, I haue vndone three Tailors, I haue had foure quarrels, and like to haue fought one And how was that tane vp? 'Faith we met, and found the quarrel was vpon the seuenth cause How seuenth cause? Good my Lord, like this fellow Se. I like him very well God'ild you sir, I desire you of the like: I presse in heere sir, amongst the rest of the Country copulatiues to sweare, and to forsweare, according as mariage binds and blood breakes: a poore virgin sir, an il-fauor'd thing sir, but mine owne, a poore humour of mine sir, to take that that no man else will: rich honestie dwels like a miser sir, in a poore house, as your Pearle in your foule oyster Se. By my faith, he is very swift, and sententious According to the fooles bolt sir, and such dulcet diseases But for the seuenth cause. How did you finde the quarrell on the seuenth cause? Vpon a lye, seuen times remoued: (beare your bodie more seeming Audry) as thus sir: I did dislike the cut of a certaine Courtiers beard: he sent me word, if I said his beard was not cut well, hee was in the minde it was: this is call'd the retort courteous. If I sent him word againe, it was not well cut, he wold send me word he cut it to please himselfe: this is call'd the quip modest. If againe, it was not well cut, he disabled my iudgment: this is called, the reply churlish. If againe it was not well cut, he would answer I spake not true: this is call'd the reproofe valiant. If againe, it was not well cut, he wold say, I lie: this is call'd the counter-checke quarrelsome: and so to lye circumstantiall, and the lye direct And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut? I durst go no further then the lye circumstantial: nor he durst not giue me the lye direct: and so wee measur'd swords, and parted Can you nominate in order now, the degrees of the lye O sir, we quarrel in print, by the booke: as you haue bookes for good manners: I will name you the degrees. The first, the Retort courteous: the second, the Quip-modest: the third, the reply Churlish: the fourth, the Reproofe valiant: the fift, the Counterchecke quarrelsome: the sixt, the Lye with circumstance: the seauenth, the Lye direct: all these you may auoyd, but the Lye direct: and you may auoide that too, with an If. I knew when seuen Iustices could not take vp a Quarrell, but when the parties were met themselues, one of them thought but of an If; as if you saide so, then I saide so: and they shooke hands, and swore brothers. Your If, is the onely peace-maker: much vertue in if Is not this a rare fellow my Lord? He's as good at any thing, and yet a foole Se. He vses his folly like a stalking-horse, and vnder the presentation of that he shoots his wit. Still Musicke. Then is there mirth in heauen, When earthly things made eauen attone together. Good Duke receiue thy daughter, Hymen from Heauen brought her, Yea brought her hether. That thou mightst ioyne his hand with his, Whose heart within his bosome is To you I giue my selfe, for I am yours. To you I giue my selfe, for I am yours Se. If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind If sight & shape be true, why then my loue adieu Ile haue no Father, if you be not he: Ile haue no Husband, if you be not he: Nor ne're wed woman, if you be not shee Peace hoa: I barre confusion, 'Tis I must make conclusion Of these most strange euents: Here's eight that must take hands, To ioyne in Hymens bands, If truth holds true contents. You and you, no crosse shall part; You and you, are hart in hart: You, to his loue must accord, Or haue a Woman to your Lord. You and you, are sure together, As the Winter to fowle Weather: Whiles a Wedlocke Hymne we sing, Feede your selues with questioning: That reason, wonder may diminish How thus we met, and these things finish. Wedding is great Iunos crowne, O blessed bond of boord and bed: 'Tis Hymen peoples euerie towne, High wedlock then be honored: Honor, high honor and renowne To Hymen, God of euerie Towne Se. O my deere Neece, welcome thou art to me, Euen daughter welcome, in no lesse degree I wil not eate my word, now thou art mine, Thy faith, my fancie to thee doth combine. 2.Bro. Let me haue audience for a word or two: I am the second sonne of old Sir Rowland, That bring these tidings to this faire assembly. Duke Frederick hearing how that euerie day Men of great worth resorted to this forrest, Addrest a mightie power, which were on foote In his owne conduct, purposely to take His brother heere, and put him to the sword: And to the skirts of this wilde Wood he came; Where, meeting with an old Religious man, After some question with him, was conuerted Both from his enterprize, and from the world: His crowne bequeathing to his banish'd Brother, And all their Lands restor'd to him againe That were with him exil'd. This to be true, I do engage my life Se. Welcome yong man: Thou offer'st fairely to thy brothers wedding: To one his lands with-held, and to the other A land it selfe at large, a potent Dukedome. First, in this Forrest, let vs do those ends That heere were well begun, and wel begot: And after, euery of this happie number That haue endur'd shrew'd daies, and nights with vs, Shal share the good of our returned fortune, According to the measure of their states. Meane time, forget this new-falne dignitie, And fall into our Rusticke Reuelrie: Play Musicke, and you Brides and Bride-groomes all, With measure heap'd in ioy, to'th Measures fall Sir, by your patience: if I heard you rightly, The Duke hath put on a Religious life, And throwne into neglect the pompous Court 2.Bro. He hath To him will I: out of these conuertites, There is much matter to be heard, and learn'd: you to your former Honor, I bequeath your patience, and your vertue, well deserues it. you to a loue, that your true faith doth merit: you to your land, and loue, and great allies: you to a long, and well-deserued bed: And you to wrangling, for thy louing voyage Is but for two moneths victuall'd: So to your pleasures, I am for other, then for dancing meazures Se. Stay, Iaques, stay To see no pastime, I: what you would haue, Ile stay to know, at your abandon'd caue. Se. Proceed, proceed: wee'l begin these rights, As we do trust, they'l end in true delights. It is not the fashion to see the Ladie the Epilogue: but it is no more vnhandsome, then to see the Lord the Prologue. If it be true, that good wine needs no bush, 'tis true, that a good play needes no Epilogue. Yet to good wine they do vse good bushes: and good playes proue the better by the helpe of good Epilogues: What a case am I in then, that am neither a good Epilogue, nor cannot insinuate with you in the behalfe of a good play? I am not furnish'd like a Begger, therefore to begge will not become mee. My way is to coniure you, and Ile begin with the Women. I charge you (O women) for the loue you beare to men, to like as much of this Play, as please you: And I charge you (O men) for the loue you beare to women (as I perceiue by your simpring, none of you hates them) that betweene you, and the women, the play may please. If I were a Woman, I would kisse as many of you as had beards that pleas'd me, complexions that lik'd me, and breaths that I defi'de not: And I am sure, as many as haue good beards, or good faces, or sweet breaths, will for my kind offer, when I make curt'sie, bid me farewell. Who's there? Nay answer me: Stand & vnfold your selfe Long liue the King Barnardo? He You come most carefully vpon your houre 'Tis now strook twelue, get thee to bed Francisco For this releefe much thankes: 'Tis bitter cold, And I am sicke at heart Haue you had quiet Guard? Not a Mouse stirring Well, goodnight. If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus, the Riuals of my Watch, bid them make hast. I thinke I heare them. Stand: who's there? Friends to this ground And Leige-men to the Dane Giue you good night O farwel honest Soldier, who hath relieu'd you? Barnardo ha's my place: giue you goodnight. Holla Barnardo Say, what is Horatio there? A peece of him Welcome Horatio, welcome good Marcellus What, ha's this thing appear'd againe to night I haue seene nothing Horatio saies, 'tis but our Fantasie, And will not let beleefe take hold of him Touching this dreaded sight, twice seene of vs, Therefore I haue intreated him along With vs, to watch the minutes of this Night, That if againe this Apparition come, He may approue our eyes, and speake to it Tush, tush, 'twill not appeare Sit downe a-while, And let vs once againe assaile your eares, That are so fortified against our Story, What we two Nights haue seene Well, sit we downe, And let vs heare Barnardo speake of this Last night of all, When yond same Starre that's Westward from the Pole Had made his course t' illume that part of Heauen Where now it burnes, Marcellus and my selfe, The Bell then beating one Peace, breake thee of: Looke where it comes againe In the same figure, like the King that's dead Thou art a Scholler; speake to it Horatio Lookes it not like the King? Marke it Horatio Most like: It harrowes me with fear & wonder It would be spoke too Question it Horatio What art thou that vsurp'st this time of night, Together with that Faire and Warlike forme In which the Maiesty of buried Denmarke Did sometimes march: By Heauen I charge thee speake It is offended See, it stalkes away Stay: speake; speake: I Charge thee, speake. 'Tis gone, and will not answer How now Horatio? You tremble & look pale: Is not this something more then Fantasie? What thinke you on't? Before my God, I might not this beleeue Without the sensible and true auouch Of mine owne eyes Is it not like the King? As thou art to thy selfe, Such was the very Armour he had on, When th' Ambitious Norwey combatted: So frown'd he once, when in an angry parle He smot the sledded Pollax on the Ice. 'Tis strange Thus twice before, and iust at this dead houre, With Martiall stalke, hath he gone by our Watch In what particular thought to work, I know not: But in the grosse and scope of my Opinion, This boades some strange erruption to our State Good now sit downe, & tell me he that knowes Why this same strict and most obseruant Watch, So nightly toyles the subiect of the Land, And why such dayly Cast of Brazon Cannon And Forraigne Mart for Implements of warre: Why such impresse of Ship-wrights, whose sore Taske Do's not diuide the Sunday from the weeke, What might be toward, that this sweaty hast Doth make the Night ioynt-Labourer with the day: Who is't that can informe me? That can I, At least the whisper goes so: Our last King, Whose Image euen but now appear'd to vs, Was (as you know) by Fortinbras of Norway, (Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate Pride) Dar'd to the Combate. In which, our Valiant Hamlet, (For so this side of our knowne world esteem'd him) Did slay this Fortinbras: who by a Seal'd Compact, Well ratified by Law, and Heraldrie, Did forfeite (with his life) all those his Lands Which he stood seiz'd on, to the Conqueror: Against the which, a Moity competent Was gaged by our King: which had return'd To the Inheritance of Fortinbras, Had he bin Vanquisher, as by the same Cou'nant And carriage of the Article designe, His fell to Hamlet. Now sir, young Fortinbras, Of vnimproued Mettle, hot and full, Hath in the skirts of Norway, heere and there, Shark'd vp a List of Landlesse Resolutes, For Foode and Diet, to some Enterprize That hath a stomacke in't: which is no other (And it doth well appeare vnto our State) But to recouer of vs by strong hand And termes Compulsatiue, those foresaid Lands So by his Father lost: and this (I take it) Is the maine Motiue of our Preparations, The Sourse of this our Watch, and the cheefe head Of this post-hast, and Romage in the Land. But soft, behold: Loe, where it comes againe: Ile crosse it, though it blast me. Stay Illusion: If thou hast any sound, or vse of Voyce, Speake to me. If there be any good thing to be done, That may to thee do ease, and grace to me; speak to me. If thou art priuy to thy Countries Fate (Which happily foreknowing may auoyd) Oh speake. Or, if thou hast vp-hoorded in thy life Extorted Treasure in the wombe of Earth, (For which, they say, you Spirits oft walke in death) Speake of it. Stay, and speake. Stop it Marcellus Shall I strike at it with my Partizan? Do, if it will not stand 'Tis heere 'Tis heere 'Tis gone. We do it wrong, being so Maiesticall To offer it the shew of Violence, For it is as the Ayre, invulnerable, And our vaine blowes, malicious Mockery It was about to speake, when the Cocke crew And then it started, like a guilty thing Vpon a fearfull Summons. I haue heard, The Cocke that is the Trumpet to the day, Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding Throate Awake the God of Day: and at his warning, Whether in Sea, or Fire, in Earth, or Ayre, Th' extrauagant, and erring Spirit, hyes To his Confine. And of the truth heerein, This present Obiect made probation It faded on the crowing of the Cocke. Some sayes, that euer 'gainst that Season comes Wherein our Sauiours Birch is celebrated, The Bird of Dawning singeth all night long: And then (they say) no Spirit can walke abroad, The nights are wholsome, then no Planets strike, No Faiery talkes, nor Witch hath power to Charme: So hallow'd, and so gracious is the time So haue I heard, and do in part beleeue it. But looke, the Morne in Russet mantle clad, Walkes o're the dew of yon high Easterne Hill, Breake we our Watch vp, and by my aduice Let vs impart what we haue seene to night Vnto yong Hamlet. For vpon my life, This Spirit dumbe to vs, will speake to him: Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it, As needfull in our Loues, fitting our Duty? Let do't I pray, and I this morning know Where we shall finde him most conueniently. Scena Secunda. Polonius, Laertes, and his Sister Ophelia, Lords Attendant. Though yet of Hamlet our deere Brothers death The memory be greene: and that it vs befitted To beare our hearts in greefe, and our whole Kingdome To be contracted in one brow of woe: Yet so farre hath Discretion fought with Nature, That we with wisest sorrow thinke on him, Together with remembrance of our selues. Therefore our sometimes Sister, now our Queene, Th' imperiall Ioyntresse of this warlike State, Haue we, as 'twere, with a defeated ioy, With one Auspicious, and one Dropping eye, With mirth in Funerall, and with Dirge in Marriage, In equall Scale weighing Delight and Dole Taken to Wife; nor haue we heerein barr'd Your better Wisedomes, which haue freely gone With this affaire along, for all our Thankes. Now followes, that you know young Fortinbras, Holding a weake supposall of our worth; Or thinking by our late deere Brothers death, Our State to be disioynt, and out of Frame, Colleagued with the dreame of his Aduantage; He hath not fayl'd to pester vs with Message, Importing the surrender of those Lands Lost by his Father: with all Bonds of Law To our most valiant Brother. So much for him. Now for our selfe, and for this time of meeting Thus much the businesse is. We haue heere writ To Norway, Vncle of young Fortinbras, Who Impotent and Bedrid, scarsely heares Of this his Nephewes purpose, to suppresse His further gate heerein. In that the Leuies, The Lists, and full proportions are all made Out of his subiect: and we heere dispatch You good Cornelius, and you Voltemand, For bearing of this greeting to old Norway, Giuing to you no further personall power To businesse with the King, more then the scope Of these dilated Articles allow: Farewell, and let your hast commend your duty In that, and all things, will we shew our duty We doubt it nothing, heartily farewell. And now Laertes, what's the newes with you? You told vs of some suite. What is't Laertes? You cannot speake of Reason to the Dane, And loose your voyce. What would'st thou beg Laertes, That shall not be my Offer, not thy Asking? The Head is not more Natiue to the Heart, The Hand more instrumentall to the Mouth, Then is the Throne of Denmarke to thy Father. What would'st thou haue Laertes? Dread my Lord, Your leaue and fauour to returne to France, From whence, though willingly I came to Denmarke To shew my duty in your Coronation, Yet now I must confesse, that duty done, My thoughts and wishes bend againe towards France, And bow them to your gracious leaue and pardon Haue you your Fathers leaue? What sayes Pollonius? He hath my Lord: I do beseech you giue him leaue to go Take thy faire houre Laertes, time be thine, And thy best graces spend it at thy will: But now my Cosin Hamlet, and my Sonne? A little more then kin, and lesse then kinde How is it that the Clouds still hang on you? Not so my Lord, I am too much i'th' Sun Good Hamlet cast thy nightly colour off, And let thine eye looke like a Friend on Denmarke. Do not for euer with thy veyled lids Seeke for thy Noble Father in the dust; Thou know'st 'tis common, all that liues must dye, Passing through Nature, to Eternity I Madam, it is common If it be; Why seemes it so particular with thee Seemes Madam? Nay, it is: I know not Seemes: 'Tis not alone my Inky Cloake (good Mother) Nor Customary suites of solemne Blacke, Nor windy suspiration of forc'd breath, No, nor the fruitfull Riuer in the Eye, Nor the deiected hauiour of the Visage, Together with all Formes, Moods, shewes of Griefe, That can denote me truly. These indeed Seeme, For they are actions that a man might play: But I haue that Within, which passeth show; These, but the Trappings, and the Suites of woe 'Tis sweet and commendable In your Nature Hamlet, To giue these mourning duties to your Father: But you must know, your Father lost a Father, That Father lost, lost his, and the Suruiuer bound In filiall Obligation, for some terme To do obsequious Sorrow. But to perseuer In obstinate Condolement, is a course Of impious stubbornnesse. 'Tis vnmanly greefe, It shewes a will most incorrect to Heauen, A Heart vnfortified, a Minde impatient, An Vnderstanding simple, and vnschool'd: For, what we know must be, and is as common As any the most vulgar thing to sence, Why should we in our peeuish Opposition Take it to heart? Fye, 'tis a fault to Heauen, A fault against the Dead, a fault to Nature, To Reason most absurd, whose common Theame Is death of Fathers, and who still hath cried, From the first Coarse, till he that dyed to day, This must be so. We pray you throw to earth This vnpreuayling woe, and thinke of vs As of a Father; For let the world take note, You are the most immediate to our Throne, And with no lesse Nobility of Loue, Then that which deerest Father beares his Sonne, Do I impart towards you. For your intent In going backe to Schoole in Wittenberg, It is most retrograde to our desire: And we beseech you, bend you to remaine Heere in the cheere and comfort of our eye, Our cheefest Courtier Cosin, and our Sonne Let not thy Mother lose her Prayers Hamlet: I prythee stay with vs, go not to Wittenberg I shall in all my best Obey you Madam Why 'tis a louing, and a faire Reply, Be as our selfe in Denmarke. Madam come, This gentle and vnforc'd accord of Hamlet Sits smiling to my heart; in grace whereof, No iocond health that Denmarke drinkes to day, But the great Cannon to the Clowds shall tell, And the Kings Rouce, the Heauens shall bruite againe, Respeaking earthly Thunder. Come away. Manet Hamlet. Oh that this too too solid Flesh, would melt, Thaw, and resolue it selfe into a Dew: Or that the Euerlasting had not fixt His Cannon 'gainst Selfe-slaughter. O God, O God! How weary, stale, flat, and vnprofitable Seemes to me all the vses of this world? Fie on't? Oh fie, fie, 'tis an vnweeded Garden That growes to Seed: Things rank, and grosse in Nature Possesse it meerely. That it should come to this: But two months dead: Nay, not so much; not two, So excellent a King, that was to this Hiperion to a Satyre: so louing to my Mother, That he might not beteene the windes of heauen Visit her face too roughly. Heauen and Earth Must I remember: why she would hang on him, As if encrease of Appetite had growne By what is fed on; and yet within a month? Let me not thinke on't: Frailty, thy name is woman. A little Month, or ere those shooes were old, With which she followed my poore Fathers body Like Niobe, all teares. Why she, euen she. (O Heauen! A beast that wants discourse of Reason Would haue mourn'd longer) married with mine Vnkle, My Fathers Brother: but no more like my Father, Then I to Hercules. Within a Moneth? Ere yet the salt of most vnrighteous Teares Had left the flushing of her gauled eyes, She married. O most wicked speed, to post With such dexterity to Incestuous sheets: It is not, nor it cannot come to good. But breake my heart, for I must hold my tongue. Haile to your Lordship I am glad to see you well: Horatio, or I do forget my selfe The same my Lord, And your poore Seruant euer Sir my good friend, Ile change that name with you: And what make you from Wittenberg Horatio? Marcellus My good Lord I am very glad to see you: good euen Sir. But what in faith make you from Wittemberge? A truant disposition, good my Lord I would not haue your Enemy say so; Nor shall you doe mine eare that violence, To make it truster of your owne report Against your selfe. I know you are no Truant: But what is your affaire in Elsenour? Wee'l teach you to drinke deepe, ere you depart My Lord, I came to see your Fathers Funerall I pray thee doe not mock me (fellow Student) I thinke it was to see my Mothers Wedding Indeed my Lord, it followed hard vpon Thrift thrift Horatio: the Funerall Bakt-meats Did coldly furnish forth the Marriage Tables; Would I had met my dearest foe in heauen, Ere I had euer seene that day Horatio. My father, me thinkes I see my father Oh where my Lord? In my minds eye (Horatio) I saw him once; he was a goodly King He was a man, take him for all in all: I shall not look vpon his like againe My Lord, I thinke I saw him yesternight Saw? Who? My Lord, the King your Father The King my Father? Season your admiration for a while With an attent eare; till I may deliuer Vpon the witnesse of these Gentlemen, This maruell to you For Heauens loue let me heare Two nights together, had these Gentlemen (Marcellus and Barnardo) on their Watch In the dead wast and middle of the night Beene thus encountred. A figure like your Father, Arm'd at all points exactly, Cap a Pe, Appeares before them, and with sollemne march Goes slow and stately: By them thrice he walkt, By their opprest and feare-surprized eyes, Almost to Ielly with the Act of feare, Stand dumbe and speake not to him. This to me In dreadfull secrecie impart they did, And I with them the third Night kept the Watch, Whereas they had deliuer'd both in time, Forme of the thing; each word made true and good, The Apparition comes. I knew your Father: These hands are not more like But where was this? My Lord vpon the platforme where we watcht Did you not speake to it? My Lord, I did; But answere made it none: yet once me thought It lifted vp it head, and did addresse It selfe to motion, like as it would speake: But euen then, the Morning Cocke crew lowd; And at the sound it shrunke in hast away, And vanisht from our sight Tis very strange As I doe liue my honourd Lord 'tis true; And we did thinke it writ downe in our duty To let you know of it Indeed, indeed Sirs; but this troubles me. Hold you the watch to Night? We doe my Lord Arm'd, say you? Arm'd, my Lord From top to toe? My Lord, from head to foote Then saw you not his face? O yes, my Lord, he wore his Beauer vp What, lookt he frowningly? A countenance more in sorrow then in anger Pale, or red? Nay very pale And fixt his eyes vpon you? Most constantly I would I had beene there It would haue much amaz'd you Very like, very like: staid it long? While one with moderate hast might tell a hundred Longer, longer Not when I saw't His Beard was grisly? no It was, as I haue seene it in his life, A Sable Siluer'd Ile watch to Night; perchance 'twill wake againe I warrant you it will If it assume my noble Fathers person, Ile speake to it, though Hell it selfe should gape And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all, If you haue hitherto conceald this sight; Let it bee treble in your silence still: And whatsoeuer els shall hap to night, Giue it an vnderstanding but no tongue; I will requite your loues; so fare ye well: Vpon the Platforme twixt eleuen and twelue, Ile visit you Our duty to your Honour. Your loue, as mine to you: farewell. My Fathers Spirit in Armes? All is not well: I doubt some foule play: would the Night were come; Till then sit still my soule; foule deeds will rise, Though all the earth orewhelm them to mens eies. Scena Tertia My necessaries are imbark't; Farewell: And Sister, as the Winds giue Benefit, And Conuoy is assistant; doe not sleepe, But let me heare from you Doe you doubt that? For Hamlet, and the trifling of his fauours, Hold it a fashion and a toy in Bloude; A Violet in the youth of Primy Nature; Froward, not permanent; sweet not lasting The suppliance of a minute? No more No more but so Thinke it no more: For nature cressant does not grow alone, In thewes and Bulke: but as his Temple waxes, The inward seruice of the Minde and Soule Growes wide withall. Perhaps he loues you now, And now no soyle nor cautell doth besmerch The vertue of his feare: but you must feare His greatnesse weigh'd, his will is not his owne; For hee himselfe is subiect to his Birth: Hee may not, as vnuallued persons doe, Carue for himselfe; for, on his choyce depends The sanctity and health of the whole State. And therefore must his choyce be circumscrib'd Vnto the voyce and yeelding of that Body, Whereof he is the Head. Then if he sayes he loues you, It fits your wisedome so farre to beleeue it; As he in his peculiar Sect and force May giue his saying deed: which is no further, Then the maine voyce of Denmarke goes withall. Then weight what losse your Honour may sustaine, If with too credent eare you list his Songs; Or lose your Heart; or your chast Treasure open To his vnmastred importunity. Feare it Ophelia, feare it my deare Sister, And keepe within the reare of your Affection; Out of the shot and danger of Desire. The chariest Maid is Prodigall enough, If she vnmaske her beauty to the Moone: Vertue it selfe scapes not calumnious stroakes, The Canker Galls, the Infants of the Spring Too oft before the buttons be disclos'd, And in the Morne and liquid dew of Youth, Contagious blastments are most imminent. Be wary then, best safety lies in feare; Youth to it selfe rebels, though none else neere I shall th' effect of this good Lesson keepe, As watchmen to my heart: but good my Brother Doe not as some vngracious Pastors doe, Shew me the steepe and thorny way to Heauen; Whilst like a puft and recklesse Libertine Himselfe, the Primrose path of dalliance treads, And reaks not his owne reade Oh, feare me not. I stay too long; but here my Father comes: A double blessing is a double grace; Occasion smiles vpon a second leaue Yet heere Laertes? Aboord, aboord for shame, The winde sits in the shoulder of your saile, And you are staid for there: my blessing with you; And these few Precepts in thy memory, See thou Character. Giue thy thoughts no tongue, Nor any vnproportion'd thoughts his Act: Be thou familiar; but by no meanes vulgar: The friends thou hast, and their adoption tride, Grapple them to thy Soule, with hoopes of Steele: But doe not dull thy palme, with entertainment Of each vnhatch't, vnfledg'd Comrade. Beware Of entrance to a quarrell: but being in Bear't that th' opposed may beware of thee. Giue euery man thine eare; but few thy voyce: Take each mans censure; but reserue thy iudgement: Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy; But not exprest in fancie; rich, not gawdie: For the Apparell oft proclaimes the man. And they in France of the best ranck and station, Are of a most select and generous cheff in that. Neither a borrower, nor a lender be; For lone oft loses both it selfe and friend: And borrowing duls the edge of Husbandry. This aboue all; to thine owne selfe be true: And it must follow, as the Night the Day, Thou canst not then be false to any man. Farewell: my Blessing season this in thee Most humbly doe I take my leaue, my Lord The time inuites you, goe, your seruants tend Farewell Ophelia, and remember well What I haue said to you Tis in my memory lockt, And you your selfe shall keepe the key of it Farewell. What ist Ophelia he hath said to you? So please you, somthing touching the L. Hamlet Marry, well bethought: Tis told me he hath very oft of late Giuen priuate time to you; and you your selfe Haue of your audience beene most free and bounteous. If it be so, as so tis put on me; And that in way of caution: I must tell you, You doe not vnderstand your selfe so cleerely, As it behoues my Daughter, and your Honour. What is betweene you, giue me vp the truth? He hath my Lord of late, made many tenders Of his affection to me Affection, puh. You speake like a greene Girle, Vnsifted in such perillous Circumstance. Doe you beleeue his tenders, as you call them? I do not know, my Lord, what I should thinke Marry Ile teach you; thinke your selfe a Baby, That you haue tane his tenders for true pay, Which are not starling. Tender your selfe more dearly; Or not to crack the winde of the poore Phrase, Roaming it thus, you'l tender me a foole My Lord, he hath importun'd me with loue, In honourable fashion I, fashion you may call it, go too, go too And hath giuen countenance to his speech, My Lord, with all the vowes of Heauen I, Springes to catch Woodcocks. I doe know When the Bloud burnes, how Prodigall the Soule Giues the tongue vowes: these blazes, Daughter, Giuing more light then heate; extinct in both, Euen in their promise, as it is a making; You must not take for fire. For this time Daughter, Be somewhat scanter of your Maiden presence; Set your entreatments at a higher rate, Then a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet, Beleeue so much in him, that he is young, And with a larger tether may he walke, Then may be giuen you. In few, Ophelia, Doe not beleeue his vowes; for they are Broakers, Not of the eye, which their Inuestments show: But meere implorators of vnholy Sutes, Breathing like sanctified and pious bonds, The better to beguile. This is for all: I would not, in plaine tearmes, from this time forth, Haue you so slander any moment leisure, As to giue words or talke with the Lord Hamlet: Looke too't, I charge you; come your wayes I shall obey my Lord. The Ayre bites shrewdly: is it very cold? It is a nipping and an eager ayre What hower now? I thinke it lacks of twelue No, it is strooke Indeed I heard it not: then it drawes neere the season, Wherein the Spirit held his wont to walke. What does this meane my Lord? The King doth wake to night, and takes his rouse, Keepes wassels and the swaggering vpspring reeles, And as he dreines his draughts of Renish downe, The kettle Drum and Trumpet thus bray out The triumph of his Pledge Is it a custome? I marry ist; And to my mind, though I am natiue heere, And to the manner borne: It is a Custome More honour'd in the breach, then the obseruance. Looke my Lord, it comes Angels and Ministers of Grace defend vs: Be thou a Spirit of health, or Goblin damn'd, Bring with thee ayres from Heauen, or blasts from Hell, Be thy euents wicked or charitable, Thou com'st in such a questionable shape That I will speake to thee. Ile call thee Hamlet, King, Father, Royall Dane: Oh, oh, answer me, Let me not burst in Ignorance; but tell Why thy Canoniz'd bones Hearsed in death, Haue burst their cerments, why the Sepulcher Wherein we saw thee quietly enurn'd, Hath op'd his ponderous and Marble iawes, To cast thee vp againe? What may this meane? That thou dead Coarse againe in compleat steele, Reuisits thus the glimpses of the Moone, Making Night hidious? And we fooles of Nature, So horridly to shake our disposition, With thoughts beyond thee; reaches of our Soules, Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we doe? Ghost beckens Hamlet. It beckons you to goe away with it, As if it some impartment did desire To you alone Looke with what courteous action It wafts you to a more remoued ground: But doe not goe with it No, by no meanes It will not speake: then will I follow it Doe not my Lord Why, what should be the feare? I doe not set my life at a pins fee; And for my Soule, what can it doe to that? Being a thing immortall as it selfe: It waues me forth againe; Ile follow it What if it tempt you toward the Floud my Lord? Or to the dreadfull Sonnet of the Cliffe, That beetles o're his base into the Sea, And there assumes some other horrible forme, Which might depriue your Soueraignty of Reason, And draw you into madnesse thinke of it? It wafts me still: goe on, Ile follow thee You shall not goe my Lord Hold off your hand Be rul'd, you shall not goe My fate cries out, And makes each petty Artire in this body, As hardy as the Nemian Lions nerue: Still am I cal'd? Vnhand me Gentlemen: By Heau'n, Ile make a Ghost of him that lets me: I say away, goe on, Ile follow thee. He waxes desperate with imagination Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him Haue after, to what issue will this come? Something is rotten in the State of Denmarke Heauen will direct it Nay, let's follow him. Where wilt thou lead me? speak; Ile go no further Marke me I will My hower is almost come, When I to sulphurous and tormenting Flames Must render vp my selfe Alas poore Ghost Pitty me not, but lend thy serious hearing To what I shall vnfold Speake, I am bound to heare So art thou to reuenge, when thou shalt heare What? I am thy Fathers Spirit, Doom'd for a certaine terme to walke the night; And for the day confin'd to fast in Fiers, Till the foule crimes done in my dayes of Nature Are burnt and purg'd away? But that I am forbid To tell the secrets of my Prison-House; I could a Tale vnfold, whose lightest word Would harrow vp thy soule, freeze thy young blood, Make thy two eyes like Starres, start from their Spheres, Thy knotty and combined lockes to part, And each particular haire to stand an end, Like Quilles vpon the fretfull Porpentine: But this eternall blason must not be To eares of flesh and bloud; list Hamlet, oh list, If thou didst euer thy deare Father loue Oh Heauen! Reuenge his foule and most vnnaturall Murther Murther? Murther most foule, as in the best it is; But this most foule, strange, and vnnaturall Hast, hast me to know it, That with wings as swift As meditation, or the thoughts of Loue, May sweepe to my Reuenge I finde thee apt, And duller should'st thou be then the fat weede That rots it selfe in ease, on Lethe Wharfe, Would'st thou not stirre in this. Now Hamlet heare: It's giuen out, that sleeping in mine Orchard, A Serpent stung me: so the whole eare of Denmarke, Is by a forged processe of my death Rankly abus'd: But know thou Noble youth, The Serpent that did sting thy Fathers life, Now weares his Crowne O my Propheticke soule: mine Vncle? I that incestuous, that adulterate Beast With witchcraft of his wits, hath Traitorous guifts. Oh wicked Wit, and Gifts, that haue the power So to seduce? Won to this shamefull Lust The will of my most seeming vertuous Queene: Oh Hamlet, what a falling off was there, From me, whose loue was of that dignity, That it went hand in hand, euen with the Vow I made to her in Marriage; and to decline Vpon a wretch, whose Naturall gifts were poore To those of mine. But Vertue, as it neuer wil be moued, Though Lewdnesse court it in a shape of Heauen: So Lust, though to a radiant Angell link'd, Will sate it selfe in a Celestiall bed, & prey on Garbage. But soft, me thinkes I sent the Mornings Ayre; Briefe let me be: Sleeping within mine Orchard, My custome alwayes in the afternoone; Vpon my secure hower thy Vncle stole With iuyce of cursed Hebenon in a Violl, And in the Porches of mine eares did poure The leaperous Distilment; whose effect Holds such an enmity with bloud of Man, That swift as Quick-siluer, it courses through The naturall Gates and Allies of the body; And with a sodaine vigour it doth posset And curd, like Aygre droppings into Milke, The thin and wholsome blood: so did it mine; And a most instant Tetter bak'd about, Most Lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust, All my smooth Body. Thus was I, sleeping, by a Brothers hand, Of Life, of Crowne, and Queene at once dispatcht; Cut off euen in the Blossomes of my Sinne, Vnhouzzled, disappointed, vnnaneld, No reckoning made, but sent to my account With all my imperfections on my head; Oh horrible Oh horrible, most horrible: If thou hast nature in thee beare it not; Let not the Royall Bed of Denmarke be A Couch for Luxury and damned Incest. But howsoeuer thou pursuest this Act, Taint not thy mind; nor let thy Soule contriue Against thy Mother ought; leaue her to heauen, And to those Thornes that in her bosome lodge, To pricke and sting her. Fare thee well at once; The Glow-worme showes the Matine to be neere, And gins to pale his vneffectuall Fire: Adue, adue, Hamlet: remember me. Oh all you host of Heauen! Oh Earth; what els? And shall I couple Hell? Oh fie: hold my heart; And you my sinnewes, grow not instant Old; But beare me stiffely vp: Remember thee? I, thou poore Ghost, while memory holds a seate In this distracted Globe: Remember thee? Yea, from the Table of my Memory, Ile wipe away all triuiall fond Records, All sawes of Bookes, all formes, all presures past, That youth and obseruation coppied there; And thy Commandment all alone shall liue Vnmixt with baser matter; yes yes, by Heauen: Oh most pernicious woman! Oh Villaine, Villaine, smiling damned Villaine! My Tables, my Tables; meet it is I set it downe, That one may smile, and smile and be a Villaine; At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmarke; So Vnckle there you are: now to my word; It is; Adue, Adue, Remember me: I haue sworn't & Mar. within. My Lord, my Lord. Lord Hamlet Heauen secure him So be it Illo, ho, ho, my Lord Hillo, ho, ho, boy; come bird, come How ist my Noble Lord? What newes, my Lord? Oh wonderfull! Good my Lord tell it No you'l reueale it Not I, my Lord, by Heauen Nor I, my Lord How say you then, would heart of man once think it? But you'l be secret? I, by Heau'n, my Lord There's nere a villaine dwelling in all Denmarke But hee's an arrant knaue There needs no Ghost my Lord, come from the Graue, to tell vs this Why right, you are i'th' right; And so, without more circumstance at all, I hold it fit that we shake hands, and part: You, as your busines and desires shall point you: For euery man ha's businesse and desire, Such as it is: and for mine owne poore part, Looke you, Ile goe pray These are but wild and hurling words, my Lord I'm sorry they offend you heartily: Yes faith, heartily There's no offence my Lord Yes, by Saint Patricke, but there is my Lord, And much offence too, touching this Vision heere: It is an honest Ghost, that let me tell you: For your desire to know what is betweene vs, O'remaster't as you may. And now good friends, As you are Friends, Schollers and Soldiers, Giue me one poore request What is't my Lord? we will Neuer make known what you haue seen to night My Lord, we will not Nay, but swear't Infaith my Lord, not I Nor I my Lord: in faith Vpon my sword We haue sworne my Lord already Indeed, vpon my sword, Indeed Sweare. Ghost cries vnder the Stage. Ah ha boy, sayest thou so. Art thou there truepenny? Come one you here this fellow in the selleredge Consent to sweare Propose the Oath my Lord Neuer to speake of this that you haue seene. Sweare by my sword Sweare Hic & vbique? Then wee'l shift for grownd, Come hither Gentlemen, And lay your hands againe vpon my sword, Neuer to speake of this that you haue heard: Sweare by my Sword Sweare Well said old Mole, can'st worke i'th' ground so fast? A worthy Pioner, once more remoue good friends Oh day and night: but this is wondrous strange And therefore as a stranger giue it welcome. There are more things in Heauen and Earth, Horatio, Then are dream't of in our Philosophy. But come, Here as before, neuer so helpe you mercy, How strange or odde so ere I beare my selfe; (As I perchance heereafter shall thinke meet To put an Anticke disposition on:) That you at such time seeing me, neuer shall With Armes encombred thus, or thus, head shake; Or by pronouncing of some doubtfull Phrase; As well, we know, or we could and if we would, Or if we list to speake; or there be and if there might, Or such ambiguous giuing out to note, That you know ought of me; this not to doe: So grace and mercy at your most neede helpe you: Sweare Sweare Rest, rest perturbed Spirit: so Gentlemen, With all my loue I doe commend me to you; And what so poore a man as Hamlet is, May doe t' expresse his loue and friending to you, God willing shall not lacke: let vs goe in together, And still your fingers on your lippes I pray, The time is out of ioynt: Oh cursed spight, That euer I was borne to set it right. Nay, come let's goe together. Giue him his money, and these notes Reynoldo I will my Lord You shall doe maruels wisely: good Reynoldo, Before you visite him you make inquiry Of his behauiour My Lord, I did intend it Marry, well said; Very well said. Looke you Sir, Enquire me first what Danskers are in Paris; And how, and who; what meanes; and where they keepe: What company, at what expence: and finding By this encompassement and drift of question, That they doe know my sonne: Come you more neerer Then your particular demands will touch it, Take you as 'twere some distant knowledge of him, And thus I know his father and his friends, And in part him. Doe you marke this Reynoldo? I, very well my Lord And in part him, but you may say not well; But if't be hee I meane, hees very wilde; Addicted so and so; and there put on him What forgeries you please; marry, none so ranke, As may dishonour him; take heed of that: But Sir, such wanton, wild, and vsuall slips, As are Companions noted and most knowne To youth and liberty As gaming my Lord I, or drinking, fencing, swearing, Quarelling, drabbing. You may goe so farre My Lord that would dishonour him Faith no, as you may season it in the charge; You must not put another scandall on him, That hee is open to Incontinencie; That's not my meaning: but breath his faults so quaintly, That they may seeme the taints of liberty; The flash and out-breake of a fiery minde, A sauagenes in vnreclaim'd bloud of generall assault But my good Lord Wherefore should you doe this? I my Lord, I would know that Marry Sir, heere's my drift, And I belieue it is a fetch of warrant: You laying these slight sulleyes on my Sonne, As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i'th' working: Marke you your party in conuerse; him you would sound, Hauing euer seene. In the prenominate crimes, The youth you breath of guilty, be assur'd He closes with you in this consequence: Good sir, or so, or friend, or Gentleman. According to the Phrase and the Addition, Of man and Country Very good my Lord And then Sir does he this? He does: what was I about to say? I was about say somthing: where did I leaue? At closes in the consequence: At friend, or so, and Gentleman At closes in the consequence, I marry, He closes with you thus. I know the Gentleman, I saw him yesterday, or tother day; Or then or then, with such and such; and as you say, There was he gaming, there o'retooke in's Rouse, There falling out at Tennis; or perchance, I saw him enter such a house of saile; Videlicet, a Brothell, or so forth. See you now; Your bait of falshood, takes this Cape of truth; And thus doe we of wisedome and of reach With windlesses, and with assaies of Bias, By indirections finde directions out: So by my former Lecture and aduice Shall you my Sonne; you haue me, haue you not? My Lord I haue God buy you; fare you well Good my Lord Obserue his inclination in your selfe I shall my Lord And let him plye his Musicke Well, my Lord. Farewell: How now Ophelia, what's the matter? Alas my Lord, I haue beene so affrighted With what, in the name of Heauen? My Lord, as I was sowing in my Chamber, Lord Hamlet with his doublet all vnbrac'd, No hat vpon his head, his stockings foul'd, Vngartred, and downe giued to his Anckle, Pale as his shirt, his knees knocking each other, And with a looke so pitious in purport, As if he had been loosed out of hell, To speake of horrors: he comes before me Mad for thy Loue? My Lord, I doe not know: but truly I do feare it What said he? He tooke me by the wrist, and held me hard; Then goes he to the length of all his arme; And with his other hand thus o're his brow, He fals to such perusall of my face, As he would draw it. Long staid he so, At last, a little shaking of mine Arme: And thrice his head thus wauing vp and downe; He rais'd a sigh, so pittious and profound, That it did seeme to shatter all his bulke, And end his being. That done, he lets me goe, And with his head ouer his shoulders turn'd, He seem'd to finde his way without his eyes, For out adores he went without their helpe; And to the last, bended their light on me Goe with me, I will goe seeke the King, This is the very extasie of Loue, Whose violent property foredoes it selfe, And leads the will to desperate Vndertakings, As oft as any passion vnder Heauen, That does afflict our Natures. I am sorrie, What haue you giuen him any hard words of late? No my good Lord: but as you did command, I did repell his Letters, and deny'de His accesse to me That hath made him mad. I am sorrie that with better speed and iudgement I had not quoted him. I feare he did but trifle, And meant to wracke thee: but beshrew my iealousie: It seemes it is as proper to our Age, To cast beyond our selues in our Opinions, As it is common for the yonger sort To lacke discretion. Come, go we to the King, This must be knowne, being kept close might moue More greefe to hide, then hate to vtter loue. Scena Secunda. Welcome deere Rosincrance and Guildensterne. Moreouer, that we much did long to see you, The neede we haue to vse you, did prouoke Our hastie sending. Something haue you heard Of Hamlets transformation: so I call it, Since not th' exterior, nor the inward man Resembles that it was. What it should bee More then his Fathers death, that thus hath put him So much from th' vnderstanding of himselfe, I cannot deeme of. I intreat you both, That being of so young dayes brought vp with him: And since so Neighbour'd to his youth, and humour, That you vouchsafe your rest heere in our Court Some little time: so by your Companies To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather So much as from Occasions you may gleane, That open'd lies within our remedie Good Gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you, And sure I am, two men there are not liuing, To whom he more adheres. If it will please you To shew vs so much Gentrie, and good will, As to expend your time with vs a-while, For the supply and profit of our Hope, Your Visitation shall receiue such thankes As fits a Kings remembrance Both your Maiesties Might by the Soueraigne power you haue of vs, Put your dread pleasures, more into Command Then to Entreatie We both obey, And here giue vp our selues, in the full bent, To lay our Seruices freely at your feete, To be commanded Thankes Rosincrance, and gentle Guildensterne Thankes Guildensterne and gentle Rosincrance. And I beseech you instantly to visit My too much changed Sonne. Go some of ye, And bring the Gentlemen where Hamlet is Heauens make our presence and our practises Pleasant and helpfull to him. Amen. Th' Ambassadors from Norwey, my good Lord, Are ioyfully return'd Thou still hast bin the father of good Newes Haue I, my Lord? Assure you, my good Liege, I hold my dutie, as I hold my Soule, Both to my God, one to my gracious King: And I do thinke, or else this braine of mine Hunts not the traile of Policie, so sure As I haue vs'd to do: that I haue found The very cause of Hamlets Lunacie Oh speake of that, that I do long to heare Giue first admittance to th' Ambassadors, My Newes shall be the Newes to that great Feast Thy selfe do grace to them, and bring them in. He tels me my sweet Queene, that he hath found The head and sourse of all your Sonnes distemper I doubt it is no other, but the maine, His Fathers death, and our o're-hasty Marriage. Well, we shall sift him. Welcome good Frends: Say Voltumand, what from our Brother Norwey? Most faire returne of Greetings, and Desires. Vpon our first, he sent out to suppresse His Nephewes Leuies, which to him appear'd To be a preparation 'gainst the Poleak: But better look'd into, he truly found It was against your Highnesse, whereat greeued, That so his Sicknesse, Age, and Impotence Was falsely borne in hand, sends out Arrests On Fortinbras, which he (in breefe) obeyes, Receiues rebuke from Norwey: and in fine, Makes Vow before his Vnkle, neuer more To giue th' assay of Armes against your Maiestie. Whereon old Norwey, ouercome with ioy, Giues him three thousand Crownes in Annuall Fee, And his Commission to imploy those Soldiers So leuied as before, against the Poleak: With an intreaty heerein further shewne, That it might please you to giue quiet passe Through your Dominions, for his Enterprize, On such regards of safety and allowance, As therein are set downe It likes vs well: And at our more consider'd time wee'l read, Answer, and thinke vpon this Businesse. Meane time we thanke you, for your well-tooke Labour. Go to your rest, at night wee'l Feast together. Most welcome home. This businesse is very well ended. My Liege, and Madam, to expostulate What Maiestie should be, what Dutie is, Why day is day; night, night; and time is time, Were nothing but to waste Night, Day, and Time. Therefore, since Breuitie is the Soule of Wit, And tediousnesse, the limbes and outward flourishes, I will be breefe. Your Noble Sonne is mad: Mad call I it; for to define true Madnesse, What is't, but to be nothing else but mad. But let that go More matter, with lesse Art Madam, I sweare I vse no Art at all: That he is mad, 'tis true: 'Tis true 'tis pittie, And pittie it is true: A foolish figure, But farewell it: for I will vse no Art. Mad let vs grant him then: and now remaines That we finde out the cause of this effect, Or rather say, the cause of this defect; For this effect defectiue, comes by cause, Thus it remaines, and the remainder thus. Perpend, I haue a daughter: haue, whil'st she is mine, Who in her Dutie and Obedience, marke, Hath giuen me this: now gather, and surmise. The Letter. To the Celestiall, and my Soules Idoll, the most beautifed Ophelia. That's an ill Phrase, a vilde Phrase, beautified is a vilde Phrase: but you shall heare these in her excellent white bosome, these Came this from Hamlet to her Good Madam stay awhile, I will be faithfull. Doubt thou, the Starres are fire, Doubt, that the Sunne doth moue: Doubt Truth to be a Lier, But neuer Doubt, I loue. O deere Ophelia, I am ill at these Numbers: I haue not Art to reckon my grones; but that I loue thee best, oh most Best beleeue it. Adieu. Thine euermore most deere Lady, whilst this Machine is to him, Hamlet. This in Obedience hath my daughter shew'd me: And more aboue hath his soliciting, As they fell out by Time, by Meanes, and Place, All giuen to mine eare But how hath she receiu'd his Loue? What do you thinke of me? As of a man, faithfull and Honourable I wold faine proue so. But what might you think? When I had seene this hot loue on the wing, As I perceiued it, I must tell you that Before my Daughter told me what might you Or my deere Maiestie your Queene heere, think, If I had playd the Deske or Table-booke, Or giuen my heart a winking, mute and dumbe, Or look'd vpon this Loue, with idle sight, What might you thinke? No, I went round to worke, And (my yong Mistris) thus I did bespeake Lord Hamlet is a Prince out of thy Starre, This must not be: and then, I Precepts gaue her, That she should locke her selfe from his Resort, Admit no Messengers, receiue no Tokens: Which done, she tooke the Fruites of my Aduice, And he repulsed. A short Tale to make, Fell into a Sadnesse, then into a Fast, Thence to a Watch, thence into a Weaknesse, Thence to a Lightnesse, and by this declension Into the Madnesse whereon now he raues, And all we waile for Do you thinke 'tis this? It may be very likely Hath there bene such a time, I'de fain know that, That I haue possitiuely said, 'tis so, When it prou'd otherwise? Not that I know Take this from this; if this be otherwise, If Circumstances leade me, I will finde Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeede How may we try it further? You know sometimes He walkes foure houres together, heere In the Lobby So he ha's indeed At such a time Ile loose my Daughter to him, Be you and I behinde an Arras then, Marke the encounter: If he loue her not, And be not from his reason falne thereon; Let me be no Assistant for a State, And keepe a Farme and Carters We will try it. But looke where sadly the poore wretch Comes reading Away I do beseech you, both away, Ile boord him presently. Oh giue me leaue. How does my good Lord Hamlet? Well, God-a-mercy Do you know me, my Lord? Excellent, excellent well: y'are a Fishmonger Not I my Lord Then I would you were so honest a man Honest, my Lord? I sir, to be honest as this world goes, is to bee one man pick'd out of two thousand That's very true, my Lord For if the Sun breed Magots in a dead dogge, being a good kissing Carrion- Haue you a daughter? I haue my Lord Let her not walke i'thSunne: Conception is a blessing, but not as your daughter may conceiue. Friend looke too't How say you by that? Still harping on my daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I was a Fishmonger: he is farre gone, farre gone: and truly in my youth, I suffred much extreamity for loue: very neere this. Ile speake to him againe. What do you read my Lord? Words, words, words What is the matter, my Lord? Betweene who? I meane the matter you meane, my Lord Slanders Sir: for the Satyricall slaue saies here, that old men haue gray Beards; that their faces are wrinkled; their eyes purging thicke Amber, or Plum-Tree Gumme: and that they haue a plentifull locke of Wit, together with weake Hammes. All which Sir, though I most powerfully, and potently beleeue; yet I holde it not Honestie to haue it thus set downe: For you your selfe Sir, should be old as I am, if like a Crab you could go backward Though this be madnesse, Yet there is Method in't: will you walke Out of the ayre my Lord? Into my Graue? Indeed that is out o'th' Ayre: How pregnant (sometimes) his Replies are? A happinesse, That often Madnesse hits on, Which Reason and Sanitie could not So prosperously be deliuer'd of. I will leaue him, And sodainely contriue the meanes of meeting Betweene him, and my daughter. My Honourable Lord, I will most humbly Take my leaue of you You cannot Sir take from me any thing, that I will more willingly part withall, except my life, my life Fare you well my Lord These tedious old fooles You goe to seeke my Lord Hamlet; there hee is. God saue you Sir Mine honour'd Lord? My most deare Lord? My excellent good friends? How do'st thou Guildensterne? Oh, Rosincrane; good Lads: How doe ye both? As the indifferent Children of the earth Happy, in that we are not ouer-happy: on Fortunes Cap, we are not the very Button Nor the Soales of her Shoo? Neither my Lord Then you liue about her waste, or in the middle of her fauour? Faith, her priuates, we In the secret parts of Fortune? Oh, most true: she is a Strumpet. What's the newes? None my Lord; but that the World's growne honest Then is Doomesday neere: But your newes is not true. Let me question more in particular: what haue you my good friends, deserued at the hands of Fortune, that she sends you to Prison hither? Prison, my Lord? Denmark's a Prison Then is the World one A goodly one, in which there are many Confines, Wards, and Dungeons; Denmarke being one o'th' worst We thinke not so my Lord Why then 'tis none to you; for there is nothing either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me it is a prison Why then your Ambition makes it one: 'tis too narrow for your minde O God, I could be bounded in a nutshell, and count my selfe a King of infinite space; were it not that I haue bad dreames Which dreames indeed are Ambition: for the very substance of the Ambitious, is meerely the shadow of a Dreame A dreame it selfe is but a shadow Truely, and I hold Ambition of so ayry and light a quality, that it is but a shadowes shadow Then are our Beggers bodies; and our Monarchs and out-stretcht Heroes the Beggers Shadowes: shall wee to th' Court: for, by my fey I cannot reason? Wee'l wait vpon you No such matter. I will not sort you with the rest of my seruants: for to speake to you like an honest man: I am most dreadfully attended; but in the beaten way of friendship, What make you at Elsonower? To visit you my Lord, no other occasion Begger that I am, I am euen poore in thankes; but I thanke you: and sure deare friends my thanks are too deare a halfepeny; were you not sent for? Is it your owne inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come, deale iustly with me: come, come; nay speake What should we say my Lord? Why any thing. But to the purpose; you were sent for; and there is a kinde confession in your lookes; which your modesties haue not craft enough to color, I know the good King & Queene haue sent for you To what end my Lord? That you must teach me: but let mee coniure you by the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of our youth, by the Obligation of our euer-preserued loue, and by what more deare, a better proposer could charge you withall; be euen and direct with me, whether you were sent for or no What say you? Nay then I haue an eye of you: if you loue me hold not off My Lord, we were sent for I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation preuent your discouery of your secricie to the King and Queene: moult no feather, I haue of late, but wherefore I know not, lost all my mirth, forgone all custome of exercise; and indeed, it goes so heauenly with my disposition; that this goodly frame the Earth, seemes to me a sterrill Promontory; this most excellent Canopy the Ayre, look you, this braue ore-hanging, this Maiesticall Roofe, fretted with golden fire: why, it appeares no other thing to mee, then a foule and pestilent congregation of vapours. What a piece of worke is a man! how Noble in Reason? how infinite in faculty? in forme and mouing how expresse and admirable? in Action, how like an Angel? in apprehension, how like a God? the beauty of the world, the Parragon of Animals; and yet to me, what is this Quintessence of Dust? Man delights not me; no, nor Woman neither; though by your smiling you seeme to say so My Lord, there was no such stuffe in my thoughts Why did you laugh, when I said, Man delights not me? To thinke, my Lord, if you delight not in Man, what Lenton entertainment the Players shall receiue from you: wee coated them on the way, and hither are they comming to offer you Seruice He that playes the King shall be welcome; his Maiesty shall haue Tribute of mee: the aduenturous Knight shal vse his Foyle and Target: the Louer shall not sigh gratis, the humorous man shall end his part in peace: the Clowne shall make those laugh whose lungs are tickled a'th' sere: and the Lady shall say her minde freely; or the blanke Verse shall halt for't: what Players are they? Euen those you were wont to take delight in the Tragedians of the City How chances it they trauaile? their residence both in reputation and profit was better both wayes I thinke their Inhibition comes by the meanes of the late Innouation? Doe they hold the same estimation they did when I was in the City? Are they so follow'd? No indeed, they are not How comes it? doe they grow rusty? Nay, their indeauour keepes in the wonted pace; But there is Sir an ayrie of Children, little Yases, that crye out on the top of question; and are most tyrannically clap't for't: these are now the fashion, and so be-ratled the common Stages (so they call them) that many wearing Rapiers, are affraide of Goose-quils, and dare scarse come thither What are they Children? Who maintains 'em? How are they escorted? Will they pursue the Quality no longer then they can sing? Will they not say afterwards if they should grow themselues to common Players (as it is most like if their meanes are not better) their Writers do them wrong, to make them exclaim against their owne Succession Faith there ha's bene much to do on both sides: and the Nation holds it no sinne, to tarre them to Controuersie. There was for a while, no mony bid for argument, vnlesse the Poet and the Player went to Cuffes in the Question Is't possible? Oh there ha's beene much throwing about of Braines Do the Boyes carry it away? I that they do my Lord. Hercules & his load too It is not strange: for mine Vnckle is King of Denmarke, and those that would make mowes at him while my Father liued; giue twenty, forty, an hundred Ducates a peece, for his picture in Little. There is something in this more then Naturall, if Philosophie could finde it out. There are the Players Gentlemen, you are welcom to Elsonower: your hands, come: The appurtenance of Welcome, is Fashion and Ceremony. Let me comply with you in the Garbe, lest my extent to the Players (which I tell you must shew fairely outward) should more appeare like entertainment then yours. You are welcome: but my Vnckle Father, and Aunt Mother are deceiu'd In what my deere Lord? I am but mad North, North-West: when the Winde is Southerly, I know a Hawke from a Handsaw. Well be with you Gentlemen Hearke you Guildensterne, and you too: at each eare a hearer: that great Baby you see there, is not yet out of his swathing clouts Happily he's the second time come to them: for they say, an old man is twice a childe I will Prophesie. Hee comes to tell me of the Mark it, you say right Sir: for a Monday morning 'twas so indeed My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you My Lord, I haue Newes to tell you. When Rossius an Actor in Rome- The Actors are come hither my Lord Buzze, buzze Vpon mine Honor Then can each Actor on his Asse- The best Actors in the world, either for Tragedie, Comedie, Historie, Pastorall: Pastoricall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall: Tragicall-Historicall: Tragicall-Comicall-Historicall-Pastorall: Scene indiuidible: or Poem vnlimited. Seneca cannot be too heauy, nor Plautus too light, for the law of Writ, and the Liberty. These are the onely men O Iephta Iudge of Israel, what a Treasure had'st thou? What a Treasure had he, my Lord? Why one faire Daughter, and no more, The which he loued passing well Still on my Daughter Am I not i'th' right old Iephta? If you call me Iephta my Lord, I haue a daughter that I loue passing well Nay that followes not What followes then, my Lord? Why, As by lot, God wot: and then you know, It came to passe, as most like it was: The first rowe of the Pons Chanson will shew you more. For looke where my Abridgements come. Y'are welcome Masters, welcome all. I am glad to see thee well: Welcome good Friends. Oh my olde Friend? Thy face is valiant since I saw thee last: Com'st thou to beard me in Denmarke? What, my yong Lady and Mistris? Byrlady your Ladiship is neerer Heauen then when I saw you last, by the altitude of a Choppine. Pray God your voice like a peece of vncurrant Gold be not crack'd to't like French Faulconers, flie at any thing we see: wee'l haue a Speech straight. Come giue vs a tast of your quality: come, a passionate speech 1.Play. What speech, my Lord? I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was neuer Acted: or if it was, not aboue once, for the Play I remember pleas'd not the Million, 'twas Cauiarie to the Generall: but it was (as I receiu'd it, and others, whose iudgement in such matters, cried in the top of mine) an excellent Play; well digested in the Scoenes, set downe with as much modestie, as cunning. I remember one said, there was no Sallets in the lines, to make the matter sauory; nor no matter in the phrase, that might indite the Author of affectation, but cal'd it an honest method. One cheefe Speech in it, I cheefely lou'd, 'twas Aeneas Tale to Dido, and thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of Priams slaughter. If it liue in your memory, begin at this Line, let me see, let me see: The rugged Pyrrhus like th'Hyrcanian Beast. It is not so: it begins with Pyrrhus The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose Sable Armes Blacke as his purpose, did the night resemble When he lay couched in the Ominous Horse, Hath now this dread and blacke Complexion smear'd With Heraldry more dismall: Head to foote Now is he to take Geulles, horridly Trick'd With blood of Fathers, Mothers, Daughters, Sonnes, Bak'd and impasted with the parching streets, That lend a tyrannous, and damned light To their vilde Murthers, roasted in wrath and fire, And thus o're-sized with coagulate gore, With eyes like Carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus Olde Grandsire Priam seekes Fore God, my Lord, well spoken, with good accent, and good discretion 1.Player. Anon he findes him, Striking too short at Greekes. His anticke Sword, Rebellious to his Arme, lyes where it falles Repugnant to command: vnequall match, Pyrrhus at Priam driues, in Rage strikes wide: But with the whiffe and winde of his fell Sword, Th' vnnerued Father fals. Then senselesse Illium, Seeming to feele his blow, with flaming top Stoopes to his Bace, and with a hideous crash Takes Prisoner Pyrrhus eare. For loe, his Sword Which was declining on the Milkie head Of Reuerend Priam, seem'd i'th' Ayre to sticke: So as a painted Tyrant Pyrrhus stood, And like a Newtrall to his will and matter, did nothing. But as we often see against some storme, A silence in the Heauens, the Racke stand still, The bold windes speechlesse, and the Orbe below As hush as death: Anon the dreadfull Thunder Doth rend the Region. So after Pyrrhus pause, A rowsed Vengeance sets him new a-worke, And neuer did the Cyclops hammers fall On Mars his Armours, forg'd for proofe Eterne, With lesse remorse then Pyrrhus bleeding sword Now falles on Priam. Out, out, thou Strumpet-Fortune, all you Gods, In generall Synod take away her power: Breake all the Spokes and Fallies from her wheele, And boule the round Naue downe the hill of Heauen, As low as to the Fiends This is too long It shall to'th Barbars, with your beard. Prythee say on: He's for a Iigge, or a tale of Baudry, or hee sleepes. Say on; come to Hecuba 1.Play. But who, O who, had seen the inobled Queen The inobled Queene? That's good: Inobled Queene is good 1.Play. Run bare-foot vp and downe, Threatning the flame With Bisson Rheume: A clout about that head, Where late the Diadem stood, and for a Robe About her lanke and all ore-teamed Loines, A blanket in th' Alarum of feare caught vp. Who this had seene, with tongue in Venome steep'd, 'Gainst Fortunes State, would Treason haue pronounc'd? But if the Gods themselues did see her then, When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport In mincing with his Sword her Husbands limbes, The instant Burst of Clamour that she made (Vnlesse things mortall moue them not at all) Would haue made milche the Burning eyes of Heauen, And passion in the Gods Looke where he ha's not turn'd his colour, and ha's teares in's eyes. Pray you no more 'Tis well, Ile haue thee speake out the rest, soone. Good my Lord, will you see the Players wel bestow'd. Do ye heare, let them be well vs'd: for they are the Abstracts and breefe Chronicles of the time. After your death, you were better haue a bad Epitaph, then their ill report while you liued My Lord, I will vse them according to their desart Gods bodykins man, better. Vse euerie man after his desart, and who should scape whipping: vse them after your own Honor and Dignity. The lesse they deserue, the more merit is in your bountie. Take them in Come sirs. Follow him Friends: wee'l heare a play to morrow. Dost thou heare me old Friend, can you play the murther of Gonzago? I my Lord Wee'l ha't to morrow night. You could for a need study a speech of some dosen or sixteene lines, which I would set downe, and insert in't? Could ye not? I my Lord Very well. Follow that Lord, and looke you mock him not. My good Friends, Ile leaue you til night you are welcome to Elsonower? Good my Lord. Manet Hamlet. I so, God buy'ye: Now I am alone. Oh what a Rogue and Pesant slaue am I? Is it not monstrous that this Player heere, But in a Fixion, in a dreame of Passion, Could force his soule so to his whole conceit, That from her working, all his visage warm'd; Teares in his eyes, distraction in's Aspect, A broken voyce, and his whole Function suiting With Formes, to his Conceit? And all for nothing? For Hecuba? What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba, That he should weepe for her? What would he doe, Had he the Motiue and the Cue for passion That I haue? He would drowne the Stage with teares, And cleaue the generall eare with horrid speech: Make mad the guilty, and apale the free, Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed, The very faculty of Eyes and Eares. Yet I, A dull and muddy-metled Rascall, peake Like Iohn a-dreames, vnpregnant of my cause, And can say nothing: No, not for a King, Vpon whose property, and most deere life, A damn'd defeate was made. Am I a Coward? Who calles me Villaine? breakes my pate a-crosse? Pluckes off my Beard, and blowes it in my face? Tweakes me by'th' Nose? giues me the Lye i'th' Throate, As deepe as to the Lungs? Who does me this? Ha? Why I should take it: for it cannot be, But I am Pigeon-Liuer'd, and lacke Gall To make Oppression bitter, or ere this, I should haue fatted all the Region Kites With this Slaues Offall, bloudy: a Bawdy villaine, Remorselesse, Treacherous, Letcherous, kindles villaine! Oh Vengeance! Who? What an Asse am I? I sure, this is most braue, That I, the Sonne of the Deere murthered, Prompted to my Reuenge by Heauen, and Hell, Must (like a Whore) vnpacke my heart with words, And fall a Cursing like a very Drab. A Scullion? Fye vpon't: Foh. About my Braine. I haue heard, that guilty Creatures sitting at a Play, Haue by the very cunning of the Scoene, Bene strooke so to the soule, that presently They haue proclaim'd their Malefactions. For Murther, though it haue no tongue, will speake With most myraculous Organ. Ile haue these Players, Play something like the murder of my Father, Before mine Vnkle. Ile obserue his lookes, Ile rent him to the quicke: If he but blench I know my course. The Spirit that I haue seene May be the Diuell, and the Diuel hath power T' assume a pleasing shape, yea and perhaps Out of my Weaknesse, and my Melancholly, As he is very potent with such Spirits, Abuses me to damne me. Ile haue grounds More Relatiue then this: The Play's the thing, Wherein Ile catch the Conscience of the King. Guildenstern, and And can you by no drift of circumstance Get from him why he puts on this Confusion: Grating so harshly all his dayes of quiet With turbulent and dangerous Lunacy He does confesse he feeles himselfe distracted, But from what cause he will by no meanes speake Nor do we finde him forward to be sounded, But with a crafty Madnesse keepes aloofe: When we would bring him on to some Confession Of his true state Did he receiue you well? Most like a Gentleman But with much forcing of his disposition Niggard of question, but of our demands Most free in his reply Did you assay him to any pastime? Madam, it so fell out, that certaine Players We ore-wrought on the way: of these we told him, And there did seeme in him a kinde of ioy To heare of it: They are about the Court, And (as I thinke) they haue already order This night to play before him 'Tis most true: And he beseech'd me to intreate your Maiesties To heare, and see the matter With all my heart, and it doth much content me To heare him so inclin'd. Good Gentlemen, Giue him a further edge, and driue his purpose on To these delights We shall my Lord. Sweet Gertrude leaue vs too, For we haue closely sent for Hamlet hither, That he, as 'twere by accident, may there Affront Ophelia. Her Father, and my selfe (lawful espials) Will so bestow our selues, that seeing vnseene We may of their encounter frankely iudge, And gather by him, as he is behaued, If't be th' affliction of his loue, or no. That thus he suffers for I shall obey you, And for your part Ophelia, I do wish That your good Beauties be the happy cause Of Hamlets wildenesse: so shall I hope your Vertues Will bring him to his wonted way againe, To both your Honors Madam, I wish it may Ophelia, walke you heere. Gracious so please ye We will bestow our selues: Reade on this booke, That shew of such an exercise may colour Your lonelinesse. We are oft too blame in this, 'Tis too much prou'd, that with Deuotions visage, And pious Action, we do surge o're The diuell himselfe Oh 'tis true: How smart a lash that speech doth giue my Conscience? The Harlots Cheeke beautied with plaist'ring Art Is not more vgly to the thing that helpes it, Then is my deede, to my most painted word. Oh heauie burthen! I heare him comming, let's withdraw my Lord. To be, or not to be, that is the Question: Whether 'tis Nobler in the minde to suffer The Slings and Arrowes of outragious Fortune, Or to take Armes against a Sea of troubles, And by opposing end them: to dye, to sleepe No more; and by a sleepe, to say we end The Heart-ake, and the thousand Naturall shockes That Flesh is heyre too? 'Tis a consummation Deuoutly to be wish'd. To dye to sleepe, To sleepe, perchance to Dreame; I, there's the rub, For in that sleepe of death, what dreames may come, When we haue shuffel'd off this mortall coile, Must giue vs pawse. There's the respect That makes Calamity of so long life: For who would beare the Whips and Scornes of time, The Oppressors wrong, the poore mans Contumely, The pangs of dispriz'd Loue, the Lawes delay, The insolence of Office, and the Spurnes That patient merit of the vnworthy takes, When he himselfe might his Quietus make With a bare Bodkin? Who would these Fardles beare To grunt and sweat vnder a weary life, But that the dread of something after death, The vndiscouered Countrey, from whose Borne No Traueller returnes, Puzels the will, And makes vs rather beare those illes we haue, Then flye to others that we know not of. Thus Conscience does make Cowards of vs all, And thus the Natiue hew of Resolution Is sicklied o're, with the pale cast of Thought, And enterprizes of great pith and moment, With this regard their Currants turne away, And loose the name of Action. Soft you now, The faire Ophelia? Nimph, in thy Orizons Be all my sinnes remembred Good my Lord, How does your Honor for this many a day? I humbly thanke you: well, well, well My Lord, I haue Remembrances of yours, That I haue longed long to re-deliuer. I pray you now, receiue them No, no, I neuer gaue you ought My honor'd Lord, I know right well you did, And with them words of so sweet breath compos'd, As made the things more rich, then perfume left: Take these againe, for to the Noble minde Rich gifts wax poore, when giuers proue vnkinde. There my Lord Ha, ha: Are you honest? My Lord Are you faire? What meanes your Lordship? That if you be honest and faire, your Honesty should admit no discourse to your Beautie Could Beautie my Lord, haue better Comerce then your Honestie? I trulie: for the power of Beautie, will sooner transforme Honestie from what is, to a Bawd, then the force of Honestie can translate Beautie into his likenesse. This was sometime a Paradox, but now the time giues it proofe. I did loue you once Indeed my Lord, you made me beleeue so You should not haue beleeued me. For vertue cannot so innocculate our old stocke, but we shall rellish of it. I loued you not I was the more deceiued Get thee to a Nunnerie. Why would'st thou be a breeder of Sinners? I am my selfe indifferent honest, but yet I could accuse me of such things, that it were better my Mother had not borne me. I am very prowd, reuengefull, Ambitious, with more offences at my becke, then I haue thoughts to put them in imagination, to giue them shape, or time to acte them in. What should such Fellowes as I do, crawling betweene Heauen and Earth. We are arrant Knaues all, beleeue none of vs. Goe thy wayes to a Nunnery. Where's your Father? At home, my Lord Let the doores be shut vpon him, that he may play the Foole no way, but in's owne house. Farewell O helpe him, you sweet Heauens If thou doest Marry, Ile giue thee this Plague for thy Dowrie. Be thou as chast as Ice, as pure as Snow, thou shalt not escape Calumny. Get thee to a Nunnery. Go, Farewell. Or if thou wilt needs Marry, marry a fool: for Wise men know well enough, what monsters you make of them. To a Nunnery go, and quickly too. Farwell O heauenly Powers, restore him I haue heard of your pratlings too wel enough. God has giuen you one pace, and you make your selfe another: you gidge, you amble, and you lispe, and nickname Gods creatures, and make your Wantonnesse, your Ignorance. Go too, Ile no more on't, it hath made me mad. I say, we will haue no more Marriages. Those that are married already, all but one shall liue, the rest shall keep as they are. To a Nunnery, go. O what a Noble minde is heere o're-throwne? The Courtiers, Soldiers, Schollers: Eye, tongue, sword, Th' expectansie and Rose of the faire State, The glasse of Fashion, and the mould of Forme, Th' obseru'd of all Obseruers, quite, quite downe. Haue I of Ladies most deiect and wretched, That suck'd the Honie of his Musicke Vowes: Now see that Noble, and most Soueraigne Reason, Like sweet Bels iangled out of tune, and harsh, That vnmatch'd Forme and Feature of blowne youth, Blasted with extasie. Oh woe is me, T'haue seene what I haue seene: see what I see. Loue? His affections do not that way tend, Nor what he spake, though it lack'd Forme a little, Was not like Madnesse. There's something in his soule? O're which his Melancholly sits on brood, And I do doubt the hatch, and the disclose Will be some danger, which to preuent I haue in quicke determination Thus set it downe. He shall with speed to England For the demand of our neglected Tribute: Haply the Seas and Countries different With variable Obiects, shall expell This something setled matter in his heart: Whereon his Braines still beating, puts him thus From fashion of himselfe. What thinke you on't? It shall do well. But yet do I beleeue The Origin and Commencement of this greefe Sprung from neglected loue. How now Ophelia? You neede not tell vs, what Lord Hamlet saide, We heard it all. My Lord, do as you please, But if you hold it fit after the Play, Let his Queene Mother all alone intreat him To shew his Greefes: let her be round with him, And Ile be plac'd so, please you in the eare Of all their Conference. If she finde him not, To England send him: Or confine him where Your wisedome best shall thinke It shall be so: Madnesse in great Ones, must not vnwatch'd go. Speake the Speech I pray you, as I pronounc'd it to you trippingly on the Tongue: But if you mouth it, as many of your Players do, I had as liue the Town-Cryer had spoke my Lines: Nor do not saw the Ayre too much your hand thus, but vse all gently; for in the verie Torrent, Tempest, and (as I say) the Whirle-winde of Passion, you must acquire and beget a Temperance that may giue it Smoothnesse. O it offends mee to the Soule, to see a robustious Pery-wig-pated Fellow, teare a Passion to tatters, to verie ragges, to split the eares of the Groundlings: who (for the most part) are capeable of nothing, but inexplicable dumbe shewes, & noise: I could haue such a Fellow whipt for o're-doing Termagant: it outHerod's Herod. Pray you auoid it I warrant your Honor Be not too tame neyther: but let your owne Discretion be your Tutor. Sute the Action to the Word, the Word to the Action, with this speciall obseruance: That you ore-stop not the modestie of Nature; for any thing so ouer-done, is fro the purpose of Playing, whose end both at the first and now, was and is, to hold as 'twer the Mirrour vp to Nature; to shew Vertue her owne Feature, Scorne her owne Image, and the verie Age and Bodie of the Time, his forme and pressure. Now, this ouer-done, or come tardie off, though it make the vnskilfull laugh, cannot but make the Iudicious greeue; The censure of the which One, must in your allowance o'reway a whole Theater of Others. Oh, there bee Players that I haue seene Play, and heard others praise, and that highly (not to speake it prophanely) that neyther hauing the accent of Christians, nor the gate of Christian, Pagan, or Norman, haue so strutted and bellowed, that I haue thought some of Natures Iouerney-men had made men, and not made them well, they imitated Humanity so abhominably I hope we haue reform'd that indifferently with vs, Sir O reforme it altogether. And let those that play your Clownes, speake no more then is set downe for them. For there be of them, that will themselues laugh, to set on some quantitie of barren Spectators to laugh too, though in the meane time, some necessary Question of the Play be then to be considered: that's Villanous, & shewes a most pittifull Ambition in the Foole that vses it. Go make you readie. How now my Lord, Will the King heare this peece of Worke? And the Queene too, and that presently Bid the Players make hast. Will you two helpe to hasten them? We will my Lord. What hoa, Horatio? Heere sweet Lord, at your Seruice Horatio, thou art eene as iust a man As ere my Conuersation coap'd withall O my deere Lord Nay, do not thinke I flatter: For what aduancement may I hope from thee, That no Reuennew hast, but thy good spirits To feed & cloath thee. Why shold the poor be flatter'd? No, let the Candied tongue, like absurd pompe, And crooke the pregnant Hindges of the knee, Where thrift may follow faining? Dost thou heare, Since my deere Soule was Mistris of my choyse, And could of men distinguish, her election Hath seal'd thee for her selfe. For thou hast bene As one in suffering all, that suffers nothing. A man that Fortunes buffets, and Rewards Hath 'tane with equall Thankes. And blest are those, Whose Blood and Iudgement are so well co-mingled, That they are not a Pipe for Fortunes finger. To sound what stop she please. Giue me that man, That is not Passions Slaue, and I will weare him In my hearts Core. I, in my Heart of heart, As I do thee. Something too much of this. There is a Play to night to before the King. One Scoene of it comes neere the Circumstance Which I haue told thee, of my Fathers death. I prythee, when thou see'st that Acte a-foot, Euen with the verie Comment of my Soule Obserue mine Vnkle: If his occulted guilt, Do not it selfe vnkennell in one speech, It is a damned Ghost that we haue seene: And my Imaginations are as foule As Vulcans Stythe. Giue him needfull note, For I mine eyes will riuet to his Face: And after we will both our iudgements ioyne, To censure of his seeming Well my Lord. If he steale ought the whil'st this Play is Playing, And scape detecting, I will pay the Theft. Guildensterne, and other Lords attendant with his Guard carrying Torches. Danish Sound a Flourish. They are comming to the Play: I must be idle. Get you a place How fares our Cosin Hamlet? Excellent Ifaith, of the Camelions dish: I eate the Ayre promise-cramm'd, you cannot feed Capons so I haue nothing with this answer Hamlet, these words are not mine No, nor mine. Now my Lord, you plaid once i'th' Vniuersity, you say? That I did my Lord, and was accounted a good Actor And what did you enact? I did enact Iulius Caesar, I was kill'd i'th' Capitol: Brutus kill'd me It was a bruite part of him, to kill so Capitall a Calfe there. Be the Players ready? I my Lord, they stay vpon your patience Come hither my good Hamlet, sit by me No good Mother, here's Mettle more attractiue Oh ho, do you marke that? Ladie, shall I lye in your Lap? No my Lord I meane, my Head vpon your Lap? I my Lord Do you thinke I meant Country matters? I thinke nothing, my Lord That's a faire thought to ly betweene Maids legs What is my Lord? Nothing You are merrie, my Lord? Who I? I my Lord Oh God, your onely Iigge-maker: what should a man do, but be merrie. For looke you how cheerefully my Mother lookes, and my Father dyed within's two Houres Nay, 'tis twice two moneths, my Lord So long? Nay then let the Diuel weare blacke, for Ile haue a suite of Sables. Oh Heauens! dye two moneths ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's hope, a great mans Memorie, may out-liue his life halfe a yeare: But byrlady he must builde Churches then: or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with the Hoby-horsse, whose Epitaph is, For o, For o, the Hoby-horse is forgot. Hoboyes play. The dumbe shew enters. him. She kneeles, and makes shew of Protestation vnto him. He takes her vp, and declines his head vpon her neck. Layes him downe vpon a Banke of Flowers. She seeing him a-sleepe, leaues him. Anon comes in a Fellow, takes off his Crowne, kisses it, and powres poyson in the Kings eares, and Queene returnes, findes the King dead, and makes passionate The Poysoner, with some two or three Mutes comes in againe, seeming to lament with her. The dead body is carried away: The Poysoner Wooes the Queene with Gifts, she seemes loath and vnwilling awhile, but in the end, accepts his loue. What meanes this, my Lord? Marry this is Miching Malicho, that meanes Mischeefe Belike this shew imports the Argument of the Play? We shall know by these Fellowes: the Players cannot keepe counsell, they'l tell all Will they tell vs what this shew meant? I, or any shew that you'l shew him. Bee not you asham'd to shew, hee'l not shame to tell you what it meanes You are naught, you are naught, Ile marke the For vs, and for our Tragedie, Heere stooping to your Clemencie: We begge your hearing Patientlie Is this a Prologue, or the Poesie of a Ring? 'Tis briefe my Lord As Womans loue. Full thirtie times hath Phoebus Cart gon round, Neptunes salt Wash, and Tellus Orbed ground: And thirtie dozen Moones with borrowed sheene, About the World haue times twelue thirties beene, Since loue our hearts, and Hymen did our hands Vnite comutuall, in most sacred Bands So many iournies may the Sunne and Moone Make vs againe count o're, ere loue be done. But woe is me, you are so sicke of late, So farre from cheere, and from your former state, That I distrust you: yet though I distrust, Discomfort you (my Lord) it nothing must: For womens Feare and Loue, holds quantitie, In neither ought, or in extremity: Now what my loue is, proofe hath made you know, And as my Loue is siz'd, my Feare is so Faith I must leaue thee Loue, and shortly too: My operant Powers my Functions leaue to do: And thou shalt liue in this faire world behinde, Honour'd, belou'd, and haply, one as kinde. For Husband shalt thou- Oh confound the rest: Such Loue, must needs be Treason in my brest: In second Husband, let me be accurst, None wed the second, but who kill'd the first Wormwood, Wormwood The instances that second Marriage moue, Are base respects of Thrift, but none of Loue. A second time, I kill my Husband dead, When second Husband kisses me in Bed I do beleeue you. Think what now you speak: But what we do determine, oft we breake: Purpose is but the slaue to Memorie, Of violent Birth, but poore validitie: Which now like Fruite vnripe stickes on the Tree, But fall vnshaken, when they mellow bee. Most necessary 'tis, that we forget To pay our selues, what to our selues is debt: What to our selues in passion we propose, The passion ending, doth the purpose lose. The violence of other Greefe or Ioy, Their owne ennactors with themselues destroy: Where Ioy most Reuels, Greefe doth most lament; Greefe ioyes, Ioy greeues on slender accident. This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange That euen our Loues should with our Fortunes change. For 'tis a question left vs yet to proue, Whether Loue lead Fortune, or else Fortune Loue. The great man downe, you marke his fauourites flies, The poore aduanc'd, makes Friends of Enemies: And hitherto doth Loue on Fortune tend, For who not needs, shall neuer lacke a Frend: And who in want a hollow Friend doth try, Directly seasons him his Enemie. But orderly to end, where I begun, Our Willes and Fates do so contrary run, That our Deuices still are ouerthrowne, Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our owne. So thinke thou wilt no second Husband wed. But die thy thoughts, when thy first Lord is dead Nor Earth to giue me food, nor Heauen light, Sport and repose locke from me day and night: Each opposite that blankes the face of ioy, Meet what I would haue well, and it destroy: Both heere, and hence, pursue me lasting strife, If once a Widdow, euer I be Wife If she should breake it now 'Tis deepely sworne: Sweet, leaue me heere a while, My spirits grow dull, and faine I would beguile The tedious day with sleepe Sleepe rocke thy Braine, Sleepes And neuer come mischance betweene vs twaine. Madam, how like you this Play? The Lady protests to much me thinkes Oh but shee'l keepe her word Haue you heard the Argument, is there no Offence in't? No, no, they do but iest, poyson in iest, no Offence i'th' world What do you call the Play? The Mouse-trap: Marry how? Tropically: This Play is the Image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is the Dukes name, his wife Baptista: you shall see anon: 'tis a knauish peece of worke: But what o'that? Your Maiestie, and wee that haue free soules, it touches vs not: let the gall'd iade winch: our withers are vnrung. This is one Lucianus nephew to the King You are a good Chorus, my Lord I could interpret betweene you and your loue: if I could see the Puppets dallying You are keene my Lord, you are keene It would cost you a groaning, to take off my edge Still better and worse So you mistake Husbands. Begin Murderer. Pox, leaue thy damnable Faces, and begin. Come, the croaking Rauen doth bellow for Reuenge Thoughts blacke, hands apt, Drugges fit, and Time agreeing: Confederate season, else, no Creature seeing: Thou mixture ranke, of Midnight Weeds collected, With Hecats Ban, thrice blasted, thrice infected, Thy naturall Magicke, and dire propertie, On wholsome life, vsurpe immediately. Powres the poyson in his eares. He poysons him i'th' Garden for's estate: His name's Gonzago: the Story is extant and writ in choyce You shall see anon how the Murtherer gets the loue of Gonzago's wife The King rises What, frighted with false fire How fares my Lord? Giue o're the Play Giue me some Light. Away Lights, Lights, Lights. Manet Hamlet & Horatio. Why let the strucken Deere go weepe, The Hart vngalled play: For some must watch, while some must sleepe; So runnes the world away. Would not this Sir, and a Forrest of Feathers, if the rest of my Fortunes turne Turke with me; with two Prouinciall Roses on my rac'd Shooes, get me a Fellowship in a crie of Players sir Halfe a share A whole one I, For thou dost know: Oh Damon deere, This Realme dismantled was of Ioue himselfe, And now reignes heere. A verie verie Paiocke You might haue Rim'd Oh good Horatio, Ile take the Ghosts word for a thousand pound. Did'st perceiue? Verie well my Lord Vpon the talke of the poysoning? I did verie well note him. Oh, ha? Come some Musick. Come y Recorders: For if the King like not the Comedie, Why then belike he likes it not perdie. Come some Musicke Good my Lord, vouchsafe me a word with you Sir, a whole History The King, sir I sir, what of him? Is in his retyrement, maruellous distemper'd With drinke Sir? No my Lord, rather with choller Your wisedome should shew it selfe more richer, to signifie this to his Doctor: for for me to put him to his Purgation, would perhaps plundge him into farre more Choller Good my Lord put your discourse into some frame, and start not so wildely from my affayre I am tame Sir, pronounce The Queene your Mother, in most great affliction of spirit, hath sent me to you You are welcome Nay, good my Lord, this courtesie is not of the right breed. If it shall please you to make me a wholsome answer, I will doe your Mothers command'ment: if not, your pardon, and my returne shall bee the end of my Businesse Sir, I cannot What, my Lord? Make you a wholsome answere: my wits diseas'd. But sir, such answers as I can make, you shal command: or rather you say, my Mother: therfore no more but to the matter. My Mother you say Then thus she sayes: your behauior hath stroke her into amazement, and admiration Oh wonderfull Sonne, that can so astonish a But is there no sequell at the heeles of this Mothers admiration? She desires to speake with you in her Closset, ere you go to bed We shall obey, were she ten times our Mother. Haue you any further Trade with vs? My Lord, you once did loue me So I do still, by these pickers and stealers Good my Lord, what is your cause of distemper? You do freely barre the doore of your owne Libertie, if you deny your greefes to your Friend Sir I lacke Aduancement How can that be, when you haue the voyce of the King himselfe, for your Succession in Denmarke? I, but while the grasse growes, the Prouerbe is something musty. O the Recorder. Let me see, to withdraw with you, why do you go about to recouer the winde of mee, as if you would driue me into a toyle? O my Lord, if my Dutie be too bold, my loue is too vnmannerly I do not well vnderstand that. Will you play vpon this Pipe? My Lord, I cannot I pray you Beleeue me, I cannot I do beseech you I know no touch of it, my Lord 'Tis as easie as lying: gouerne these Ventiges with your finger and thumbe, giue it breath with your mouth, and it will discourse most excellent Musicke. Looke you, these are the stoppes But these cannot I command to any vtterance of hermony, I haue not the skill Why looke you now, how vnworthy a thing you make of me: you would play vpon mee; you would seeme to know my stops: you would pluck out the heart of my Mysterie; you would sound mee from my lowest Note, to the top of my Compasse: and there is much Musicke, excellent Voice, in this little Organe, yet cannot you make it. Why do you thinke, that I am easier to bee plaid on, then a Pipe? Call me what Instrument you will, though you can fret me, you cannot play vpon me. God blesse you Sir. My Lord; the Queene would speak with you, and presently Do you see that Clowd? that's almost in shape like a Camell By'th' Masse, and it's like a Camell indeed Me thinkes it is like a Weazell It is back'd like a Weazell Or like a Whale? Verie like a Whale Then will I come to my Mother, by and by: They foole me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by I will say so. By and by, is easily said. Leaue me Friends: 'Tis now the verie witching time of night, When Churchyards yawne, and Hell it selfe breaths out Contagion to this world. Now could I drink hot blood, And do such bitter businesse as the day Would quake to looke on. Soft now, to my Mother: Oh Heart, loose not thy Nature; let not euer The Soule of Nero, enter this firme bosome: Let me be cruell, not vnnaturall, I will speake Daggers to her, but vse none: My Tongue and Soule in this be Hypocrites. How in my words someuer she be shent, To giue them Seales, neuer my Soule consent. I like him not, nor stands it safe with vs, To let his madnesse range. Therefore prepare you, I your Commission will forthwith dispatch, And he to England shall along with you: The termes of our estate, may not endure Hazard so dangerous as doth hourely grow Out of his Lunacies We will our selues prouide: Most holie and Religious feare it is To keepe those many many bodies safe That liue and feede vpon your Maiestie The single And peculiar life is bound With all the strength and Armour of the minde, To keepe it selfe from noyance: but much more, That Spirit, vpon whose spirit depends and rests The liues of many, the cease of Maiestie Dies not alone; but like a Gulfe doth draw What's neere it, with it. It is a massie wheele Fixt on the Somnet of the highest Mount. To whose huge Spoakes, ten thousand lesser things Are mortiz'd and adioyn'd: which when it falles, Each small annexment, pettie consequence Attends the boystrous Ruine. Neuer alone Did the King sighe, but with a generall grone Arme you, I pray you to this speedie Voyage; For we will Fetters put vpon this feare, Which now goes too free-footed We will haste vs. My Lord, he's going to his Mothers Closset: Behinde the Arras Ile conuey my selfe To heare the Processe. Ile warrant shee'l tax him home, And as you said, and wisely was it said, 'Tis meete that some more audience then a Mother, Since Nature makes them partiall, should o're-heare The speech of vantage. Fare you well my Liege, Ile call vpon you ere you go to bed, And tell you what I know Thankes deere my Lord. Oh my offence is ranke, it smels to heauen, It hath the primall eldest curse vpon't, A Brothers murther. Pray can I not, Though inclination be as sharpe as will: My stronger guilt, defeats my strong intent, And like a man to double businesse bound, I stand in pause where I shall first begin, And both neglect; what if this cursed hand Were thicker then it selfe with Brothers blood, Is there not Raine enough in the sweet Heauens To wash it white as Snow? Whereto serues mercy, But to confront the visage of Offence? And what's in Prayer, but this two-fold force, To be fore-stalled ere we come to fall, Or pardon'd being downe? Then Ile looke vp, My fault is past. But oh, what forme of Prayer Can serue my turne? Forgiue me my foule Murther: That cannot be, since I am still possest Of those effects for which I did the Murther. My Crowne, mine owne Ambition, and my Queene: May one be pardon'd, and retaine th' offence? In the corrupted currants of this world, Offences gilded hand may shoue by Iustice, And oft 'tis seene, the wicked prize it selfe Buyes out the Law; but 'tis not so aboue, There is no shuffling, there the Action lyes In his true Nature, and we our selues compell'd Euen to the teeth and forehead of our faults, To giue in euidence. What then? What rests? Try what Repentance can. What can it not? Yet what can it, when one cannot repent? Oh wretched state! Oh bosome, blacke as death! Oh limed soule, that strugling to be free, Art more ingag'd: Helpe Angels, make assay: Bow stubborne knees, and heart with strings of Steele, Be soft as sinewes of the new-borne Babe, All may be well. Now might I do it pat, now he is praying, And now Ile doo't, and so he goes to Heauen, And so am I reueng'd: that would be scann'd, A Villaine killes my Father, and for that I his foule Sonne, do this same Villaine send To heauen. Oh this is hyre and Sallery, not Reuenge. He tooke my Father grossely, full of bread, With all his Crimes broad blowne, as fresh as May, And how his Audit stands, who knowes, saue Heauen: But in our circumstance and course of thought 'Tis heauie with him: and am I then reueng'd, To take him in the purging of his Soule, When he is fit and season'd for his passage? No. Vp Sword, and know thou a more horrid hent When he is drunke asleepe: or in his Rage, Or in th' incestuous pleasure of his bed, At gaming, swearing, or about some acte That ha's no rellish of Saluation in't, Then trip him, that his heeles may kicke at Heauen, And that his Soule may be as damn'd and blacke As Hell, whereto it goes. My Mother stayes, This Physicke but prolongs thy sickly dayes. My words flye vp, my thoughts remain below, Words without thoughts, neuer to Heauen go. He will come straight: Looke you lay home to him, Tell him his prankes haue been too broad to beare with, And that your Grace hath screen'd, and stoode betweene Much heate, and him. Ile silence me e'ene heere: Pray you be round with him within. Mother, mother, mother Ile warrant you, feare me not. Withdraw, I heare him coming. Now Mother, what's the matter? Hamlet, thou hast thy Father much offended Mother, you haue my Father much offended Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue Go, go, you question with an idle tongue Why how now Hamlet? Whats the matter now? Haue you forgot me? No by the Rood, not so: You are the Queene, your Husbands Brothers wife, But would you were not so. You are my Mother Nay, then Ile set those to you that can speake Come, come, and sit you downe, you shall not boudge: You go not till I set you vp a glasse, Where you may see the inmost part of you? What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murther me? Helpe, helpe, hoa What hoa, helpe, helpe, helpe How now, a Rat? dead for a Ducate, dead Oh I am slaine. Killes Polonius Oh me, what hast thou done? Nay I know not, is it the King? Oh what a rash, and bloody deed is this? A bloody deed, almost as bad good Mother, As kill a King, and marrie with his Brother As kill a King? I Lady, 'twas my word. Thou wretched, rash, intruding foole farewell, I tooke thee for thy Betters, take thy Fortune, Thou find'st to be too busie, is some danger. Leaue wringing of your hands, peace, sit you downe, And let me wring your heart, for so I shall If it be made of penetrable stuffe; If damned Custome haue not braz'd it so, That it is proofe and bulwarke against Sense What haue I done, that thou dar'st wag thy tong, In noise so rude against me? Such an Act That blurres the grace and blush of Modestie, Cals Vertue Hypocrite, takes off the Rose From the faire forehead of an innocent loue, And makes a blister there. Makes marriage vowes As false as Dicers Oathes. Oh such a deed, As from the body of Contraction pluckes The very soule, and sweete Religion makes A rapsidie of words. Heauens face doth glow, Yea this solidity and compound masse, With tristfull visage as against the doome, Is thought-sicke at the act Aye me; what act, that roares so lowd, & thunders in the Index Looke heere vpon this Picture, and on this, The counterfet presentment of two Brothers: See what a grace was seated on his Brow, Hyperions curles, the front of Ioue himselfe, An eye like Mars, to threaten or command A Station, like the Herald Mercurie New lighted on a heauen-kissing hill: A Combination, and a forme indeed, Where euery God did seeme to set his Seale, To giue the world assurance of a man. This was your Husband. Looke you now what followes. Heere is your Husband, like a Mildew'd eare Blasting his wholsom breath. Haue you eyes? Could you on this faire Mountaine leaue to feed, And batten on this Moore? Ha? Haue you eyes? You cannot call it Loue: For at your age, The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble, And waites vpon the Iudgement: and what Iudgement Would step from this, to this? What diuell was't, That thus hath cousend you at hoodman-blinde? O Shame! where is thy Blush? Rebellious Hell, If thou canst mutine in a Matrons bones, To flaming youth, let Vertue be as waxe. And melt in her owne fire. Proclaime no shame, When the compulsiue Ardure giues the charge, Since Frost it selfe, as actiuely doth burne, As Reason panders Will O Hamlet, speake no more. Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soule, And there I see such blacke and grained spots, As will not leaue their Tinct Nay, but to liue In the ranke sweat of an enseamed bed, Stew'd in Corruption; honying and making loue Ouer the nasty Stye Oh speake to me, no more, These words like Daggers enter in mine eares. No more sweet Hamlet A Murderer, and a Villaine: A Slaue, that is not twentieth part the tythe Of your precedent Lord. A vice of Kings, A Cutpurse of the Empire and the Rule. That from a shelfe, the precious Diadem stole, And put it in his Pocket No more. A King of shreds and patches. Saue me; and houer o're me with your wings You heauenly Guards. What would your gracious figure? Alas he's mad Do you not come your tardy Sonne to chide, That laps't in Time and Passion, lets go by Th' important acting of your dread command? Oh say Do not forget: this Visitation Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose. But looke, Amazement on thy Mother sits; O step betweene her, and her fighting Soule, Conceit in weakest bodies, strongest workes. Speake to her Hamlet How is it with you Lady? Alas, how is't with you? That you bend your eye on vacancie, And with their corporall ayre do hold discourse. Forth at your eyes, your spirits wildely peepe, And as the sleeping Soldiours in th' Alarme, Your bedded haire, like life in excrements, Start vp, and stand an end. Oh gentle Sonne, Vpon the heate and flame of thy distemper Sprinkle coole patience. Whereon do you looke? On him, on him: look you how pale he glares, His forme and cause conioyn'd, preaching to stones, Would make them capeable. Do not looke vpon me, Least with this pitteous action you conuert My sterne effects: then what I haue to do, Will want true colour; teares perchance for blood To who do you speake this? Do you see nothing there? Nothing at all, yet all that is I see Nor did you nothing heare? No, nothing but our selues Why look you there: looke how it steals away: My Father in his habite, as he liued, Looke where he goes euen now out at the Portall. This is the very coynage of your Braine, This bodilesse Creation extasie is very cunning in Extasie? My Pulse as yours doth temperately keepe time, And makes as healthfull Musicke. It is not madnesse That I haue vttered; bring me to the Test And I the matter will re-word: which madnesse Would gamboll from. Mother, for loue of Grace, Lay not a flattering Vnction to your soule, That not your trespasse, but my madnesse speakes: It will but skin and filme the Vlcerous place, Whil'st ranke Corruption mining all within, Infects vnseene. Confesse your selfe to Heauen, Repent what's past, auoyd what is to come, And do not spred the Compost on the Weedes, To make them ranke. Forgiue me this my Vertue, For in the fatnesse of this pursie times, Vertue it selfe, of Vice must pardon begge, Yea courb, and woe, for leaue to do him good Oh Hamlet, Thou hast cleft my heart in twaine O throw away the worser part of it, And liue the purer with the other halfe. Good night, but go not to mine Vnkles bed, Assume a Vertue, if you haue it not, refraine to night, And that shall lend a kinde of easinesse To the next abstinence. Once more goodnight, And when you are desirous to be blest, Ile blessing begge of you. For this same Lord, I do repent: but heauen hath pleas'd it so, To punish me with this, and this with me, That I must be their Scourge and Minister. I will bestow him, and will answer well The death I gaue him: so againe, good night. I must be cruell, onely to be kinde; Thus bad begins and worse remaines behinde What shall I do? Not this by no meanes that I bid you do: Let the blunt King tempt you againe to bed, Pinch Wanton on your cheeke, call you his Mouse, And let him for a paire of reechie kisses, Or padling in your necke with his damn'd Fingers, Make you to rauell all this matter out, That I essentially am not in madnesse, But made in craft. 'Twere good you let him know, For who that's but a Queene, faire, sober, wise, Would from a Paddocke, from a Bat, a Gibbe, Such deere concernings hide, Who would do so, No in despight of Sense and Secrecie, Vnpegge the Basket on the houses top: Let the Birds flye, and like the famous Ape To try Conclusions in the Basket, creepe And breake your owne necke downe Be thou assur'd, if words be made of breath, And breath of life: I haue no life to breath What thou hast saide to me I must to England, you know that? Alacke I had forgot: 'Tis so concluded on This man shall set me packing: Ile lugge the Guts into the Neighbor roome, Mother goodnight. Indeede this Counsellor Is now most still, most secret, and most graue, Who was in life, a foolish prating Knaue. Come sir, to draw toward an end with you. Good night Mother. There's matters in these sighes. These profound heaues You must translate; Tis fit we vnderstand them. Where is your Sonne? Ah my good Lord, what haue I seene to night? What Gertrude? How do's Hamlet? Mad as the Seas, and winde, when both contend Which is the Mightier, in his lawlesse fit Behinde the Arras, hearing something stirre, He whips his Rapier out, and cries a Rat, a Rat, And in his brainish apprehension killes The vnseene good old man Oh heauy deed: It had bin so with vs had we beene there: His Liberty is full of threats to all, To you your selfe, to vs, to euery one. Alas, how shall this bloody deede be answered? It will be laide to vs, whose prouidence Should haue kept short, restrain'd, and out of haunt, This mad yong man. But so much was our loue, We would not vnderstand what was most fit, But like the Owner of a foule disease, To keepe it from divulging, let's it feede Euen on the pith of life. Where is he gone? To draw apart the body he hath kild, O're whom his very madnesse like some Oare Among a Minerall of Mettels base Shewes it selfe pure. He weepes for what is done Oh Gertrude, come away: The Sun no sooner shall the Mountaines touch, But we will ship him hence, and this vilde deed, We must with all our Maiesty and Skill Both countenance, and excuse. Ho Guildenstern: Friends both go ioyne you with some further ayde: Hamlet in madnesse hath Polonius slaine, And from his Mother Clossets hath he drag'd him. Go seeke him out, speake faire, and bring the body Into the Chappell. I pray you hast in this. Come Gertrude, wee'l call vp our wisest friends, To let them know both what we meane to do, And what's vntimely done. Oh come away, My soule is full of discord and dismay. Safely stowed Gentlemen within. Hamlet, Lord Hamlet What noise? Who cals on Hamlet? Oh heere they come. What haue you done my Lord with the dead body? Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis Kinne Tell vs where 'tis, that we may take it thence, And beare it to the Chappell Do not beleeue it Beleeue what? That I can keepe your counsell, and not mine owne. Besides, to be demanded of a Spundge, what replication should be made by the Sonne of a King Take you me for a Spundge, my Lord? I sir, that sokes vp the Kings Countenance, his Rewards, his Authorities (but such Officers do the King best seruice in the end. He keepes them like an Ape in the corner of his iaw, first mouth'd to be last swallowed, when he needes what you haue glean'd, it is but squeezing you, and Spundge you shall be dry againe I vnderstand you not my Lord I am glad of it: a knauish speech sleepes in a foolish eare My Lord, you must tell vs where the body is, and go with vs to the King The body is with the King, but the King is not with the body. The King, is a thing- A thing my Lord? Of nothing: bring me to him, hide Fox, and all after. I haue sent to seeke him, and to find the bodie: How dangerous is it that this man goes loose: Yet must not we put the strong Law on him: Hee's loued of the distracted multitude, Who like not in their iudgement, but their eyes: And where 'tis so, th' Offenders scourge is weigh'd But neerer the offence: to beare all smooth, and euen, This sodaine sending him away, must seeme Deliberate pause, diseases desperate growne, By desperate appliance are releeued, Or not at all. How now? What hath befalne? Where the dead body is bestow'd my Lord, We cannot get from him But where is he? Without my Lord, guarded to know your pleasure Bring him before vs Hoa, Guildensterne? Bring in my Lord. Now Hamlet, where's Polonius? At Supper At Supper? Where? Not where he eats, but where he is eaten, a certaine conuocation of wormes are e'ne at him. Your worm is your onely Emperor for diet. We fat all creatures else to fat vs, and we fat our selfe for Magots. Your fat King, and your leane Begger is but variable seruice to dishes, but to one Table that's the end What dost thou meane by this? Nothing but to shew you how a King may go a Progresse through the guts of a Begger Where is Polonius In heauen, send thither to see. If your Messenger finde him not there, seeke him i'th other place your selfe: but indeed, if you finde him not this moneth, you shall nose him as you go vp the staires into the Lobby Go seeke him there He will stay till ye come Hamlet, this deed of thine, for thine especial safety Which we do tender, as we deerely greeue For that which thou hast done, must send thee hence With fierie Quicknesse. Therefore prepare thy selfe, The Barke is readie, and the winde at helpe, Th' Associates tend, and euery thing at bent For England For England? I Hamlet Good So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes I see a Cherube that see's him: but come, for Farewell deere Mother Thy louing Father Hamlet My Mother: Father and Mother is man and wife: man & wife is one flesh, and so my mother. Come, for England. Follow him at foote, Tempt him with speed aboord: Delay it not, Ile haue him hence to night. Away, for euery thing is Seal'd and done That else leanes on th' Affaire, pray you make hast. And England, if my loue thou holdst at ought, As my great power thereof may giue thee sense, Since yet thy Cicatrice lookes raw and red After the Danish Sword, and thy free awe Payes homage to vs; thou maist not coldly set Our Soueraigne Processe, which imports at full By Letters coniuring to that effect The present death of Hamlet. Do it England, For like the Hecticke in my blood he rages, And thou must cure me: Till I know 'tis done, How ere my happes, my ioyes were ne're begun. Go Captaine, from me greet the Danish King, Tell him that by his license, Fortinbras Claimes the conueyance of a promis'd March Ouer his Kingdome. You know the Rendeuous: If that his Maiesty would ought with vs, We shall expresse our dutie in his eye, And let him know so I will doo't, my Lord Go safely on. I will not speake with her She is importunate, indeed distract, her moode will needs be pittied What would she haue? She speakes much of her Father; saies she heares There's trickes i'th' world, and hems, and beats her heart, Spurnes enuiously at Strawes, speakes things in doubt, That carry but halfe sense: Her speech is nothing, Yet the vnshaped vse of it doth moue The hearers to Collection; they ayme at it, And botch the words vp fit to their owne thoughts, Which as her winkes, and nods, and gestures yeeld them, Indeed would make one thinke there would be thought, Though nothing sure, yet much vnhappily 'Twere good she were spoken with, For she may strew dangerous coniectures In ill breeding minds. Let her come in. To my sicke soule (as sinnes true Nature is) Each toy seemes Prologue, to some great amisse, So full of Artlesse iealousie is guilt, It spill's it selfe, in fearing to be spilt. Where is the beauteous Maiesty of Denmark How now Ophelia? How should I your true loue know from another one? By his Cockle hat and staffe, and his Sandal shoone Alas sweet Lady: what imports this Song? Say you? Nay pray you marke. He is dead and gone Lady, he is dead and gone, At his head a grasse-greene Turfe, at his heeles a stone. Nay but Ophelia Pray you marke. White his Shrow'd as the Mountaine Snow Alas, looke heere my Lord Larded with sweet Flowers: Which bewept to the graue did not go, With true-loue showres How do ye, pretty Lady? Well, God dil'd you. They say the Owle was a Bakers daughter. Lord, wee know what we are, but know not what we may be. God be at your Table Conceit vpon her Father Pray you let's haue no words of this: but when they aske you what it meanes, say you this: To morrow is S. Valentines day, all in the morning betime, And I a Maid at your Window, to be your Valentine. Then vp he rose, & don'd his clothes, & dupt the chamber dore, Let in the Maid, that out a Maid, neuer departed more Pretty Ophelia Indeed la? without an oath Ile make an end ont. By gis, and by S. Charity, Alacke, and fie for shame: Yong men wil doo't, if they come too't, By Cocke they are too blame. Quoth she before you tumbled me, You promis'd me to Wed: So would I ha done by yonder Sunne, And thou hadst not come to my bed How long hath she bin thus? I hope all will be well. We must bee patient, but I cannot choose but weepe, to thinke they should lay him i'th' cold ground: My brother shall knowe of it, and so I thanke you for your good counsell. Come, my Coach: Goodnight Ladies: Goodnight sweet Ladies: Goodnight, goodnight. Follow her close, Giue her good watch I pray you: Oh this is the poyson of deepe greefe, it springs All from her Fathers death. Oh Gertrude, Gertrude, When sorrowes comes, they come not single spies, But in Battalians. First, her Father slaine, Next your Sonne gone, and he most violent Author Of his owne iust remoue: the people muddied, Thicke and vnwholsome in their thoughts, and whispers For good Polonius death; and we haue done but greenly In hugger mugger to interre him. Poore Ophelia Diuided from her selfe, and her faire Iudgement, Without the which we are Pictures, or meere Beasts. Last, and as much containing as all these, Her Brother is in secret come from France, Keepes on his wonder, keepes himselfe in clouds, And wants not Buzzers to infect his eare With pestilent Speeches of his Fathers death, Where in necessitie of matter Beggard, Will nothing sticke our persons to Arraigne In eare and eare. O my deere Gertrude, this, Like to a murdering Peece in many places, Giues me superfluous death. A Noise within. Alacke, what noyse is this? Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the doore. What is the matter? Saue your selfe, my Lord. The Ocean (ouer-peering of his List) Eates not the Flats with more impittious haste Then young Laertes, in a Riotous head, Ore-beares your Officers, the rabble call him Lord, And as the world were now but to begin, Antiquity forgot, Custome not knowne, The Ratifiers and props of euery word, They cry choose we? Laertes shall be King, Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds, Laertes shall be King, Laertes King How cheerefully on the false Traile they cry, Oh this is Counter you false Danish Dogges. Noise within. Enter Laertes. The doores are broke Where is the King, sirs? Stand you all without No, let's come in I pray you giue me leaue We will, we will I thanke you: Keepe the doore. Oh thou vilde King, giue me my Father Calmely good Laertes That drop of blood, that calmes Proclaimes me Bastard: Cries Cuckold to my Father, brands the Harlot Euen heere betweene the chaste vnsmirched brow Of my true Mother What is the cause Laertes, That thy Rebellion lookes so Gyant-like? Let him go Gertrude: Do not feare our person: There's such Diuinity doth hedge a King, That Treason can but peepe to what it would, Acts little of his will. Tell me Laertes, Why thou art thus Incenst? Let him go Gertrude. Speake man Where's my Father? Dead But not by him Let him demand his fill How came he dead? Ile not be Iuggel'd with. To hell Allegeance: Vowes, to the blackest diuell. Conscience and Grace, to the profoundest Pit. I dare Damnation: to this point I stand, That both the worlds I giue to negligence, Let come what comes: onely Ile be reueng'd Most throughly for my Father Who shall stay you? My Will, not all the world, And for my meanes, Ile husband them so well, They shall go farre with little Good Laertes: If you desire to know the certaintie Of your deere Fathers death, if writ in your reuenge, That Soop-stake you will draw both Friend and Foe, Winner and Looser None but his Enemies Will you know them then To his good Friends, thus wide Ile ope my Armes: And like the kinde Life-rend'ring Politician, Repast them with my blood Why now you speake Like a good Childe, and a true Gentleman. That I am guiltlesse of your Fathers death, And am most sensible in greefe for it, It shall as leuell to your Iudgement pierce As day do's to your eye. A noise within. Let her come in. How now? what noise is that? Oh heate drie vp my Braines, teares seuen times salt, Burne out the Sence and Vertue of mine eye. By Heauen, thy madnesse shall be payed by waight, Till our Scale turnes the beame. Oh Rose of May, Deere Maid, kinde Sister, sweet Ophelia: Oh Heauens, is't possible, a yong Maids wits, Should be as mortall as an old mans life? Nature is fine in Loue, and where 'tis fine, It sends some precious instance of it selfe After the thing it loues They bore him bare fac'd on the Beer, Hey non nony, nony, hey nony: And on his graue raines many a teare, Fare you well my Doue Had'st thou thy wits, and did'st perswade Reuenge, it could not moue thus You must sing downe a-downe, and you call him a-downe-a. Oh, how the wheele becomes it? It is the false Steward that stole his masters daughter This nothings more then matter There's Rosemary, that's for Remembraunce. Pray loue remember: and there is Paconcies, that's for Thoughts A document in madnesse, thoughts & remembrance fitted There's Fennell for you, and Columbines: ther's Rew for you, and heere's some for me. Wee may call it Herbe-Grace a Sundaies: Oh you must weare your Rew with a difference. There's a Daysie, I would giue you some Violets, but they wither'd all when my Father dyed: They say, he made a good end; For bonny sweet Robin is all my ioy Thought, and Affliction, Passion, Hell it selfe: She turnes to Fauour, and to prettinesse And will he not come againe, And will he not come againe: No, no, he is dead, go to thy Death-bed, He neuer wil come againe. His Beard as white as Snow, All Flaxen was his Pole: He is gone, he is gone, and we cast away mone, Gramercy on his Soule. And of all Christian Soules, I pray God. God buy ye. Do you see this, you Gods? Laertes, I must common with your greefe, Or you deny me right: go but apart, Make choice of whom your wisest Friends you will, And they shall heare and iudge 'twixt you and me; If by direct or by Colaterall hand They finde vs touch'd, we will our Kingdome giue, Our Crowne, our Life, and all that we call Ours To you in satisfaction. But if not, Be you content to lend your patience to vs, And we shall ioyntly labour with your soule To giue it due content Let this be so: His meanes of death, his obscure buriall; No Trophee, Sword, nor Hatchment o're his bones, No Noble rite, nor formall ostentation, Cry to be heard, as 'twere from Heauen to Earth, That I must call in question So you shall: And where th' offence is, let the great Axe fall. I pray you go with me. What are they that would speake with me? Saylors sir, they say they haue Letters for you Let them come in, I do not know from what part of the world I should be greeted, if not from Lord Hamlet. God blesse you Sir Let him blesse thee too Hee shall Sir, and't please him. There's a Letter for you Sir: It comes from th' Ambassadours that was bound for England, if your name be Horatio, as I am let to know it is. Reads the Letter. Horatio, When thou shalt haue ouerlook'd this, giue these Fellowes some meanes to the King: They haue Letters for him. Ere we were two dayes old at Sea, a Pyrate of very Warlicke appointment gaue vs Chace. Finding our selues too slow of Saile, we put on a compelled Valour. In the Grapple, I boorded them: On the instant they got cleare of our Shippe, so I alone became their Prisoner. They haue dealt with mee, like Theeues of Mercy, but they knew what they did. I am to doe a good turne for them. Let the King haue the Letters I haue sent, and repaire thou to me with as much hast as thou wouldest flye death. I haue words to speake in your eare, will make thee dumbe, yet are they much too light for the bore of the Matter. These good Fellowes will bring thee where I am. Rosincrance and Guildensterne, hold their course for England. Of them I haue much to tell thee, Farewell. He that thou knowest thine, Come, I will giue you way for these your Letters, And do't the speedier, that you may direct me To him from whom you brought them. Now must your conscience my acquittance seal, And you must put me in your heart for Friend, Sith you haue heard, and with a knowing eare, That he which hath your Noble Father slaine, Pursued my life It well appeares. But tell me, Why you proceeded not against these feates, So crimefull, and so Capitall in Nature, As by your Safety, Wisedome, all things else, You mainly were stirr'd vp? O for two speciall Reasons, Which may to you (perhaps) seeme much vnsinnowed, And yet to me they are strong. The Queen his Mother, Liues almost by his lookes: and for my selfe, My Vertue or my Plague, be it either which, She's so coniunctiue to my life, and soule; That as the Starre moues not but in his Sphere, I could not but by her. The other Motiue, Why to a publike count I might not go, Is the great loue the generall gender beare him, Who dipping all his Faults in their affection, Would like the Spring that turneth Wood to Stone, Conuert his Gyues to Graces. So that my Arrowes Too slightly timbred for so loud a Winde, Would haue reuerted to my Bow againe, And not where I had arm'd them And so haue I a Noble Father lost, A Sister driuen into desperate tearmes, Who was (if praises may go backe againe) Stood Challenger on mount of all the Age For her perfections. But my reuenge will come Breake not your sleepes for that, You must not thinke That we are made of stuffe, so flat, and dull, That we can let our Beard be shooke with danger, And thinke it pastime. You shortly shall heare more, I lou'd your Father, and we loue our Selfe, And that I hope will teach you to imagine- How now? What Newes? Letters my Lord from Hamlet, This to your Maiesty: this to the Queene From Hamlet? Who brought them? Saylors my Lord they say, I saw them not: They were giuen me by Claudio, he receiu'd them Laertes you shall heare them: Leaue vs. High and Mighty, you shall know I am set naked on your To morrow shall I begge leaue to see your Kingly When I shall (first asking your Pardon thereunto) recount th' Occasions of my sodaine, and more strange returne. What should this meane? Are all the rest come backe? Or is it some abuse? Or no such thing? Know you the hand? 'Tis Hamlets Character, naked and in a Postscript here he sayes alone: Can you aduise me? I'm lost in it my Lord; but let him come, It warmes the very sicknesse in my heart, That I shall liue and tell him to his teeth; Thus diddest thou If it be so Laertes, as how should it be so: How otherwise will you be rul'd by me? If so you'l not o'rerule me to a peace To thine owne peace: if he be now return'd, As checking at his Voyage, and that he meanes No more to vndertake it; I will worke him To an exployt now ripe in my Deuice, Vnder the which he shall not choose but fall; And for his death no winde of blame shall breath, But euen his Mother shall vncharge the practice, And call it accident: Some two Monthes hence Here was a Gentleman of Normandy, I'ue seene my selfe, and seru'd against the French, And they ran well on Horsebacke; but this Gallant Had witchcraft in't; he grew into his Seat, And to such wondrous doing brought his Horse, As had he beene encorps't and demy-Natur'd With the braue Beast, so farre he past my thought, That I in forgery of shapes and trickes, Come short of what he did A Norman was't? A Norman Vpon my life Lamound The very same I know him well, he is the Brooch indeed, And Iemme of all our Nation Hee mad confession of you, And gaue you such a Masterly report, For Art and exercise in your defence; And for your Rapier most especiall, That he cryed out, t'would be a sight indeed, If one could match you Sir. This report of his Did Hamlet so envenom with his Enuy, That he could nothing doe but wish and begge, Your sodaine comming ore to play with him; Now out of this Why out of this, my Lord? Laertes was your Father deare to you? Or are you like the painting of a sorrow, A face without a heart? Why aske you this? Not that I thinke you did not loue your Father, But that I know Loue is begun by Time: And that I see in passages of proofe, Time qualifies the sparke and fire of it: Hamlet comes backe: what would you vndertake, To show your selfe your Fathers sonne indeed, More then in words? To cut his throat i'th' Church No place indeed should murder Sancturize; Reuenge should haue no bounds: but good Laertes Will you doe this, keepe close within your Chamber, Hamlet return'd, shall know you are come home: Wee'l put on those shall praise your excellence, And set a double varnish on the fame The Frenchman gaue you, bring you in fine together, And wager on your heads, he being remisse, Most generous, and free from all contriuing, Will not peruse the Foiles? So that with ease, Or with a little shuffling, you may choose A Sword vnbaited, and in a passe of practice, Requit him for your Father I will doo't. And for that purpose Ile annoint my Sword: I bought an Vnction of a Mountebanke So mortall, I but dipt a knife in it, Where it drawes blood, no Cataplasme so rare, Collected from all Simples that haue Vertue Vnder the Moone, can saue the thing from death, That is but scratcht withall: Ile touch my point, With this contagion, that if I gall him slightly, It may be death Let's further thinke of this, Weigh what conuenience both of time and meanes May fit vs to our shape, if this should faile; And that our drift looke through our bad performance, 'Twere better not assaid; therefore this Proiect Should haue a backe or second, that might hold, If this should blast in proofe: Soft, let me see Wee'l make a solemne wager on your commings, I ha't: when in your motion you are hot and dry, As make your bowts more violent to the end, And that he cals for drinke; Ile haue prepar'd him A Challice for the nonce; whereon but sipping, If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck, Our purpose may hold there; how sweet Queene. One woe doth tread vpon anothers heele, So fast they'l follow: your Sister's drown'd Laertes Drown'd! O where? There is a Willow growes aslant a Brooke, That shewes his hore leaues in the glassie streame: There with fantasticke Garlands did she come, Of Crow-flowers, Nettles, Daysies, and long Purples, That liberall Shepheards giue a grosser name; But our cold Maids doe Dead Mens Fingers call them: There on the pendant boughes, her Coronet weeds Clambring to hang; an enuious sliuer broke, When downe the weedy Trophies, and her selfe, Fell in the weeping Brooke, her cloathes spred wide, And Mermaid-like, a while they bore her vp, Which time she chaunted snatches of old tunes, As one incapable of her owne distresse, Or like a creature Natiue, and indued Vnto that Element: but long it could not be, Till that her garments, heauy with her drinke, Pul'd the poore wretch from her melodious buy, To muddy death Alas then, is she drown'd? Drown'd, drown'd Too much of water hast thou poore Ophelia, And therefore I forbid my teares: but yet It is our tricke, Nature her custome holds, Let shame say what it will; when these are gone The woman will be out: Adue my Lord, I haue a speech of fire, that faine would blaze, But that this folly doubts it. Let's follow, Gertrude: How much I had to doe to calme his rage? Now feare I this will giue it start againe; Therefore let's follow. Is she to bee buried in Christian buriall, that wilfully seekes her owne saluation? I tell thee she is, and therefore make her Graue straight, the Crowner hath sate on her, and finds it Christian buriall How can that be, vnlesse she drowned her selfe in her owne defence? Why 'tis found so It must be Se offendendo, it cannot bee else: for heere lies the point; If I drowne my selfe wittingly, it argues an Act: and an Act hath three branches. It is an Act to doe and to performe; argall she drown'd her selfe wittingly Nay but heare you Goodman Deluer Giue me leaue; heere lies the water; good: heere stands the man; good: If the man goe to this water and drowne himselfe; it is will he nill he, he goes; marke you that? But if the water come to him & drowne him; hee drownes not himselfe. Argall, hee that is not guilty of his owne death, shortens not his owne life But is this law? I marry is't, Crowners Quest Law Will you ha the truth on't: if this had not beene a Gentlewoman, shee should haue beene buried out of Christian Buriall Why there thou say'st. And the more pitty that great folke should haue countenance in this world to drowne or hang themselues, more then their euen Christian. Come, my Spade; there is no ancient Gentlemen, but Gardiners, Ditchers and Graue-makers; they hold vp Adams Profession Was he a Gentleman? He was the first that euer bore Armes Why he had none What, ar't a Heathen? how doth thou vnderstand the Scripture? the Scripture sayes Adam dig'd; could hee digge without Armes? Ile put another question to thee; if thou answerest me not to the purpose, confesse thy selfe- Go too What is he that builds stronger then either the Mason, the Shipwright, or the Carpenter? The Gallowes maker; for that Frame outliues a thousand Tenants I like thy wit well in good faith, the Gallowes does well; but how does it well? it does well to those that doe ill: now, thou dost ill to say the Gallowes is built stronger then the Church: Argall, the Gallowes may doe well to thee. Too't againe, Come Who builds stronger then a Mason, a Shipwright, or a Carpenter? I, tell me that, and vnyoake Marry, now I can tell Too't Masse, I cannot tell. Cudgell thy braines no more about it; for your dull Asse will not mend his pace with beating; and when you are ask't this question next, say a Graue-maker: the Houses that he makes, lasts till Doomesday: go, get thee to Yaughan, fetch me a stoupe of Liquor. In youth when I did loue, did loue, me thought it was very sweete: To contract O the time for a my behoue, O me thought there was nothing meete Ha's this fellow no feeling of his businesse, that he sings at Graue-making? Custome hath made it in him a property of easinesse 'Tis ee'n so; the hand of little Imployment hath the daintier sense Clowne sings. But Age with his stealing steps hath caught me in his clutch: And hath shipped me intill the Land, as if I had neuer beene such That Scull had a tongue in it, and could sing once: how the knaue iowles it to th' grownd, as if it were Caines Iaw-bone, that did the first murther: It might be the Pate of a Polititian which this Asse o're Offices: one that could circumuent God, might it not? It might, my Lord Or of a Courtier, which could say, Good Morrow sweet Lord: how dost thou, good Lord? this might be my Lord such a one, that prais'd my Lord such a ones Horse, when he meant to begge it; might it not? I, my Lord Why ee'n so: and now my Lady Wormes, Chaplesse, and knockt about the Mazard with a Sextons Spade; heere's fine Reuolution, if wee had the tricke to see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding, but to play at Loggets with 'em? mine ake to thinke on't Clowne sings. A Pickhaxe and a Spade, a Spade, for and a shrowding-Sheete: O a Pit of Clay for to be made, for such a Guest is meete There's another: why might not that bee the Scull of a Lawyer? where be his Quiddits now? his Quillets? his Cases? his Tenures, and his Tricks? why doe's he suffer this rude knaue now to knocke him about the Sconce with a dirty Shouell, and will not tell him of his Action of Battery? hum. This fellow might be in's time a great buyer of Land, with his Statutes, his Recognizances, his Fines, his double Vouchers, his Recoueries: Is this the fine of his Fines, and the recouery of his Recoueries, to haue his fine Pate full of fine Dirt? will his Vouchers vouch him no more of his Purchases, and double ones too, then the length and breadth of a paire of Indentures? the very Conueyances of his Lands will hardly lye in this Boxe; and must the Inheritor himselfe haue no more? ha? Not a iot more, my Lord Is not Parchment made of Sheep-skinnes? I my Lord, and of Calue-skinnes too They are Sheepe and Calues that seek out assurance in that. I will speake to this fellow: whose Graue's this Sir? Mine Sir: O a Pit of Clay for to be made, for such a Guest is meete I thinke it be thine indeed: for thou liest in't You lye out on't Sir, and therefore it is not yours: for my part, I doe not lye in't; and yet it is mine Thou dost lye in't, to be in't and say 'tis thine: 'tis for the dead, not for the quicke, therefore thou lyest 'Tis a quicke lye Sir, 'twill away againe from me to you What man dost thou digge it for? For no man Sir What woman then? For none neither Who is to be buried in't? One that was a woman Sir; but rest her Soule, shee's dead How absolute the knaue is? wee must speake by the Carde, or equiuocation will vndoe vs: by the Lord Horatio, these three yeares I haue taken note of it, the Age is growne so picked, that the toe of the Pesant comes so neere the heeles of our Courtier, hee galls his How long hast thou been a Graue-maker? Of all the dayes i'th' yeare, I came too't that day that our last King Hamlet o'recame Fortinbras How long is that since? Cannot you tell that? euery foole can tell that: It was the very day, that young Hamlet was borne, hee that was mad, and sent into England I marry, why was he sent into England? Why, because he was mad; hee shall recouer his wits there; or if he do not, it's no great matter there Why? 'Twill not be seene in him, there the men are as mad as he How came he mad? Very strangely they say How strangely? Faith e'ene with loosing his wits Vpon what ground? Why heere in Denmarke: I haue bin sixeteene heere, man and Boy thirty yeares How long will a man lie i'th' earth ere he rot? Ifaith, if he be not rotten before he die (as we haue many pocky Coarses now adaies, that will scarce hold the laying in) he will last you some eight yeare, or nine yeare. A Tanner will last you nine yeare Why he, more then another? Why sir, his hide is so tan'd with his Trade, that he will keepe out water a great while. And your water, is a sore Decayer of your horson dead body. Heres a Scull now: this Scul, has laine in the earth three & twenty years Whose was it? A whoreson mad Fellowes it was; Whose doe you thinke it was? Nay, I know not A pestilence on him for a mad Rogue, a pour'd a Flaggon of Renish on my head once. This same Scull Sir, this same Scull sir, was Yoricks Scull, the Kings Iester This? E'ene that Let me see. Alas poore Yorick, I knew him Horatio, a fellow of infinite Iest; of most excellent fancy, he hath borne me on his backe a thousand times: And how abhorred my Imagination is, my gorge rises at it. Heere hung those lipps, that I haue kist I know not how oft. Where be your Iibes now? Your Gambals? Your Songs? Your flashes of Merriment that were wont to set the Table on a Rore? No one now to mock your own Ieering? Quite chopfalne? Now get you to my Ladies Chamber, and tell her, let her paint an inch thicke, to this fauour she must come. Make her laugh at that: prythee Horatio tell me one thing What's that my Lord? Dost thou thinke Alexander lookt o'this fashion i'th' earth? E'ene so And smelt so? Puh E'ene so, my Lord To what base vses we may returne Horatio. Why may not Imagination trace the Noble dust of Alexander, till he find it stopping a bunghole 'Twere to consider: to curiously to consider so No faith, not a iot. But to follow him thether with modestie enough, & likeliehood to lead it; as thus. Alexander died: Alexander was buried: Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of earth we make Lome, and why of that Lome (whereto he was conuerted) might they not stopp a Beere-barrell? Imperiall Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay, Might stop a hole to keepe the winde away. Oh, that that earth, which kept the world in awe, Should patch a Wall, t' expell the winters flaw. But soft, but soft, aside; heere comes the King. The Queene, the Courtiers. Who is that they follow, And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken, The Coarse they follow, did with disperate hand, Fore do it owne life; 'twas some Estate. Couch we a while, and mark What Cerimony else? That is Laertes, a very Noble youth: Marke What Cerimony else? Her Obsequies haue bin as farre inlarg'd. As we haue warrantie, her death was doubtfull, And but that great Command, o're-swaies the order, She should in ground vnsanctified haue lodg'd, Till the last Trumpet. For charitable praier, Shardes, Flints, and Peebles, should be throwne on her: Yet heere she is allowed her Virgin Rites, Her Maiden strewments, and the bringing home Of Bell and Buriall Must there no more be done ? No more be done: We should prophane the seruice of the dead, To sing sage Requiem, and such rest to her As to peace-parted Soules Lay her i'th' earth, And from her faire and vnpolluted flesh, May Violets spring. I tell thee (churlish Priest) A Ministring Angell shall my Sister be, When thou liest howling? What, the faire Ophelia? Sweets, to the sweet farewell. I hop'd thou should'st haue bin my Hamlets wife: I thought thy Bride-bed to haue deckt (sweet Maid) And not t'haue strew'd thy Graue Oh terrible woer, Fall ten times trebble, on that cursed head Whose wicked deed, thy most Ingenious sence Depriu'd thee of. Hold off the earth a while, Till I haue caught her once more in mine armes: Leaps in the graue. Now pile your dust, vpon the quicke, and dead, Till of this flat a Mountaine you haue made, To o're top old Pelion, or the skyish head Of blew Olympus What is he, whose griefes Beares such an Emphasis? whose phrase of Sorrow Coniure the wandring Starres, and makes them stand Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I, Hamlet the Dane The deuill take thy soule Thou prai'st not well, I prythee take thy fingers from my throat; Sir though I am not Spleenatiue, and rash, Yet haue I something in me dangerous, Which let thy wisenesse feare. Away thy hand Pluck them asunder Hamlet, Hamlet Good my Lord be quiet Why I will fight with him vppon this Theme. Vntill my eielids will no longer wag Oh my Sonne, what Theame? I lou'd Ophelia; fortie thousand Brothers Could not (with all there quantitie of Loue) Make vp my summe. What wilt thou do for her? Oh he is mad Laertes, For loue of God forbeare him Come show me what thou'lt doe. Woo't weepe? Woo't fight? Woo't teare thy selfe? Woo't drinke vp Esile, eate a Crocodile? Ile doo't. Dost thou come heere to whine; To outface me with leaping in her Graue? Be buried quicke with her, and so will I. And if thou prate of Mountaines; let them throw Millions of Akers on vs; till our ground Sindging his pate against the burning Zone, Make Ossa like a wart. Nay, and thou'lt mouth, Ile rant as well as thou This is meere Madnesse: And thus awhile the fit will worke on him: Anon as patient as the female Doue, When that her Golden Cuplet are disclos'd; His silence will sit drooping Heare you Sir: What is the reason that you vse me thus? I lou'd you euer; but it is no matter: Let Hercules himselfe doe what he may, The Cat will Mew, and Dogge will haue his day. I pray you good Horatio wait vpon him, Strengthen your patience in our last nights speech, Wee'l put the matter to the present push: Good Gertrude set some watch ouer your Sonne, This Graue shall haue a liuing Monument: An houre of quiet shortly shall we see; Till then, in patience our proceeding be. So much for this Sir; now let me see the other, You doe remember all the Circumstance Remember it my Lord? Sir, in my heart there was a kinde of fighting, That would not let me sleepe; me thought I lay Worse then the mutines in the Bilboes, rashly, (And praise be rashnesse for it) let vs know, Our indiscretion sometimes serues vs well, When our deare plots do paule, and that should teach vs, There's a Diuinity that shapes our ends, Rough-hew them how we will That is most certaine Vp from my Cabin My sea-gowne scarft about me in the darke, Grop'd I to finde out them; had my desire, Finger'd their Packet, and in fine, withdrew To mine owne roome againe, making so bold, (My feares forgetting manners) to vnseale Their grand Commission, where I found Horatio, Oh royall knauery: An exact command, Larded with many seuerall sorts of reason; Importing Denmarks health, and Englands too, With hoo, such Bugges and Goblins in my life, That on the superuize no leasure bated, No not to stay the grinding of the Axe, My head should be struck off Ist possible? Here's the Commission, read it at more leysure: But wilt thou heare me how I did proceed? I beseech you Being thus benetted round with Villaines, Ere I could make a Prologue to my braines, They had begun the Play. I sate me downe, Deuis'd a new Commission, wrote it faire, I once did hold it as our Statists doe, A basenesse to write faire; and laboured much How to forget that learning: but Sir now, It did me Yeomans seriuce: wilt thou know The effects of what I wrote? I, good my Lord An earnest Coniuration from the King, As England was his faithfull Tributary, As loue betweene them, as the Palme should flourish, As Peace should still her wheaten Garland weare, And stand a Comma 'tweene their amities, And many such like Assis of great charge, That on the view and know of these Contents, Without debatement further, more or lesse, He should the bearers put to sodaine death, Not shriuing time allowed How was this seal'd? Why, euen in that was Heauen ordinate; I had my fathers Signet in my Purse, Which was the Modell of that Danish Seale: Folded the Writ vp in forme of the other, Subscrib'd it, gau't th' impression, plac't it safely, The changeling neuer knowne: Now, the next day Was our Sea Fight, and what to this was sement, Thou know'st already So Guildensterne and Rosincrance, go too't Why man, they did make loue to this imployment They are not neere my Conscience; their debate Doth by their owne insinuation grow: 'Tis dangerous, when the baser nature comes Betweene the passe, and fell incensed points Of mighty opposites Why, what a King is this? Does it not, thinkst thee, stand me now vpon He that hath kil'd my King, and whor'd my Mother, Popt in betweene th' election and my hopes, Throwne out his Angle for my proper life, And with such coozenage; is't not perfect conscience, To quit him with this arme? And is't not to be damn'd To let this Canker of our nature come In further euill It must be shortly knowne to him from England What is the issue of the businesse there It will be short, The interim's mine, and a mans life's no more Then to say one: but I am very sorry good Horatio, That to Laertes I forgot my selfe; For by the image of my Cause, I see The Portraiture of his; Ile count his fauours: But sure the brauery of his griefe did put me Into a Towring passion Peace, who comes heere? Your Lordship is right welcome back to Denmarke I humbly thank you Sir, dost know this waterflie? No my good Lord Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to know him: he hath much Land, and fertile; let a Beast be Lord of Beasts, and his Crib shall stand at the Kings Messe; 'tis a Chowgh; but as I saw spacious in the possession of dirt Sweet Lord, if your friendship were at leysure, I should impart a thing to you from his Maiesty I will receiue it with all diligence of spirit; put your Bonet to his right vse, 'tis for the head I thanke your Lordship, 'tis very hot No, beleeue mee 'tis very cold, the winde is Northerly It is indifferent cold my Lord indeed Mee thinkes it is very soultry, and hot for my Complexion Exceedingly, my Lord, it is very soultry, as 'twere I cannot tell how: but my Lord, his Maiesty bad me signifie to you, that he ha's laid a great wager on your head: Sir, this is the matter I beseech you remember Nay, in good faith, for mine ease in good faith: Sir, you are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is at his weapon What's his weapon? Rapier and dagger That's two of his weapons; but well The sir King ha's wag'd with him six Barbary horses, against the which he impon'd as I take it, sixe French Rapiers and Poniards, with their assignes, as Girdle, Hangers or so: three of the Carriages infaith are very deare to fancy, very responsiue to the hilts, most delicate carriages, and of very liberall conceit What call you the Carriages? The Carriages Sir, are the hangers The phrase would bee more Germaine to the matter: If we could carry Cannon by our sides; I would it might be Hangers till then; but on sixe Barbary Horses against sixe French Swords: their Assignes, and three liberall conceited Carriages, that's the French but against the Danish; why is this impon'd as you call it? The King Sir, hath laid that in a dozen passes betweene you and him, hee shall not exceed you three hits; He hath one twelue for mine, and that would come to imediate tryall, if your Lordship would vouchsafe the Answere How if I answere no? I meane my Lord, the opposition of your person in tryall Sir, I will walke heere in the Hall; if it please his Maiestie, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let the Foyles bee brought, the Gentleman willing, and the King hold his purpose; I will win for him if I can: if not, Ile gaine nothing but my shame, and the odde hits Shall I redeliuer you ee'n so? To this effect Sir, after what flourish your nature will I commend my duty to your Lordship Yours, yours; hee does well to commend it himselfe, there are no tongues else for's tongue This Lapwing runs away with the shell on his head He did Complie with his Dugge before hee suck't it: thus had he and mine more of the same Beauty that I know the drossie age dotes on; only got the tune of the time, and outward habite of encounter, a kinde of yesty collection, which carries them through & through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and doe but blow them to their tryalls: the Bubbles are out You will lose this wager, my Lord I doe not thinke so, since he went into France, I haue beene in continuall practice; I shall winne at the oddes: but thou wouldest not thinke how all heere about my heart: but it is no matter Nay, good my Lord It is but foolery; but it is such a kinde of gain-giuing as would perhaps trouble a woman If your minde dislike any thing, obey. I will forestall their repaire hither, and say you are not fit Not a whit, we defie Augury; there's a speciall Prouidence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now, 'tis not to come: if it bee not to come, it will bee now: if it be not now; yet it will come; the readinesse is all, since no man ha's ought of what he leaues. What is't to leaue betimes? Foyles, and Gauntlets, a Table and Flagons of Wine on it. Come Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me Giue me your pardon Sir, I'ue done you wrong, But pardon't as you are a Gentleman. This presence knowes, And you must needs haue heard how I am punisht With sore distraction? What I haue done That might your nature honour, and exception Roughly awake, I heere proclaime was madnesse: Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Neuer Hamlet. If Hamlet from himselfe be tane away: And when he's not himselfe, do's wrong Laertes, Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it: Who does it then? His Madnesse? If't be so, Hamlet is of the Faction that is wrong'd, His madnesse is poore Hamlets Enemy. Sir, in this Audience, Let my disclaiming from a purpos'd euill, Free me so farre in your most generous thoughts, That I haue shot mine Arrow o're the house, And hurt my Mother I am satisfied in Nature, Whose motiue in this case should stirre me most To my Reuenge. But in my termes of Honor I stand aloofe, and will no reconcilement, Till by some elder Masters of knowne Honor, I haue a voyce, and president of peace To keepe my name vngorg'd. But till that time, I do receiue your offer'd loue like loue, And wil not wrong it I do embrace it freely, And will this Brothers wager frankely play. Giue vs the Foyles: Come on Come one for me Ile be your foile Laertes, in mine ignorance, Your Skill shall like a Starre i'th' darkest night, Sticke fiery off indeede You mocke me Sir No by this hand Giue them the Foyles yong Osricke, Cousen Hamlet, you know the wager Verie well my Lord, Your Grace hath laide the oddes a'th' weaker side I do not feare it, I haue seene you both: But since he is better'd, we haue therefore oddes This is too heauy, Let me see another This likes me well, These Foyles haue all a length. Prepare to play. I my good Lord Set me the Stopes of wine vpon that Table: If Hamlet giue the first, or second hit, Or quit in answer of the third exchange, Let all the Battlements their Ordinance fire, The King shal drinke to Hamlets better breath, And in the Cup an vnion shal he throw Richer then that, which foure successiue Kings In Denmarkes Crowne haue worne. Giue me the Cups, And let the Kettle to the Trumpets speake, The Trumpet to the Cannoneer without, The Cannons to the Heauens, the Heauen to Earth, Now the King drinkes to Hamlet. Come, begin, And you the Iudges beare a wary eye Come on sir Come on sir. They play. One No Iudgement A hit, a very palpable hit Well: againe Stay, giue me drinke. Hamlet, this Pearle is thine, Here's to thy health. Giue him the cup, Trumpets sound, and shot goes off. Ile play this bout first, set by a-while. Come: Another hit; what say you? A touch, a touch, I do confesse Our Sonne shall win He's fat, and scant of breath. Heere's a Napkin, rub thy browes, The Queene Carowses to thy fortune, Hamlet Good Madam Gertrude, do not drinke I will my Lord; I pray you pardon me It is the poyson'd Cup, it is too late I dare not drinke yet Madam, By and by Come, let me wipe thy face My Lord, Ile hit him now I do not thinke't And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience Come for the third. Laertes, you but dally, I pray you passe with your best violence, I am affear'd you make a wanton of me Say you so? Come on. Nothing neither way Haue at you now. In scuffling they change Rapiers. Part them, they are incens'd Nay come, againe Looke to the Queene there hoa They bleed on both sides. How is't my Lord? How is't Laertes? Why as a Woodcocke To mine Sprindge, Osricke, I am iustly kill'd with mine owne Treacherie How does the Queene? She sounds to see them bleede No, no, the drinke, the drinke. Oh my deere Hamlet, the drinke, the drinke, I am poyson'd Oh Villany! How? Let the doore be lock'd. Treacherie, seeke it out It is heere Hamlet. Hamlet, thou art slaine, No Medicine in the world can do thee good. In thee, there is not halfe an houre of life; The Treacherous Instrument is in thy hand, Vnbated and envenom'd: the foule practise Hath turn'd it selfe on me. Loe, heere I lye, Neuer to rise againe: Thy Mothers poyson'd: I can no more, the King, the King's too blame The point envenom'd too, Then venome to thy worke. Hurts the King. Treason, Treason O yet defend me Friends, I am but hurt Heere thou incestuous, murdrous, Damned Dane, Drinke off this Potion: Is thy Vnion heere? Follow my Mother. King Dyes. He is iustly seru'd. It is a poyson temp'red by himselfe: Exchange forgiuenesse with me, Noble Hamlet; Mine and my Fathers death come not vpon thee, Nor thine on me. Heauen make thee free of it, I follow thee. I am dead Horatio, wretched Queene adiew, You that looke pale, and tremble at this chance, That are but Mutes or audience to this acte: Had I but time (as this fell Sergeant death Is strick'd in his Arrest) oh I could tell you. But let it be: Horatio, I am dead, Thou liu'st, report me and my causes right To the vnsatisfied Neuer beleeue it. I am more an Antike Roman then a Dane: Heere's yet some Liquor left As th'art a man, giue me the Cup. Let go, by Heauen Ile haue't. Oh good Horatio, what a wounded name, (Things standing thus vnknowne) shall liue behind me. If thou did'st euer hold me in thy heart, Absent thee from felicitie awhile, And in this harsh world draw thy breath in paine, To tell my Storie. March afarre off, and shout within. What warlike noyse is this? Yong Fortinbras, with conquest come fro Poland To th' Ambassadors of England giues this warlike volly O I dye Horatio: The potent poyson quite ore-crowes my spirit, I cannot liue to heare the Newes from England, But I do prophesie th' election lights On Fortinbras, he ha's my dying voyce, So tell him with the occurrents more and lesse, Which haue solicited. The rest is silence. O, o, o, o. Dyes Now cracke a Noble heart: Goodnight sweet Prince, And flights of Angels sing thee to thy rest, Why do's the Drumme come hither? and Where is this sight? What is it ye would see; If ought of woe, or wonder, cease your search His quarry cries on hauocke. Oh proud death, What feast is toward in thine eternall Cell. That thou so many Princes, at a shoote, So bloodily hast strooke The sight is dismall, And our affaires from England come too late, The eares are senselesse that should giue vs hearing, To tell him his command'ment is fulfill'd, That Rosincrance and Guildensterne are dead: Where should we haue our thankes? Not from his mouth, Had it th' abilitie of life to thanke you: He neuer gaue command'ment for their death. But since so iumpe vpon this bloodie question, You from the Polake warres, and you from England Are heere arriued. Giue order that these bodies High on a stage be placed to the view, And let me speake to th' yet vnknowing world, How these things came about. So shall you heare Of carnall, bloudie, and vnnaturall acts, Of accidentall iudgements, casuall slaughters Of death's put on by cunning, and forc'd cause, And in this vpshot, purposes mistooke, Falne on the Inuentors head. All this can I Truly deliuer Let vs hast to heare it, And call the Noblest to the Audience. For me, with sorrow, I embrace my Fortune, I haue some Rites of memory in this Kingdome, Which are to claime, my vantage doth Inuite me, Of that I shall haue alwayes cause to speake, And from his mouth Whose voyce will draw on more: But let this same be presently perform'd, Euen whiles mens mindes are wilde, Lest more mischance On plots, and errors happen Let foure Captaines Beare Hamlet like a Soldier to the Stage, For he was likely, had he beene put on To haue prou'd most royally: And for his passage, The Souldiours Musicke, and the rites of Warre Speake lowdly for him. Take vp the body; Such a sight as this Becomes the Field, but heere shewes much amis. Go, bid the Souldiers shoote. off. If Musicke be the food of Loue, play on, Giue me excesse of it: that surfetting, The appetite may sicken, and so dye. That straine agen, it had a dying fall: O, it came ore my eare, like the sweet sound That breathes vpon a banke of Violets; Stealing, and giuing Odour. Enough, no more, 'Tis not so sweet now, as it was before. O spirit of Loue, how quicke and fresh art thou, That notwithstanding thy capacitie, Receiueth as the Sea. Nought enters there, Of what validity, and pitch so ere, But falles into abatement, and low price Euen in a minute; so full of shapes is fancie, That it alone, is high fantasticall Will you go hunt my Lord? What Curio? The Hart Why so I do, the Noblest that I haue: O when mine eyes did see Oliuia first, Me thought she purg'd the ayre of pestilence; That instant was I turn'd into a Hart, And my desires like fell and cruell hounds, Ere since pursue me. How now what newes from her? So please my Lord, I might not be admitted, But from her handmaid do returne this answer: The Element it selfe, till seuen yeares heate, Shall not behold her face at ample view: But like a Cloystresse she will vailed walke, And water once a day her Chamber round With eye-offending brine: all this to season A brothers dead loue, which she would keepe fresh And lasting, in her sad remembrance O she that hath a heart of that fine frame To pay this debt of loue but to a brother, How will she loue, when the rich golden shaft Hath kill'd the flocke of all affections else That liue in her. When Liuer, Braine, and Heart, These soueraigne thrones, are all supply'd and fill'd Her sweete perfections with one selfe king: Away before me, to sweet beds of Flowres, Loue-thoughts lye rich, when canopy'd with bowres. Scena Secunda. What Country (Friends) is this? This is Illyria Ladie And what should I do in Illyria? My brother he is in Elizium, Perchance he is not drown'd: What thinke you saylors? It is perchance that you your selfe were saued O my poore brother, and so perchance may he be True Madam, and to comfort you with chance, Assure your selfe, after our ship did split, When you, and those poore number saued with you, Hung on our driuing boate: I saw your brother Most prouident in perill, binde himselfe, (Courage and hope both teaching him the practise) To a strong Maste, that liu'd vpon the sea: Where like Orion on the Dolphines backe, I saw him hold acquaintance with the waues, So long as I could see For saying so, there's Gold: Mine owne escape vnfoldeth to my hope, Whereto thy speech serues for authoritie The like of him. Know'st thou this Countrey? I Madam well, for I was bred and borne Not three houres trauaile from this very place Who gouernes heere? A noble Duke in nature, as in name What is his name? Orsino Orsino: I haue heard my father name him. He was a Batchellor then And so is now, or was so very late: For but a month ago I went from hence, And then 'twas fresh in murmure (as you know What great ones do, the lesse will prattle of,) That he did seeke the loue of faire Oliuia What's shee? A vertuous maid, the daughter of a Count That dide some tweluemonth since, then leauing her In the protection of his sonne, her brother, Who shortly also dide: for whose deere loue (They say) she hath abiur'd the sight And company of men O that I seru'd that Lady, And might not be deliuered to the world Till I had made mine owne occasion mellow What my estate is That were hard to compasse, Because she will admit no kinde of suite, No, not the Dukes There is a faire behauiour in thee Captaine, And though that nature, with a beauteous wall Doth oft close in pollution: yet of thee I will beleeue thou hast a minde that suites With this thy faire and outward charracter. I prethee (and Ile pay thee bounteously) Conceale me what I am, and be my ayde, For such disguise as haply shall become The forme of my intent. Ile serue this Duke, Thou shalt present me as an Eunuch to him, It may be worth thy paines: for I can sing, And speake to him in many sorts of Musicke, That will allow me very worth his seruice. What else may hap, to time I will commit, Onely shape thou thy silence to my wit Be you his Eunuch, and your Mute Ile bee, When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see I thanke thee: Lead me on. Scaena Tertia. Sir To. What a plague meanes my Neece to take the death of her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemie to life By my troth sir Toby, you must come in earlyer a nights: your Cosin, my Lady, takes great exceptions to your ill houres Why let her except, before excepted I, but you must confine your selfe within the modest limits of order Confine? Ile confine my selfe no finer then I am: these cloathes are good enough to drinke in, and so bee these boots too: and they be not, let them hang themselues in their owne straps That quaffing and drinking will vndoe you: I heard my Lady talke of it yesterday: and of a foolish knight that you brought in one night here, to be hir woer Who, Sir Andrew Ague-cheeke? I he He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria What's that to th' purpose? Why he ha's three thousand ducates a yeare I, but hee'l haue but a yeare in all these ducates: He's a very foole, and a prodigall Fie, that you'l say so: he playes o'th Viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages word for word without booke, & hath all the good gifts of nature He hath indeed, almost naturall: for besides that he's a foole, he's a great quarreller: and but that hee hath the gift of a Coward, to allay the gust he hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent, he would quickely haue the gift of a graue By this hand they are scoundrels and substractors that say so of him. Who are they? They that adde moreour, hee's drunke nightly in your company With drinking healths to my Neece: Ile drinke to her as long as there is a passage in my throat, & drinke in Illyria: he's a Coward and a Coystrill that will not drinke to my Neece, till his braines turne o'th toe, like a parish top. What wench? Castiliano vulgo: for here coms Sir Andrew Agueface. Sir Toby Belch. How now sir Toby Belch? Sweet sir Andrew Blesse you faire Shrew And you too sir Accost Sir Andrew, accost What's that? My Neeces Chamber-maid Good Mistris accost, I desire better acquaintance My name is Mary sir Good mistris Mary, accost To, You mistake knight: Accost, is front her, boord her, woe her, assayle her By my troth I would not vndertake her in this company. Is that the meaning of Accost? Far you well Gentlemen And thou let part so Sir Andrew, would thou mightst neuer draw sword agen And you part so mistris, I would I might neuer draw sword agen: Faire Lady, doe you thinke you haue fooles in hand? Sir, I haue not you by'th hand Marry but you shall haue, and heeres my hand Now sir, thought is free: I pray you bring your hand to'th Buttry barre, and let it drinke Wherefore (sweet-heart?) What's your Metaphor? It's dry sir Why I thinke so: I am not such an asse, but I can keepe my hand dry. But what's your iest? A dry iest Sir Are you full of them? I Sir, I haue them at my fingers ends: marry now I let go your hand, I am barren. O knight, thou lack'st a cup of Canarie: when did I see thee so put downe? Neuer in your life I thinke, vnlesse you see Canarie put me downe: mee thinkes sometimes I haue no more wit then a Christian, or an ordinary man ha's: but I am a great eater of beefe, and I beleeue that does harme to my wit No question And I thought that, I'de forsweare it. Ile ride home to morrow sir Toby Pur-quoy my deere knight? What is purquoy? Do, or not do? I would I had bestowed that time in the tongues, that I haue in fencing dancing, and beare-bayting: O had I but followed the Arts Then hadst thou had an excellent head of haire Why, would that haue mended my haire? Past question, for thou seest it will not coole my nature But it becoms me wel enough, dost not? Excellent, it hangs like flax on a distaffe: & I hope to see a huswife take thee between her legs, & spin it off Faith Ile home to morrow sir Toby, your niece wil not be seene, or if she be it's four to one, she'l none of me: the Count himselfe here hard by, wooes her Shee'l none o'th Count, she'l not match aboue hir degree, neither in estate, yeares, nor wit: I haue heard her swear't. Tut there's life in't man Ile stay a moneth longer. I am a fellow o'th strangest minde i'th world: I delight in Maskes and Reuels sometimes altogether Art thou good at these kicke-chawses Knight? As any man in Illyria, whatsoeuer he be, vnder the degree of my betters, & yet I will not compare with an old man What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight? Faith, I can cut a caper And I can cut the Mutton too't And I thinke I haue the backe-tricke, simply as strong as any man in Illyria Wherefore are these things hid? Wherefore haue these gifts a Curtaine before 'em? Are they like to take dust, like mistris Mals picture? Why dost thou not goe to Church in a Galliard, and come home in a Carranto? My verie walke should be a Iigge: I would not so much as make water but in a Sinke-a-pace: What dooest thou meane? Is it a world to hide vertues in? I did thinke by the excellent constitution of thy legge, it was form'd vnder the starre of a Galliard I, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a dam'd colour'd stocke. Shall we sit about some Reuels? What shall we do else: were we not borne vnder Taurus? Taurus? That sides and heart No sir, it is leggs and thighes: let me see thee caper. Ha, higher: ha, ha, excellent. Scena Quarta. If the Duke continue these fauours towards you Cesario, you are like to be much aduanc'd, he hath known you but three dayes, and already you are no stranger You either feare his humour, or my negligence, that you call in question the continuance of his loue. Is he inconstant sir, in his fauours No beleeue me. I thanke you: heere comes the Count Who saw Cesario hoa? On your attendance my Lord heere Stand you a-while aloofe. Cesario, Thou knowst no lesse, but all: I haue vnclasp'd To thee the booke euen of my secret soule. Therefore good youth, addresse thy gate vnto her, Be not deni'de accesse, stand at her doores, And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow Till thou haue audience Sure my Noble Lord, If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow As it is spoke, she neuer will admit me Be clamorous, and leape all ciuill bounds, Rather then make vnprofited returne, Say I do speake with her (my Lord) what then? O then, vnfold the passion of my loue, Surprize her with discourse of my deere faith; It shall become thee well to act my woes: She will attend it better in thy youth, Then in a Nuntio's of more graue aspect I thinke not so, my Lord Deere Lad, beleeue it; For they shall yet belye thy happy yeeres, That say thou art a man: Dianas lip Is not more smooth, and rubious: thy small pipe Is as the maidens organ, shrill, and sound, And all is semblatiue a womans part. I know thy constellation is right apt For this affayre: some foure or fiue attend him, All if you will: for I my selfe am best When least in companie: prosper well in this, And thou shalt liue as freely as thy Lord, To call his fortunes thine Ile do my best To woe your Lady: yet a barrefull strife, Who ere I woe, my selfe would be his wife. Scena Quinta. Nay, either tell me where thou hast bin, or I will not open my lippes so wide as a brissle may enter, in way of thy excuse: my Lady will hang thee for thy absence Let her hang me: hee that is well hang'de in this world, needs to feare no colours Make that good He shall see none to feare A good lenton answer: I can tell thee where y saying was borne, of I feare no colours Where good mistris Mary? In the warrs, & that may you be bolde to say in your foolerie Well, God giue them wisedome that haue it: & those that are fooles, let them vse their talents Yet you will be hang'd for being so long absent, or to be turn'd away: is not that as good as a hanging to you? Many a good hanging, preuents a bad marriage: and for turning away, let summer beare it out You are resolute then? Not so neyther, but I am resolu'd on two points That if one breake, the other will hold: or if both breake, your gaskins fall Apt in good faith, very apt: well go thy way, if sir Toby would leaue drinking, thou wert as witty a piece of Eues flesh, as any in Illyria Peace you rogue, no more o'that: here comes my Lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best. Wit, and't be thy will, put me into good fooling: those wits that thinke they haue thee, doe very oft proue fooles: and I that am sure I lacke thee, may passe for a wise man. For what saies Quinapalus, Better a witty foole, then a foolish wit. God blesse thee Lady Take the foole away Do you not heare fellowes, take away the Ladie Go too, y'are a dry foole: Ile no more of you: besides you grow dis-honest Two faults Madona, that drinke & good counsell wil amend: for giue the dry foole drink, then is the foole not dry: bid the dishonest man mend himself, if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if hee cannot, let the Botcher mend him: any thing that's mended, is but patch'd: vertu that transgresses, is but patcht with sinne, and sin that amends, is but patcht with vertue. If that this simple Sillogisme will serue, so: if it will not, what remedy? As there is no true Cuckold but calamity, so beauties a flower; The Lady bad take away the foole, therefore I say againe, take her away Sir, I bad them take away you Misprision in the highest degree. Lady, Cucullus non facit monachum: that's as much to say, as I weare not motley in my braine: good Madona, giue mee leaue to proue you a foole Can you do it? Dexteriously, good Madona Make your proofe I must catechize you for it Madona, Good my Mouse of vertue answer mee Well sir, for want of other idlenesse, Ile bide your proofe Good Madona, why mournst thou? Good foole, for my brothers death I thinke his soule is in hell, Madona I know his soule is in heauen, foole The more foole (Madona) to mourne for your Brothers soule, being in heauen. Take away the Foole, Gentlemen What thinke you of this foole Maluolio, doth he not mend? Yes, and shall do, till the pangs of death shake him: Infirmity that decaies the wise, doth euer make the better foole God send you sir, a speedie Infirmity, for the better increasing your folly: Sir Toby will be sworn that I am no Fox, but he wil not passe his word for two pence that you are no Foole How say you to that Maluolio? I maruell your Ladyship takes delight in such a barren rascall: I saw him put down the other day, with an ordinary foole, that has no more braine then a stone. Looke you now, he's out of his gard already: vnles you laugh and minister occasion to him, he is gag'd. I protest I take these Wisemen, that crow so at these set kinde of fooles, no better then the fooles Zanies O you are sicke of selfe-loue Maluolio, and taste with a distemper'd appetite. To be generous, guiltlesse, and of free disposition, is to take those things for Bird-bolts, that you deeme Cannon bullets: There is no slander in an allow'd foole, though he do nothing but rayle; nor no rayling, in a knowne discreet man, though hee do nothing but reproue Now Mercury indue thee with leasing, for thou speak'st well of fooles. Madam, there is at the gate, a young Gentleman, much desires to speake with you From the Count Orsino, is it? Ma I know not (Madam) 'tis a faire young man, and well attended Who of my people hold him in delay? Sir Toby Madam, your kinsman Fetch him off I pray you, he speakes nothing but madman: Fie on him. Go you Maluolio; If it be a suit from the Count, I am sicke, or not at home. What you will, to dismisse it. Now you see sir, how your fooling growes old, & people dislike it Thou hast spoke for vs (Madona) as if thy eldest sonne should be a foole: whose scull, Ioue cramme with braines, for heere he comes. One of thy kin has a most weake Pia-mater By mine honor halfe drunke. What is he at the gate Cosin? A Gentleman A Gentleman? What Gentleman? 'Tis a Gentleman heere. A plague o'these pickle herring: How now Sot Good Sir Toby Cosin, Cosin, how haue you come so earely by this Lethargie? Letcherie, I defie Letchery: there's one at the gate I marry, what is he? Let him be the diuell and he will, I care not: giue me faith say I. Well, it's all one. What's a drunken man like, foole? Like a drown'd man, a foole, and a madde man: One draught aboue heate, makes him a foole, the second maddes him, and a third drownes him Go thou and seeke the Crowner, and let him sitte o'my Coz: for he's in the third degree of drinke: hee's drown'd: go looke after him He is but mad yet Madona, and the foole shall looke to the madman. Madam, yond young fellow sweares hee will speake with you. I told him you were sicke, he takes on him to vnderstand so much, and therefore comes to speak with you. I told him you were asleepe, he seems to haue a fore knowledge of that too, and therefore comes to speake with you. What is to be said to him Ladie, hee's fortified against any deniall Tell him, he shall not speake with me Ha's beene told so: and hee sayes hee'l stand at your doore like a Sheriffes post, and be the supporter to a bench, but hee'l speake with you What kinde o'man is he? Why of mankinde What manner of man? Of verie ill manner: hee'l speake with you, will you, or no Of what personage, and yeeres is he? Not yet old enough for a man, nor yong enough for a boy: as a squash is before tis a pescod, or a Codling when tis almost an Apple: Tis with him in standing water, betweene boy and man. He is verie well-fauour'd, and he speakes verie shrewishly: One would thinke his mothers milke were scarse out of him Let him approach: Call in my Gentlewoman Gentlewoman, my Lady calles. Giue me my vaile: come throw it ore my face, Wee'l once more heare Orsinos Embassie. The honorable Ladie of the house, which is she? Speake to me, I shall answer for her: your will Most radiant, exquisite, and vnmatchable beautie. I pray you tell me if this bee the Lady of the house, for I neuer saw her. I would bee loath to cast away my speech: for besides that it is excellently well pend, I haue taken great paines to con it. Good Beauties, let mee sustaine no scorne; I am very comptible, euen to the least sinister vsage Whence came you sir? I can say little more then I haue studied, & that question's out of my part. Good gentle one, giue mee modest assurance, if you be the Ladie of the house, that | I may proceede in my speech Are you a Comedian? No my profound heart: and yet (by the verie phangs of malice, I sweare) I am not that I play. Are you the Ladie of the house? If I do not vsurpe my selfe, I am Most certaine, if you are she, you do vsurp your selfe: for what is yours to bestowe, is, not yours to reserue. But this is from my Commission: I will on with my speech in your praise, and then shew you the heart of my message Come to what is important in't: I forgiue you the praise Alas, I tooke great paines to studie it, and 'tis Poeticall It is the more like to be feigned, I pray you keep it in. I heard you were sawcy at my gates, & allowd your approach rather to wonder at you, then to heare you. If you be not mad, be gone: if you haue reason, be breefe: 'tis not that time of Moone with me, to make one in so skipping a dialogue Will you hoyst sayle sir, here lies your way No good swabber, I am to hull here a little longer. Some mollification for your Giant, sweete Ladie; tell me your minde, I am a messenger Sure you haue some hiddeous matter to deliuer, when the curtesie of it is so fearefull. Speake your office It alone concernes your eare: I bring no ouerture of warre, no taxation of homage; I hold the Olyffe in my hand: my words are as full of peace, as matter Yet you began rudely. What are you? What would you? The rudenesse that hath appear'd in mee, haue I learn'd from my entertainment. What I am, and what I would, are as secret as maiden-head: to your eares, Diuinity; to any others, prophanation Giue vs the place alone, We will heare this diuinitie. Now sir, what is your text? Most sweet Ladie A comfortable doctrine, and much may bee saide of it. Where lies your Text? In Orsinoes bosome In his bosome? In what chapter of his bosome? To answer by the method, in the first of his hart O, I haue read it: it is heresie. Haue you no more to say? Good Madam, let me see your face Haue you any Commission from your Lord, to negotiate with my face: you are now out of your Text: but we will draw the Curtain, and shew you the picture. Looke you sir, such a one I was this present: Ist not well done? Excellently done, if God did all 'Tis in graine sir, 'twill endure winde and weather Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white, Natures owne sweet, and cunning hand laid on: Lady, you are the cruell'st shee aliue, If you will leade these graces to the graue, And leaue the world no copie O sir, I will not be so hard-hearted: I will giue out diuers scedules of my beautie. It shalbe Inuentoried and euery particle and vtensile labell'd to my will: As, Item two lippes indifferent redde, Item two grey eyes, with lids to them: Item, one necke, one chin, & so forth. Were you sent hither to praise me? I see you what you are, you are too proud: But if you were the diuell, you are faire: My Lord, and master loues you: O such loue Could be but recompenc'd, though you were crown'd The non-pareil of beautie How does he loue me? With adorations, fertill teares, With groanes that thunder loue, with sighes of fire Your Lord does know my mind, I cannot loue him Yet I suppose him vertuous, know him noble, Of great estate, of fresh and stainlesse youth; In voyces well divulg'd, free, learn'd, and valiant, And in dimension, and the shape of nature, A gracious person; But yet I cannot loue him: He might haue tooke his answer long ago If I did loue you in my masters flame, With such a suffring, such a deadly life: In your deniall, I would finde no sence, I would not vnderstand it Why, what would you? Make me a willow Cabine at your gate, And call vpon my soule within the house, Write loyall Cantons of contemned loue, And sing them lowd euen in the dead of night: Hallow your name to the reuerberate hilles, And make the babling Gossip of the aire, Cry out Oliuia: O you should not rest Betweene the elements of ayre, and earth, But you should pittie me You might do much: What is your Parentage? Aboue my fortunes, yet my state is well: I am a Gentleman Get you to your Lord: I cannot loue him: let him send no more, Vnlesse (perchance) you come to me againe, To tell me how he takes it: Fare you well: I thanke you for your paines: spend this for mee I am no feede poast, Lady; keepe your purse, My Master, not my selfe, lackes recompence. Loue make his heart of flint, that you shal loue, And let your feruour like my masters be, Plac'd in contempt: Farwell fayre crueltie. What is your Parentage? Aboue my fortunes, yet my state is well; I am a Gentleman. Ile be sworne thou art, Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbes, actions, and spirit, Do giue thee fiue-fold blazon: not too fast: soft, soft, Vnlesse the Master were the man. How now? Euen so quickly may one catch the plague? Me thinkes I feele this youths perfections With an inuisible, and subtle stealth To creepe in at mine eyes. Well, let it be. What hoa, Maluolio. Heere Madam, at your seruice Run after that same peeuish Messenger The Countes man: he left this Ring behinde him Would I, or not: tell him, Ile none of it. Desire him not to flatter with his Lord, Nor hold him vp with hopes, I am not for him: If that the youth will come this way to morrow, Ile giue him reasons for't: hie thee Maluolio Madam, I will. I do I know not what, and feare to finde Mine eye too great a flatterer for my minde: Fate, shew thy force, our selues we do not owe, What is decreed, must be: and be this so. Will you stay no longer: nor will you not that I go with you By your patience, no: my starres shine darkely ouer me; the malignancie of my fate, might perhaps distemper yours; therefore I shall craue of you your leaue, that I may beare my euils alone. It were a bad recompence for your loue, to lay any of them on you Let me yet know of you, whither you are bound No sooth sir: my determinate voyage is meere extrauagancie. But I perceiue in you so excellent a touch of modestie, that you will not extort from me, what I am willing to keepe in: therefore it charges me in manners, the rather to expresse my selfe: you must know of mee then Antonio, my name is Sebastian (which I call'd Rodorigo) my father was that Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you haue heard of. He left behinde him, my selfe, and a sister, both borne in an houre: if the Heauens had beene pleas'd, would we had so ended. But you sir, alter'd that, for some houre before you tooke me from the breach of the sea, was my sister drown'd Alas the day A Lady sir, though it was said shee much resembled me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but thogh I could not with such estimable wonder ouer-farre beleeue that, yet thus farre I will boldly publish her, shee bore a minde that enuy could not but call faire: Shee is drown'd already sir with salt water, though I seeme to drowne her remembrance againe with more Pardon me sir, your bad entertainment O good Antonio, forgiue me your trouble If you will not murther me for my loue, let mee be your seruant If you will not vndo what you haue done, that is kill him, whom you haue recouer'd, desire it not. Fare ye well at once, my bosome is full of kindnesse, and I am yet so neere the manners of my mother, that vpon the least occasion more, mine eyes will tell tales of me: I am bound to the Count Orsino's Court, farewell. The gentlenesse of all the gods go with thee: I haue many enemies in Orsino's Court, Else would I very shortly see thee there: But come what may, I do adore thee so, That danger shall seeme sport, and I will go. Scaena Secunda. Were not you eu'n now, with the Countesse Oliuia? Euen now sir, on a moderate pace, I haue since ariu'd but hither She returnes this Ring to you (sir) you might haue saued mee my paines, to haue taken it away your selfe. She adds moreouer, that you should put your Lord into a desperate assurance, she will none of him. And one thing more, that you be neuer so hardie to come againe in his affaires, vnlesse it bee to report your Lords taking of this: receiue it so She tooke the Ring of me, Ile none of it Come sir, you peeuishly threw it to her: and her will is, it should be so return'd: If it bee worth stooping for, there it lies, in your eye: if not, bee it his that findes it. I left no Ring with her: what meanes this Lady? Fortune forbid my out-side haue not charm'd her: She made good view of me, indeed so much, That me thought her eyes had lost her tongue, For she did speake in starts distractedly. She loues me sure, the cunning of her passion Inuites me in this churlish messenger: None of my Lords Ring? Why he sent her none; I am the man, if it be so, as tis, Poore Lady, she were better loue a dreame: Disguise, I see thou art a wickednesse, Wherein the pregnant enemie does much. How easie is it, for the proper false In womens waxen hearts to set their formes: Alas, O frailtie is the cause, not wee, For such as we are made, if such we bee: How will this fadge? My master loues her deerely, And I (poore monster) fond asmuch on him: And she (mistaken) seemes to dote on me: What will become of this? As I am man, My state is desperate for my maisters loue: As I am woman (now alas the day) What thriftlesse sighes shall poore Oliuia breath? O time, thou must vntangle this, not I, It is too hard a knot for me t' vnty. Scoena Tertia. Approach Sir Andrew: not to bee a bedde after midnight, is to be vp betimes, and Deliculo surgere, thou know'st Nay by my troth I know not: but I know, to be vp late, is to be vp late A false conclusion: I hate it as an vnfill'd Canne. To be vp after midnight, and to go to bed then is early: so that to go to bed after midnight, is to goe to bed betimes. Does not our liues consist of the foure Elements? Faith so they say, but I thinke it rather consists of eating and drinking Th'art a scholler; let vs therefore eate and drinke Marian I say, a stoope of wine. Heere comes the foole yfaith How now my harts: Did you neuer see the Picture of we three? Welcome asse, now let's haue a catch By my troth the foole has an excellent breast. I had rather then forty shillings I had such a legge, and so sweet a breath to sing, as the foole has. Insooth thou wast in very gracious fooling last night, when thou spok'st of Pigrogromitus, of the Vapians passing the Equinoctial of Queubus: 'twas very good yfaith: I sent thee sixe pence for thy Lemon, hadst it? I did impeticos thy gratillity: for Maluolios nose is no Whip-stocke. My Lady has a white hand, and the Mermidons are no bottle-ale houses Excellent: Why this is the best fooling, when all is done. Now a song Come on, there is sixe pence for you. Let's haue a song There's a testrill of me too: if one knight giue a Would you haue a loue-song, or a song of good life? A loue song, a loue song I, I. I care not for good life Clowne sings . O Mistris mine where are you roming? O stay and heare, your true loues coming, That can sing both high and low. Trip no further prettie sweeting. Iourneys end in louers meeting, Euery wise mans sonne doth know Excellent good, ifaith Good, good What is loue, tis not heereafter, Present mirth, hath present laughter: What's to come, is still vnsure. In delay there lies no plentie, Then come kisse me sweet and twentie: Youths a stuffe will not endure A mellifluous voyce, as I am true knight A contagious breath Very sweet, and contagious ifaith To heare by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion. But shall we make the Welkin dance indeed? Shall wee rowze the night-Owle in a Catch, that will drawe three soules out of one Weauer? Shall we do that? And you loue me, let's doo't: I am dogge at a Catch Byrlady sir, and some dogs will catch well Most certaine: Let our Catch be, Thou Knaue Hold thy peace, thou Knaue knight. I shall be constrain'd in't, to call thee knaue, Knight 'Tis not the first time I haue constrained one to call me knaue. Begin foole: it begins, Hold thy peace I shall neuer begin if I hold my peace Good ifaith: Come begin. Catch sung What a catterwalling doe you keepe heere? If my Ladie haue not call'd vp her Steward Maluolio, and bid him turne you out of doores, neuer trust me My Lady's a Catayan, we are politicians, Maluolios a Peg-a-ramsie, and Three merry men be wee. Am not I consanguinious? Am I not of her blood: tilly vally. Ladie, There dwelt a man in Babylon, Lady, Lady Beshrew me, the knights in admirable fooling I, he do's well enough if he be dispos'd, and so do I too: he does it with a better grace, but I do it more naturall O the twelfe day of December For the loue o' God peace. My masters are you mad? Or what are you? Haue you no wit, manners, nor honestie, but to gabble like Tinkers at this time of night? Do yee make an Alehouse of my Ladies house, that ye squeak out your Coziers Catches without any mitigation or remorse of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor time in you? We did keepe time sir in our Catches. Snecke vp Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My Lady bad me tell you, that though she harbors you as her kinsman, she's nothing ally'd to your disorders. If you can separate your selfe and your misdemeanors, you are welcome to the house: if not, and it would please you to take leaue of her, she is very willing to bid you farewell Farewell deere heart, since I must needs be gone Nay good Sir Toby His eyes do shew his dayes are almost done Is't euen so? But I will neuer dye Sir Toby there you lye This is much credit to you Shall I bid him go What and if you do? Shall I bid him go, and spare not? O no, no, no, no, you dare not Out o' tune sir, ye lye: Art any more then a Steward? Dost thou thinke because thou art vertuous, there shall be no more Cakes and Ale? Yes by S. Anne, and Ginger shall bee hotte y'th mouth too Th'art i'th right. Goe sir, rub your Chaine with crums. A stope of Wine Maria Mistris Mary, if you priz'd my Ladies fauour at any thing more then contempt, you would not giue meanes for this vnciuill rule; she shall know of it by this hand. Go shake your eares 'Twere as good a deede as to drink when a mans a hungrie, to challenge him the field, and then to breake promise with him, and make a foole of him Doo't knight, Ile write thee a Challenge: or Ile deliuer thy indignation to him by word of mouth Sweet Sir Toby be patient for to night: Since the youth of the Counts was to day with my Lady, she is much out of quiet. For Monsieur Maluolio, let me alone with him: If I do not gull him into a nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not thinke I haue witte enough to lye straight in my bed: I know I can do it Possesse vs, possesse vs, tell vs something of him Marrie sir, sometimes he is a kinde of Puritane O, if I thought that, Ide beate him like a dogge What for being a Puritan, thy exquisite reason, deere knight I haue no exquisite reason for't, but I haue reason good enough The diu'll a Puritane that hee is, or any thing constantly but a time-pleaser, an affection'd Asse, that cons State without booke, and vtters it by great swarths. The best perswaded of himselfe: so cram'd (as he thinkes) with excellencies, that it is his grounds of faith, that all that looke on him, loue him: and on that vice in him, will my reuenge finde notable cause to worke What wilt thou do? I will drop in his way some obscure Epistles of loue, wherein by the colour of his beard, the shape of his legge, the manner of his gate, the expressure of his eye, forehead, and complection, he shall finde himselfe most feelingly personated. I can write very like my Ladie your Neece, on a forgotten matter wee can hardly make distinction of our hands Excellent, I smell a deuice I hau't in my nose too He shall thinke by the Letters that thou wilt drop that they come from my Neece, and that shee's in loue with him My purpose is indeed a horse of that colour And your horse now would make him an Asse Asse, I doubt not O twill be admirable Sport royall I warrant you: I know my Physicke will worke with him, I will plant you two, and let the Foole make a third, where he shall finde the Letter: obserue his construction of it: For this night to bed, and dreame on the euent: Farewell. Good night Penthisilea Before me she's a good wench She's a beagle true bred, and one that adores me: what o'that? I was ador'd once too Let's to bed knight: Thou hadst neede send for more money If I cannot recouer your Neece, I am a foule way out Send for money knight, if thou hast her not i'th end, call me Cut If I do not, neuer trust me, take it how you will Come, come, Ile go burne some Sacke, tis too late to go to bed now: Come knight, come knight. Scena Quarta. Giue me some Musick; Now good morow frends. Now good Cesario, but that peece of song, That old and Anticke song we heard last night; Me thought it did releeue my passion much, More then light ayres, and recollected termes Of these most briske and giddy-paced times. Come, but one verse He is not heere (so please your Lordshippe) that should sing it? Who was it? Feste the Iester my Lord, a foole that the Ladie Oliuiaes Father tooke much delight in. He is about the house Seeke him out, and play the tune the while. Musicke playes. Come hither Boy, if euer thou shalt loue In the sweet pangs of it, remember me: For such as I am, all true Louers are, Vnstaid and skittish in all motions else, Saue in the constant image of the creature That is belou'd. How dost thou like this tune? It giues a verie eccho to the seate Where loue is thron'd Thou dost speake masterly, My life vpon't, yong though thou art, thine eye Hath staid vpon some fauour that it loues: Hath it not boy? A little, by your fauour What kinde of woman ist? Of your complection She is not worth thee then. What yeares ifaith? About your yeeres my Lord Too old by heauen: Let still the woman take An elder then her selfe, so weares she to him; So swayes she leuell in her husbands heart: For boy, howeuer we do praise our selues, Our fancies are more giddie and vnfirme, More longing, wauering, sooner lost and worne, Then womens are I thinke it well my Lord Then let thy Loue be yonger then thy selfe, Or thy affection cannot hold the bent: For women are as Roses, whose faire flowre Being once displaid, doth fall that verie howre And so they are: alas, that they are so: To die, euen when they to perfection grow. O fellow come, the song we had last night: Marke it Cesario, it is old and plaine; The Spinsters and the Knitters in the Sun, And the free maides that weaue their thred with bones, Do vse to chaunt it: it is silly sooth, And dallies with the innocence of loue, Like the old age Are you ready Sir? I prethee sing. The Song. Come away, come away death, And in sad cypresse let me be laide. Fye away, fie away breath, I am slaine by a faire cruell maide: My shrowd of white, stuck all with Ew, O prepare it. My part of death no one so true did share it. Not a flower, not a flower sweete On my blacke coffin, let there be strewne: Not a friend, not a friend greet My poore corpes, where my bones shall be throwne: A thousand thousand sighes to saue, lay me o where Sad true louer neuer find my graue, to weepe there There's for thy paines No paines sir, I take pleasure in singing sir Ile pay thy pleasure then Truely sir, and pleasure will be paide one time, or another Giue me now leaue, to leaue thee Now the melancholly God protect thee, and the Tailor make thy doublet of changeable Taffata, for thy minde is a very Opall. I would haue men of such constancie put to Sea, that their businesse might be euery thing, and their intent euerie where, for that's it, that alwayes makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell. Let all the rest giue place: Once more Cesario, Get thee to yond same soueraigne crueltie: Tell her my loue, more noble then the world Prizes not quantitie of dirtie lands, The parts that fortune hath bestow'd vpon her: Tell her I hold as giddily as Fortune: But 'tis that miracle, and Queene of Iems That nature prankes her in, attracts my soule But if she cannot loue you sir It cannot be so answer'd Sooth but you must. Say that some Lady, as perhappes there is, Hath for your loue as great a pang of heart As you haue for Oliuia: you cannot loue her: You tel her so: Must she not then be answer'd? There is no womans sides Can bide the beating of so strong a passion, As loue doth giue my heart: no womans heart So bigge, to hold so much, they lacke retention. Alas, their loue may be call'd appetite, No motion of the Liuer, but the Pallat, That suffer surfet, cloyment, and reuolt, But mine is all as hungry as the Sea, And can digest as much, make no compare Betweene that loue a woman can beare me, And that I owe Oliuia I but I know What dost thou knowe? Too well what loue women to men may owe: In faith they are as true of heart, as we. My Father had a daughter lou'd a man As it might be perhaps, were I a woman I should your Lordship And what's her history? A blanke my Lord: she neuer told her loue, But let concealment like a worme i'th budde Feede on her damaske cheeke: she pin'd in thought, And with a greene and yellow melancholly, She sate like Patience on a Monument, Smiling at greefe. Was not this loue indeede? We men may say more, sweare more, but indeed Our shewes are more then will: for still we proue Much in our vowes, but little in our loue But di'de thy sister of her loue my Boy? I am all the daughters of my Fathers house, And all the brothers too: and yet I know not. Sir, shall I to this Lady? I that's the Theame, To her in haste: giue her this Iewell: say, My loue can giue no place, bide no denay. Scena Quinta. Come thy wayes Signior Fabian Nay Ile come: if I loose a scruple of this sport, let me be boyl'd to death with Melancholly Wouldst thou not be glad to haue the niggardly Rascally sheepe-biter, come by some notable shame? I would exult man: you know he brought me out o' fauour with my Lady, about a Beare-baiting heere To anger him wee'l haue the Beare againe, and we will foole him blacke and blew, shall we not sir Andrew? And we do not, it is pittie of our liues. Heere comes the little villaine: How now my Mettle of India? Get ye all three into the box tree: Maluolio's comming downe this walke, he has beene yonder i'the Sunne practising behauiour to his own shadow this halfe houre: obserue him for the loue of Mockerie: for I know this Letter wil make a contemplatiue Ideot of him. Close in the name of ieasting, lye thou there: for heere comes the Trowt, that must be caught with tickling. 'Tis but Fortune, all is fortune. Maria once told me she did affect me, and I haue heard her self come thus neere, that should shee fancie, it should bee one of my complection. Besides she vses me with a more exalted respect, then any one else that followes her. What should I thinke on't? Heere's an ouer-weening rogue Oh peace: Contemplation makes a rare Turkey Cocke of him, how he iets vnder his aduanc'd plumes Slight I could so beate the Rogue Peace I say To be Count Maluolio Ah Rogue Pistoll him, pistoll him Peace, peace There is example for't: The Lady of the Strachy, married the yeoman of the wardrobe Fie on him Iezabel O peace, now he's deepely in: looke how imagination blowes him Hauing beene three moneths married to her, sitting in my state O for a stone-bow to hit him in the eye Calling my Officers about me, in my branch'd Veluet gowne: hauing come from a day bedde, where I haue left Oliuia sleeping Fire and Brimstone O peace, peace And then to haue the humor of state: and after a demure trauaile of regard: telling them I knowe my place, as I would they should doe theirs: to aske for my kinsman Toby Boltes and shackles Oh peace, peace, peace, now, now Seauen of my people with an obedient start, make out for him: I frowne the while, and perchance winde vp my watch, or play with my some rich Iewell: Toby approaches; curtsies there to me Shall this fellow liue? Though our silence be drawne from vs with cars, yet peace I extend my hand to him thus: quenching my familiar smile with an austere regard of controll And do's not Toby take you a blow o'the lippes, then? Saying, Cosine Toby, my Fortunes hauing cast me on your Neece, giue me this prerogatiue of speech What, what? You must amend your drunkennesse Out scab Nay patience, or we breake the sinewes of our plot? Besides you waste the treasure of your time, with a foolish knight That's mee I warrant you One sir Andrew I knew 'twas I, for many do call mee foole What employment haue we heere? Now is the Woodcocke neere the gin Oh peace, and the spirit of humors intimate reading aloud to him By my life this is my Ladies hand: these bee her very C's, her V's, and her T's, and thus makes shee her great P's. It is in contempt of question her hand Her C's, her V's, and her T's: why that? To the vnknowne belou'd, this, and my good Wishes: Her very Phrases: By your leaue wax. Soft, and the impressure her Lucrece, with which she vses to seale: tis my Lady: To whom should this be? This winnes him, Liuer and all Ioue knowes I loue, but who, Lips do not mooue, no man must know. No man must know. What followes? The numbers alter'd: No man must know, If this should be thee Maluolio? Marrie hang thee brocke I may command where I adore, but silence like a Lucresse knife: With bloodlesse stroke my heart doth gore, M.O.A.I. doth sway my life A fustian riddle Excellent Wench, say I M.O.A.I. doth sway my life. Nay but first let me see, let me see, let me see What dish a poyson has she drest him? And with what wing the stallion checkes at it? I may command, where I adore: Why shee may command me: I serue her, she is my Ladie. Why this is euident to any formall capacitie. There is no obstruction in this, and the end: What should that Alphabeticall position portend, if I could make that resemble something in me? Softly, M.O.A.I O I, make vp that, he is now at a cold sent Sowter will cry vpon't for all this, though it bee as ranke as a Fox M. Maluolio, M. why that begins my name Did not I say he would worke it out, the Curre is excellent at faults M. But then there is no consonancy in the sequell that suffers vnder probation: A. should follow, but O. does And O shall end, I hope I, or Ile cudgell him, and make him cry O And then I. comes behind I, and you had any eye behinde you, you might see more detraction at your heeles, then Fortunes before you M,O,A,I. This simulation is not as the former: and yet to crush this a little, it would bow to mee, for euery one of these Letters are in my name. Soft, here followes prose: If this fall into thy hand, reuolue. In my stars I am aboue thee, but be not affraid of greatnesse: Some are become great, some atcheeues greatnesse, and some haue greatnesse thrust vppon em. Thy fates open theyr hands, let thy blood and spirit embrace them, and to invre thy selfe to what thou art like to be: cast thy humble slough, and appeare fresh. Be opposite with a kinsman, surly with seruants: Let thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thy selfe into the tricke of singularitie. Shee thus aduises thee, that sighes for thee. Remember who commended thy yellow stockings, and wish'd to see thee euer crosse garter'd: I say remember, goe too, thou art made if thou desir'st to be so: If not, let me see thee a steward still, the fellow of seruants, and not woorthie to touch Fortunes fingers Farewell, Shee that would alter seruices with thee, the fortunate vnhappy daylight and champian discouers not more: This is open, I will bee proud, I will reade politicke Authours, I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off grosse acquaintance, I will be point deuise, the very man. I do not now foole my selfe, to let imagination iade mee; for euery reason excites to this, that my Lady loues me. She did commend my yellow stockings of late, shee did praise my legge being crosse-garter'd, and in this she manifests her selfe to my loue, & with a kinde of iniunction driues mee to these habites of her liking. I thanke my starres, I am happy: I will bee strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and crosse Garter'd, euen with the swiftnesse of putting on. Ioue, and my starres be praised. Heere is yet a postscript. Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou entertainst my loue, let it appeare in thy smiling, thy smiles become thee well. Therefore in my presence still smile, deero my sweete, I prethee. Ioue I thanke thee, I will smile, I wil do euery thing that thou wilt haue me. I will not giue my part of this sport for a pension of thousands to be paid from the Sophy I could marry this wench for this deuice So could I too And aske no other dowry with her, but such another iest. Nor I neither Heere comes my noble gull catcher Wilt thou set thy foote o'my necke Or o'mine either? Shall I play my freedome at tray-trip, and becom thy bondslaue? Ifaith, or I either? Why, thou hast put him in such a dreame, that when the image of it leaues him, he must run mad Nay but say true, do's it worke vpon him? Like Aqua vite with a Midwife If you will then see the fruites of the sport, mark his first approach before my Lady: hee will come to her in yellow stockings, and 'tis a colour she abhorres, and crosse garter'd, a fashion shee detests: and hee will smile vpon her, which will now be so vnsuteable to her disposition, being addicted to a melancholly, as shee is, that it cannot but turn him into a notable contempt: if you wil see it follow me To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent diuell of wit Ile make one too. Saue thee Friend and thy Musick: dost thou liue by thy Tabor? No sir, I liue by the Church Art thou a Churchman? No such matter sir, I do liue by the Church: For, I do liue at my house, and my house dooth stand by the Church So thou maist say the Kings lyes by a begger, if a begger dwell neer him: or the Church stands by thy Tabor, if thy Tabor stand by the Church You haue said sir: To see this age: A sentence is but a cheu'rill gloue to a good witte, how quickely the wrong side may be turn'd outward Nay that's certaine: they that dally nicely with words, may quickely make them wanton I would therefore my sister had had no name Sir Why man? Why sir, her names a word, and to dallie with that word, might make my sister wanton: But indeede, words are very Rascals, since bonds disgrac'd them Thy reason man? Troth sir, I can yeeld you none without wordes, and wordes are growne so false, I am loath to proue reason with them I warrant thou art a merry fellow, and car'st for nothing Not so sir, I do care for something: but in my conscience sir, I do not care for you: if that be to care for nothing sir, I would it would make you inuisible Art not thou the Lady Oliuia's foole? No indeed sir, the Lady Oliuia has no folly, shee will keepe no foole sir, till she be married, and fooles are as like husbands, as Pilchers are to Herrings, the Husbands the bigger, I am indeede not her foole, but hir corrupter of words I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's Foolery sir, does walke about the Orbe like the Sun, it shines euery where. I would be sorry sir, but the Foole should be as oft with your Master, as with my Mistris: I thinke I saw your wisedome there Nay, and thou passe vpon me, Ile no more with thee. Hold there's expences for thee Now Ioue in his next commodity of hayre, send thee a beard By my troth Ile tell thee, I am almost sicke for one, though I would not haue it grow on my chinne. Is thy Lady within? Clo Would not a paire of these haue bred sir? Yes being kept together, and put to vse I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia sir, to bring a Cressida to this Troylus I vnderstand you sir, tis well begg'd The matter I hope is not great sir; begging, but a begger: Cressida was a begger. My Lady is within sir. I will conster to them whence you come, who you are, and what you would are out of my welkin, I might say Element, but the word is ouer-worne. This fellow is wise enough to play the foole, And to do that well, craues a kinde of wit: He must obserue their mood on whom he iests, The quality of persons, and the time: And like the Haggard, checke at euery Feather That comes before his eye. This is a practice, As full of labour as a Wise-mans Art: For folly that he wisely shewes, is fit; But wisemens folly falne, quite taint their wit. Saue you Gentleman And you sir Dieu vou guard Monsieur Et vouz ousie vostre seruiture I hope sir, you are, and I am yours Will you incounter the house, my Neece is desirous you should enter, if your trade be to her I am bound to your Neece sir, I meane she is the list of my voyage Taste your legges sir, put them to motion My legges do better vnderstand me sir, then I vnderstand what you meane by bidding me taste my legs I meane to go sir, to enter I will answer you with gate and entrance, but we are preuented. Most excellent accomplish'd Lady, the heauens raine Odours on you That youth's a rare Courtier, raine odours, wel My matter hath no voice Lady, but to your owne most pregnant and vouchsafed eare Odours, pregnant, and vouchsafed: Ile get 'em all three already Let the Garden doore be shut, and leaue mee to my hearing. Giue me your hand sir My dutie Madam, and most humble seruice What is your name? Cesario is your seruants name, faire Princesse My seruant sir? 'Twas neuer merry world, Since lowly feigning was call'd complement: Y'are seruant to the Count Orsino youth And he is yours, and his must needs be yours: Your seruants seruant, is your seruant Madam For him, I thinke not on him: for his thoughts, Would they were blankes, rather then fill'd with me Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts On his behalfe O by your leaue I pray you. I bad you neuer speake againe of him; But would you vndertake another suite I had rather heare you, to solicit that, Then Musicke from the spheares Deere Lady Giue me leaue, beseech you: I did send, After the last enchantment you did heare, A Ring in chace of you. So did I abuse My selfe, my seruant, and I feare me you: Vnder your hard construction must I sit, To force that on you in a shamefull cunning Which you knew none of yours. What might you think? Haue you not set mine Honor at the stake, And baited it with all th' vnmuzled thoughts That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiuing Enough is shewne, a Cipresse, not a bosome, Hides my heart: so let me heare you speake I pittie you That's a degree to loue No not a grize: for tis a vulgar proofe That verie oft we pitty enemies Why then me thinkes 'tis time to smile agen: O world, how apt the poore are to be proud? If one should be a prey, how much the better To fall before the Lion, then the Wolfe? Clocke strikes. The clocke vpbraides me with the waste of time: Be not affraid good youth, I will not haue you, And yet when wit and youth is come to haruest, Your wife is like to reape a proper man: There lies your way, due West Then Westward hoe: Grace and good disposition attend your Ladyship: You'l nothing Madam to my Lord, by me: Stay: I prethee tell me what thou thinkst of me? That you do thinke you are not what you are If I thinke so, I thinke the same of you Then thinke you right: I am not what I am I would you were, as I would haue you be Would it be better Madam, then I am? I wish it might, for now I am your foole O what a deale of scorne, lookes beautifull? In the contempt and anger of his lip, A murdrous guilt shewes not it selfe more soone, Then loue that would seeme hid: Loues night, is noone. Cesario, by the Roses of the Spring, By maid-hood, honor, truth, and euery thing, I loue thee so, that maugre all thy pride, Nor wit, nor reason, can my passion hide: Do not extort thy reasons from this clause, For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause: But rather reason thus, with reason fetter; Loue sought, is good: but giuen vnsought, is better By innocence I sweare, and by my youth, I haue one heart, one bosome, and one truth, And that no woman has, nor neuer none Shall mistris be of it, saue I alone. And so adieu good Madam, neuer more, Will I my Masters teares to you deplore Yet come againe: for thou perhaps mayst moue That heart which now abhorres, to like his loue. Scoena Secunda. No faith, Ile not stay a iot longer: Thy reason deere venom, giue thy reason You must needes yeelde your reason, Sir Andrew? Marry I saw your Neece do more fauours to the Counts Seruing-man, then euer she bestow'd vpon mee: I saw't i'th Orchard Did she see the while, old boy, tell me that As plaine as I see you now This was a great argument of loue in her toward you S'light; will you make an Asse o'me I will proue it legitimate sir, vpon the Oathes of iudgement, and reason And they haue beene grand Iurie men, since before Noah was a Saylor Shee did shew fauour to the youth in your sight, onely to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to put fire in your Heart, and brimstone in your Liuer: you should then haue accosted her, and with some excellent iests, fire-new from the mint, you should haue bangd the youth into dumbenesse: this was look'd for at your hand, and this was baulkt: the double gilt of this opportunitie you let time wash off, and you are now sayld into the North of my Ladies opinion, where you will hang like an ysickle on a Dutchmans beard, vnlesse you do redeeme it, by some laudable attempt, either of valour or policie And't be any way, it must be with Valour, for policie I hate: I had as liefe be a Brownist, as a Politician Why then build me thy fortunes vpon the basis of valour. Challenge me the Counts youth to fight with him hurt him in eleuen places, my Neece shall take note of it, and assure thy selfe, there is no loue-Broker in the world, can more preuaile in mans commendation with woman, then report of valour There is no way but this sir Andrew Will either of you beare me a challenge to him? Go, write it in a martial hand, be curst and briefe: it is no matter how wittie, so it bee eloquent, and full of inuention: taunt him with the license of Inke: if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be amisse, and as many Lyes, as will lye in thy sheete of paper, although the sheete were bigge enough for the bedde of Ware in England, set 'em downe, go about it. Let there bee gaulle enough in thy inke, though thou write with a Goose-pen, no matter: about it Where shall I finde you? Wee'l call thee at the Cubiculo: Go. This is a deere Manakin to you Sir Toby I haue beene deere to him lad, some two thousand strong, or so We shall haue a rare Letter from him; but you'le not deliuer't Neuer trust me then: and by all meanes stirre on the youth to an answer. I thinke Oxen and waine-ropes cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were open'd and you finde so much blood in his Liuer, as will clog the foote of a flea, Ile eate the rest of th' anatomy And his opposit the youth beares in his visage no great presage of cruelty. Looke where the youngest Wren of mine comes If you desire the spleene, and will laughe your selues into stitches, follow me; yond gull Maluolio is turned Heathen, a verie Renegatho; for there is no christian that meanes to be saued by beleeuing rightly, can euer beleeue such impossible passages of grossenesse. Hee's in yellow stockings And crosse garter'd? Most villanously: like a Pedant that keepes a Schoole i'th Church: I haue dogg'd him like his murtherer. He does obey euery point of the Letter that I dropt, to betray him: He does smile his face into more lynes, then is in the new Mappe, with the augmentation of the Indies: you haue not seene such a thing as tis: I can hardly forbeare hurling things at him, I know my Ladie will strike him: if shee doe, hee'l smile, and take't for a great fauour Come bring vs, bring vs where he is. Scaena Tertia. I would not by my will haue troubled you, But since you make your pleasure of your paines, I will no further chide you I could not stay behinde you: my desire (More sharpe then filed steele) did spurre me forth, And not all loue to see you (though so much As might haue drawne one to a longer voyage) But iealousie, what might befall your trauell, Being skillesse in these parts: which to a stranger, Vnguided, and vnfriended, often proue Rough, and vnhospitable. My willing loue, The rather by these arguments of feare Set forth in your pursuite My kinde Anthonio, I can no other answer make, but thankes, And thankes: and euer oft good turnes, Are shuffel'd off with such vncurrant pay: But were my worth, as is my conscience firme, You should finde better dealing: what's to do? Shall we go see the reliques of this Towne? To morrow sir, best first go see your Lodging? I am not weary, and 'tis long to night I pray you let vs satisfie our eyes With the memorials, and the things of fame That do renowne this City Would youl'd pardon me: I do not without danger walke these streetes. Once in a sea-fight 'gainst the Count his gallies, I did some seruice, of such note indeede, That were I tane heere, it would scarse be answer'd Belike you slew great number of his people Th' offence is not of such a bloody nature, Albeit the quality of the time, and quarrell Might well haue giuen vs bloody argument: It might haue since bene answer'd in repaying What we tooke from them, which for Traffiques sake Most of our City did. Onely my selfe stood out, For which if I be lapsed in this place I shall pay deere Do not then walke too open It doth not fit me: hold sir, here's my purse, In the South Suburbes at the Elephant Is best to lodge: I will bespeake our dyet, Whiles you beguile the time, and feed your knowledge With viewing of the Towne, there shall you haue me Why I your purse? Haply your eye shall light vpon some toy You haue desire to purchase: and your store I thinke is not for idle Markets, sir Ile be your purse-bearer, and leaue you For an houre To th' Elephant I do remember. Scoena Quarta. I haue sent after him, he sayes hee'l come: How shall I feast him? What bestow of him? For youth is bought more oft, then begg'd, or borrow'd. I speake too loud: Where's Maluolio, he is sad, and ciuill, And suites well for a seruant with my fortunes, Where is Maluolio? He's comming Madame: But in very strange manner. He is sure possest Madam Why what's the matter, does he raue? No Madam, he does nothing but smile: your Ladyship were best to haue some guard about you, if hee come, for sure the man is tainted in's wits Go call him hither. I am as madde as hee, If sad and merry madnesse equall bee. How now Maluolio? Sweet Lady, ho, ho Smil'st thou? I sent for thee vpon a sad occasion Sad Lady, I could be sad: This does make some obstruction in the blood: This crosse-gartering, but what of that? If it please the eye of one, it is with me as the very true Sonnet is: Please one, and please all Why how doest thou man? What is the matter with thee? Not blacke in my minde, though yellow in my legges: It did come to his hands, and Commaunds shall be executed. I thinke we doe know the sweet Romane hand Wilt thou go to bed Maluolio? To bed? I sweet heart, and Ile come to thee God comfort thee: Why dost thou smile so, and kisse thy hand so oft? How do you Maluolio? At your request: Yes Nightingales answere Dawes Why appeare you with this ridiculous boldnesse before my Lady Be not afraid of greatnesse: 'twas well writ What meanst thou by that Maluolio? Some are borne great Ha? Some atcheeue greatnesse What sayst thou? And some haue greatnesse thrust vpon them Heauen restore thee Remember who commended thy yellow stockings Thy yellow stockings? And wish'd to see thee crosse garter'd Crosse garter'd? Go too, thou art made, if thou desir'st to be so Am I made? If not, let me see thee a seruant still Why this is verie Midsommer madnesse. Madame, the young Gentleman of the Count Orsino's is return'd, I could hardly entreate him backe: he attends your Ladyships pleasure Ile come to him. Good Maria, let this fellow be look'd too. Where's my Cosine Toby, let some of my people haue a speciall care of him, I would not haue him miscarrie for the halfe of my Dowry. Oh ho, do you come neere me now: no worse man then sir Toby to looke to me. This concurres directly with the Letter, she sends him on purpose, that I may appeare stubborne to him: for she incites me to that in the Letter. Cast thy humble slough sayes she: be opposite with a Kinsman, surly with seruants, let thy tongue langer with arguments of state, put thy selfe into the tricke of singularity: and consequently setts downe the manner how: as a sad face, a reuerend carriage, a slow tongue, in the habite of some Sir of note, and so foorth. I haue lymde her, but it is Ioues doing, and Ioue make me thankefull. And when she went away now, let this Fellow be look'd too: Fellow? not Maluolio, nor after my degree, but Fellow. Why euery thing adheres togither, that no dramme of a scruple, no scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous or vnsafe circumstance: What can be saide? Nothing that can be, can come betweene me, and the full prospect of my hopes. Well Ioue, not I, is the doer of this, and he is to be thanked. Which way is hee in the name of sanctity. If all the diuels of hell be drawne in little, and Legion himselfe possest him, yet Ile speake to him Heere he is, heere he is: how ist with you sir? How ist with you man? Go off, I discard you: let me enioy my priuate: go off Lo, how hollow the fiend speakes within him; did not I tell you? Sir Toby, my Lady prayes you to haue a care of him Ah ha, does she so? Go too, go too: peace, peace, wee must deale gently with him: Let me alone. How do you Maluolio? How ist with you? What man, defie the diuell: consider, he's an enemy to mankinde Do you know what you say? La you, and you speake ill of the diuell, how he takes it at heart. Pray God he be not bewitch'd Carry his water to th' wise woman Marry and it shall be done to morrow morning if I liue. My Lady would not loose him for more then ile say How now mistris? Oh Lord Prethee hold thy peace, this is not the way: Doe you not see you moue him? Let me alone with him No way but gentlenesse, gently, gently: the Fiend is rough, and will not be roughly vs'd Why how now my bawcock? how dost y chuck? Sir I biddy, come with me. What man, tis not for grauity to play at cherrie-pit with sathan Hang him foul Colliar Get him to say his prayers, good sir Toby gette him to pray My prayers Minx No I warrant you, he will not heare of godlynesse Go hang your selues all: you are ydle shallowe things, I am not of your element, you shall knowe more heereafter. Ist possible? If this were plaid vpon a stage now, I could condemne it as an improbable fiction His very genius hath taken the infection of the deuice man Nay pursue him now, least the deuice take ayre, and taint Why we shall make him mad indeede The house will be the quieter Come, wee'l haue him in a darke room & bound. My Neece is already in the beleefe that he's mad: we may carry it thus for our pleasure, and his pennance, til our very pastime tyred out of breath, prompt vs to haue mercy on him: at which time, we wil bring the deuice to the bar and crowne thee for a finder of madmen: but see, but see. More matter for a May morning Heere's the Challenge, reade it: I warrant there's vinegar and pepper in't Ist so sawcy? I, ist? I warrant him: do but read Giue me. Youth, whatsoeuer thou art, thou art but a scuruy fellow Good, and valiant Wonder not, nor admire not in thy minde why I doe call thee so, for I will shew thee no reason for't A good note, that keepes you from the blow of y Law Thou comst to the Lady Oliuia, and in my sight she vses thee kindly: but thou lyest in thy throat, that is not the matter I challenge thee for Very breefe, and to exceeding good sence-lesse I will way-lay thee going home, where if it be thy chance to kill me Good Thou kilst me like a rogue and a villaine Still you keepe o'th windie side of the Law: good Fartheewell, and God haue mercie vpon one of our soules. He may haue mercie vpon mine, but my hope is better, and so looke to thy selfe. Thy friend as thou vsest him, & thy sworne enemie, Andrew Ague-cheeke If this Letter moue him not, his legges cannot: Ile giu't him You may haue verie fit occasion for't: he is now in some commerce with my Ladie, and will by and by depart Go sir Andrew: scout mee for him at the corner of the Orchard like a bum-Baylie: so soone as euer thou seest him, draw, and as thou draw'st, sweare horrible: for it comes to passe oft, that a terrible oath, with a swaggering accent sharpely twang'd off, giues manhoode more approbation, then euer proofe it selfe would haue earn'd him. Away Nay let me alone for swearing. Now will not I deliuer his Letter: for the behauiour of the yong Gentleman, giues him out to be of good capacity, and breeding: his employment betweene his Lord and my Neece, confirmes no lesse. Therefore, this Letter being so excellently ignorant, will breed no terror in the youth: he will finde it comes from a Clodde-pole. But sir, I will deliuer his Challenge by word of mouth; set vpon Ague-cheeke a notable report of valor, and driue the Gentleman (as I know his youth will aptly receiue it) into a most hideous opinion of his rage, skill, furie, and impetuositie. This will so fright them both, that they wil kill one another by the looke, like Cockatrices. Heere he comes with your Neece, giue them way till he take leaue, and presently after him I wil meditate the while vpon some horrid message for a Challenge I haue said too much vnto a hart of stone, And laid mine honour too vnchary on't: There's something in me that reproues my fault: But such a head-strong potent fault it is, That it but mockes reproofe With the same hauiour that your passion beares, Goes on my Masters greefes Heere, weare this Iewell for me, tis my picture: Refuse it not, it hath no tongue, to vex you: And I beseech you come againe to morrow. What shall you aske of me that Ile deny, That honour (sau'd) may vpon asking giue Nothing but this, your true loue for my master How with mine honor may I giue him that, Which I haue giuen to you I will acquit you Well, come againe to morrow: far-thee-well, A Fiend like thee might beare my soule to hell. Gentleman, God saue thee And you sir That defence thou hast, betake the too't: of what nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I knowe not: but thy intercepter full of despight, bloody as the Hunter, attends thee at the Orchard end: dismount thy tucke, be yare in thy preparation, for thy assaylant is quick, skilfull, and deadly You mistake sir I am sure, no man hath any quarrell to me: my remembrance is very free and cleere from any image of offence done to any man You'l finde it otherwise I assure you: therefore, if you hold your life at any price, betake you to your gard: for your opposite hath in him what youth, strength, skill, and wrath, can furnish man withall I pray you sir what is he? He is knight dubb'd with vnhatch'd Rapier, and on carpet consideration, but he is a diuell in priuate brall, soules and bodies hath he diuorc'd three, and his incensement at this moment is so implacable, that satisfaction can be none, but by pangs of death and sepulcher: Hob, nob, is his word: giu't or take't I will returne againe into the house, and desire some conduct of the Lady. I am no fighter, I haue heard of some kinde of men, that put quarrells purposely on others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man of that quirke Sir, no: his indignation deriues it selfe out of a very computent iniurie, therefore get you on, and giue him his desire. Backe you shall not to the house, vnlesse you vndertake that with me, which with as much safetie you might answer him: therefore on, or strippe your sword starke naked: for meddle you must that's certain, or forsweare to weare iron about you This is as vnciuill as strange. I beseech you doe me this courteous office, as to know of the Knight what my offence to him is: it is something of my negligence, nothing of my purpose I will doe so. Signiour Fabian, stay you by this Gentleman, till my returne. Pray you sir, do you know of this matter? I know the knight is incenst against you, euen to a mortall arbitrement, but nothing of the circumstance more I beseech you what manner of man is he? Nothing of that wonderfull promise to read him by his forme, as you are like to finde him in the proofe of his valour. He is indeede sir, the most skilfull, bloudy, & fatall opposite that you could possibly haue found in anie part of Illyria: will you walke towards him, I will make your peace with him, if I can I shall bee much bound to you for't: I am one, that had rather go with sir Priest, then sir knight: I care not who knowes so much of my mettle. Why man hee s a verie diuell, I haue not seen such a firago: I had a passe with him, rapier, scabberd, and all: and he giues me the stucke in with such a mortall motion that it is ineuitable: and on the answer, he payes you as surely, as your feete hits the ground they step on. They say, he has bin Fencer to the Sophy Pox on't, Ile not meddle with him I but he will not now be pacified, Fabian can scarse hold him yonder Plague on't, and I thought he had beene valiant, and so cunning in Fence, I'de haue seene him damn'd ere I'de haue challeng'd him. Let him let the matter slip, and Ile giue him my horse, gray Capilet Ile make the motion: stand heere, make a good shew on't, this shall end without the perdition of soules, marry Ile ride your horse as well as I ride you. I haue his horse to take vp the quarrell, I haue perswaded him the youths a diuell He is as horribly conceited of him: and pants, & lookes pale, as if a Beare were at his heeles There's no remedie sir, he will fight with you for's oath sake: marrie hee hath better bethought him of his quarrell, and hee findes that now scarse to bee worth talking of: therefore draw for the supportance of his vowe, he protests he will not hurt you Pray God defend me: a little thing would make me tell them how much I lacke of a man Giue ground if you see him furious Come sir Andrew, there's no remedie, the Gentleman will for his honors sake haue one bowt with you: he cannot by the Duello auoide it: but hee has promised me, as he is a Gentleman and a Soldiour, he will not hurt you. Come on, too't Pray God he keepe his oath. I do assure you tis against my will Put vp your sword: if this yong Gentleman Haue done offence, I take the fault on me: If you offend him, I for him defie you You sir? Why, what are you? One sir, that for his loue dares yet do more Then you haue heard him brag to you he will Nay, if you be an vndertaker, I am for you. O good sir Toby hold: heere come the Officers Ile be with you anon Pray sir, put your sword vp if you please Marry will I sir: and for that I promis'd you Ile be as good as my word. Hee will beare you easily, and raines well 1.Off. This is the man, do thy Office 2.Off. Anthonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino You do mistake me sir 1.Off. No sir, no iot: I know your fauour well: Though now you haue no sea-cap on your head: Take him away, he knowes I know him well I must obey. This comes with seeking you: But there's no remedie, I shall answer it: What will you do: now my necessitie Makes me to aske you for my purse. It greeues mee Much more, for what I cannot do for you, Then what befals my selfe: you stand amaz'd, But be of comfort 2.Off. Come sir away I must entreat of you some of that money What money sir? For the fayre kindnesse you haue shew'd me heere, And part being prompted by your present trouble, Out of my leane and low ability Ile lend you something: my hauing is not much, Ile make diuision of my present with you: Hold, there's halfe my Coffer Will you deny me now, Ist possible that my deserts to you Can lacke perswasion. Do not tempt my misery, Least that it make me so vnsound a man As to vpbraid you with those kindnesses That I haue done for you I know of none, Nor know I you by voyce, or any feature: I hate ingratitude more in a man, Then lying, vainnesse, babling drunkennesse, Or any taint of vice, whose strong corruption Inhabites our fraile blood Oh heauens themselues 2.Off. Come sir, I pray you go Let me speake a little. This youth that you see heere, I snatch'd one halfe out of the iawes of death, Releeu'd him with such sanctitie of loue; And to his image, which me thought did promise Most venerable worth, did I deuotion 1.Off. What's that to vs, the time goes by: Away But oh, how vilde an idoll proues this God: Thou hast Sebastian done good feature, shame. In Nature, there's no blemish but the minde: None can be call'd deform'd, but the vnkinde. Vertue is beauty, but the beauteous euill Are empty trunkes, ore-flourish'd by the deuill 1.Off. The man growes mad, away with him: Come, come sir Leade me on. Me thinkes his words do from such passion flye That he beleeues himselfe, so do not I: Proue true imagination, oh proue true, That I deere brother, be now tane for you Come hither Knight, come hither Fabian: Weel whisper ore a couplet or two of most sage sawes He nam'd Sebastian: I my brother know Yet liuing in my glasse: euen such, and so In fauour was my Brother, and he went Still in this fashion, colour, ornament, For him I imitate: Oh if it proue, Tempests are kinde, and salt waues fresh in loue A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward then a Hare, his dishonesty appeares, in leauing his frend heere in necessity, and denying him: and for his cowardship aske Fabian A Coward, a most deuout Coward, religious in it Slid Ile after him againe, and beate him Do, cuffe him soundly, but neuer draw thy sword And I do not Come, let's see the euent I dare lay any money, twill be nothing yet. Will you make me beleeue, that I am not sent for you? Go too, go too, thou art a foolish fellow, Let me be cleere of thee Well held out yfaith: No, I do not know you, nor I am not sent to you by my Lady, to bid you come speake with her: nor your name is not Master Cesario, nor this is not my nose neyther: Nothing that is so, is so I prethee vent thy folly some-where else, thou know'st not me Vent my folly: He has heard that word of some great man, and now applyes it to a foole. Vent my folly: I am affraid this great lubber the World will proue a Cockney: I prethee now vngird thy strangenes, and tell me what I shall vent to my Lady? Shall I vent to hir that thou art comming? I prethee foolish greeke depart from me, there's money for thee, if you tarry longer, I shall giue worse paiment By my troth thou hast an open hand: these Wisemen that giue fooles money, get themselues a good report, after foureteene yeares purchase. Now sir, haue I met you again: ther's for you Why there's for thee, and there, and there, Are all the people mad? Hold sir, or Ile throw your dagger ore the house This will I tell my Lady straight, I would not be in some of your coats for two pence Come on sir, hold Nay let him alone, Ile go another way to worke with him: Ile haue an action of Battery against him, if there be any law in Illyria: though I stroke him first, yet it's no matter for that Let go thy hand Come sir, I will not let you go. Come my yong souldier put vp your yron: you are well flesh'd: Come on I will be free from thee. What wouldst y now? If thou dar'st tempt me further, draw thy sword What, what? Nay then I must haue an Ounce or two of this malapert blood from you. Hold Toby, on thy life I charge thee hold Madam Will it be euer thus? Vngracious wretch, Fit for the Mountaines, and the barbarous Caues, Where manners nere were preach'd: out of my sight. Be not offended, deere Cesario: Rudesbey be gone. I prethee gentle friend, Let thy fayre wisedome, not thy passion sway In this vnciuill, and vniust extent Against thy peace. Go with me to my house, And heare thou there how many fruitlesse prankes This Ruffian hath botch'd vp, that thou thereby Mayst smile at this: Thou shalt not choose but goe: Do not denie, beshrew his soule for mee, He started one poore heart of mine, in thee What rellish is in this? How runs the streame? Or I am mad, or else this is a dreame: Let fancie still my sense in Lethe steepe, If it be thus to dreame, still let me sleepe Nay come I prethee, would thoud'st be rul'd by me Madam, I will O say so, and so be. Scoena Secunda. Nay, I prethee put on this gown, & this beard, make him beleeue thou art sir Topas the Curate, doe it quickly. Ile call sir Toby the whilst Well, Ile put it on, and I will dissemble my selfe in't, and I would I were the first that euer dissembled in in such a gowne. I am not tall enough to become the function well, nor leane enough to bee thought a good Studient: but to be said an honest man and a good houskeeper goes as fairely, as to say, a carefull man, & a great scholler. The Competitors enter. Ioue blesse thee M. Parson Bonos dies sir Toby: for as the old hermit of Prage that neuer saw pen and inke, very wittily sayd to a Neece of King Gorbodacke, that that is, is: so I being M. Parson, am M.

As hell sir Topas Why it hath bay Windowes transparant as baricadoes, and the cleere stores toward the South north, are as lustrous as Ebony: and yet complainest thou of obstruction? I am not mad sir Topas, I say to you this house is darke Madman thou errest: I say there is no darknesse but ignorance, in which thou art more puzel'd then the aegyptians in their fogge I say this house is as darke as Ignorance, thogh Ignorance were as darke as hell; and I say there was neuer man thus abus'd, I am no more madde then you are, make the triall of it in any constant question What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning Wilde-fowle? That the soule of our grandam, might happily inhabite a bird What thinkst thou of his opinion? I thinke nobly of the soule, and no way aproue his opinion Fare thee well: remaine thou still in darkenesse, thou shalt hold th' opinion of Pythagoras, ere I will allow of thy wits, and feare to kill a Woodcocke, lest thou dispossesse the soule of thy grandam. Fare thee well Sir Topas, sir Topas My most exquisite sir Topas Nay I am for all waters Thou mightst haue done this without thy berd and gowne, he sees thee not To him in thine owne voyce, and bring me word how thou findst him: I would we were well ridde of this knauery. If he may bee conueniently deliuer'd, I would he were, for I am now so farre in offence with my Niece, that I cannot pursue with any safety this sport the vppeshot. Come by and by to my Chamber.

But tel me true, are you not mad indeed, or do you but counterfeit Beleeue me I am not, I tell thee true Nay, Ile nere beleeue a madman till I see his brains I will fetch you light, and paper, and inke Foole, Ile requite it in the highest degree: I prethee be gone I am gone sir, and anon sir, Ile be with you againe: In a trice, like to the old vice, your neede to sustaine. Who with dagger of lath, in his rage and his wrath, cries ah ha, to the diuell: Like a mad lad, paire thy nayles dad, Adieu good man diuell. Scaena Tertia. This is the ayre, that is the glorious Sunne, This pearle she gaue me, I do feel't, and see't, And though tis wonder that enwraps me thus, Yet 'tis not madnesse. Where's Anthonio then, I could not finde him at the Elephant, Yet there he was, and there I found this credite, That he did range the towne to seeke me out, His councell now might do me golden seruice, For though my soule disputes well with my sence, That this may be some error, but no madnesse, Yet doth this accident and flood of Fortune, So farre exceed all instance, all discourse, That I am readie to distrust mine eyes, And wrangle with my reason that perswades me To any other trust, but that I am mad, Or else the Ladies mad; yet if 'twere so, She could not sway her house, command her followers, Take, and giue backe affayres, and their dispatch, With such a smooth, discreet, and stable bearing As I perceiue she do's: there's something in't That is deceiueable. But heere the Lady comes. Blame not this haste of mine: if you meane well Now go with me, and with this holy man Into the Chantry by: there before him, And vnderneath that consecrated roofe, Plight me the full assurance of your faith, That my most iealious, and too doubtfull soule May liue at peace. He shall conceale it, Whiles you are willing it shall come to note, What time we will our celebration keepe According to my birth, what do you say? Ile follow this good man, and go with you, And hauing sworne truth, euer will be true Then lead the way good father, & heauens so shine, That they may fairely note this acte of mine. Now as thou lou'st me, let me see his Letter Good M. Fabian, grant me another request Any thing Do not desire to see this Letter This is to giue a dogge, and in recompence desire my dogge againe. Belong you to the Lady Oliuia, friends? I sir, we are some of her trappings I know thee well: how doest thou my good Fellow? Truely sir, the better for my foes, and the worse for my friends Iust the contrary: the better for thy friends No sir, the worse How can that be? Marry sir, they praise me, and make an asse of me, now my foes tell me plainly, I am an Asse: so that by my foes sir, I profit in the knowledge of my selfe, and by my friends I am abused: so that conclusions to be as kisses, if your foure negatiues make your two affirmatiues, why then the worse for my friends, and the better for my foes Why this is excellent By my troth sir, no: though it please you to be one of my friends Thou shalt not be the worse for me, there's gold But that it would be double dealing sir, I would you could make it another O you giue me ill counsell Put your grace in your pocket sir, for this once, and let your flesh and blood obey it Well, I will be so much a sinner to be a double dealer: there's another Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play, and the olde saying is, the third payes for all: the triplex sir, is a good tripping measure, or the belles of S. Bennet sir, may put you in minde, one, two, three You can foole no more money out of mee at this throw: if you will let your Lady know I am here to speak with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake my bounty further Marry sir, lullaby to your bountie till I come agen. I go sir, but I would not haue you to thinke, that my desire of hauing is the sinne of couetousnesse: but as you say sir, let your bounty take a nappe, I will awake it anon. Here comes the man sir, that did rescue mee That face of his I do remember well, Yet when I saw it last, it was besmear'd As blacke as Vulcan, in the smoake of warre: A bawbling Vessell was he Captaine of, For shallow draught and bulke vnprizable, With which such scathfull grapple did he make, With the most noble bottome of our Fleete, That very enuy, and the tongue of losse Cride fame and honor on him: What's the matter? 1.Offi. Orsino, this is that Anthonio That tooke the Phoenix, and her fraught from Candy, And this is he that did the Tiger boord, When your yong Nephew Titus lost his legge; Heere in the streets, desperate of shame and state, In priuate brabble did we apprehend him He did me kindnesse sir, drew on my side, But in conclusion put strange speech vpon me, I know not what 'twas, but distraction Notable Pyrate, thou salt-water Theefe, What foolish boldnesse brought thee to their mercies, Whom thou in termes so bloudie, and so deere Hast made thine enemies? Orsino: Noble sir, Be pleas'd that I shake off these names you giue mee: Anthonio neuer yet was Theefe, or Pyrate, Though I confesse, on base and ground enough Orsino's enemie. A witchcraft drew me hither: That most ingratefull boy there by your side, From the rude seas enrag'd and foamy mouth Did I redeeme: a wracke past hope he was: His life I gaue him, and did thereto adde My loue without retention, or restraint, All his in dedication. For his sake, Did I expose my selfe (pure for his loue) Into the danger of this aduerse Towne, Drew to defend him, when he was beset: Where being apprehended, his false cunning (Not meaning to partake with me in danger) Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance, And grew a twentie yeeres remoued thing While one would winke: denide me mine owne purse, Which I had recommended to his vse, Not halfe an houre before How can this be? When came he to this Towne? To day my Lord: and for three months before, No intrim, not a minutes vacancie, Both day and night did we keepe companie. Heere comes the Countesse, now heauen walkes on earth: But for thee fellow, fellow thy words are madnesse, Three monthes this youth hath tended vpon mee, But more of that anon. Take him aside What would my Lord, but that he may not haue, Wherein Oliuia may seeme seruiceable? Cesario, you do not keepe promise with me Madam: Gracious Oliuia What do you say Cesario? Good my Lord My Lord would speake, my dutie hushes me If it be ought to the old tune my Lord, It is as fat and fulsome to mine eare As howling after Musicke Still so cruell? Still so constant Lord What to peruersenesse? you vnciuill Ladie To whose ingrate, and vnauspicious Altars My soule the faithfull'st offrings haue breath'd out That ere deuotion tender'd. What shall I do? Euen what it please my Lord, that shal becom him Why should I not, (had I the heart to do it) Like to th' Egyptian theefe, at point of death Kill what I loue: (a sauage iealousie, That sometime sauours nobly) but heare me this: Since you to non-regardance cast my faith, And that I partly know the instrument That screwes me from my true place in your fauour: Liue you the Marble-brested Tirant still. But this your Minion, whom I know you loue, And whom, by heauen I sweare, I tender deerely, Him will I teare out of that cruell eye, Where he sits crowned in his masters spite. Come boy with me, my thoughts are ripe in mischiefe: Ile sacrifice the Lambe that I do loue, To spight a Rauens heart within a Doue And I most iocund, apt, and willinglie, To do you rest, a thousand deaths would dye Where goes Cesario? After him I loue, More then I loue these eyes, more then my life, More by all mores, then ere I shall loue wife. If I do feigne, you witnesses aboue Punish my life, for tainting of my loue Aye me detested, how am I beguil'd? Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong? Hast thou forgot thy selfe? Is it so long? Call forth the holy Father Come, away Whether my Lord? Cesario, Husband, stay Husband? I Husband. Can he that deny? Her husband, sirrah? No my Lord, not I Alas, it is the basenesse of thy feare, That makes thee strangle thy propriety: Feare not Cesario, take thy fortunes vp, Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art As great as that thou fear'st. O welcome Father: Father, I charge thee by thy reuerence Heere to vnfold, though lately we intended To keepe in darkenesse, what occasion now Reueales before 'tis ripe: what thou dost know Hath newly past, betweene this youth, and me A Contract of eternall bond of loue, Confirm'd by mutuall ioynder of your hands, Attested by the holy close of lippes, Strengthned by enterchangement of your rings, And all the Ceremonie of this compact Seal'd in my function, by my testimony: Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my graue I haue trauail'd but two houres O thou dissembling Cub: what wilt thou be When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case? Or will not else thy craft so quickely grow, That thine owne trip shall be thine ouerthrow: Farewell, and take her, but direct thy feete, Where thou, and I (henceforth) may neuer meet My Lord, I do protest O do not sweare, Hold little faith, though thou hast too much feare. For the loue of God a Surgeon, send one presently to sir Toby What's the matter? H'as broke my head acrosse, and has giuen Sir Toby a bloody Coxcombe too: for the loue of God your helpe, I had rather then forty pound I were at home Who has done this sir Andrew? The Counts Gentleman, one Cesario: we tooke him for a Coward, but hee's the verie diuell, incardinate My Gentleman Cesario? Odd's lifelings heere he is: you broke my head for nothing, and that that I did, I was set on to do't by sir Toby Why do you speake to me, I neuer hurt you: You drew your sword vpon me without cause, But I bespake you faire, and hurt you not. If a bloody coxcombe be a hurt, you haue hurt me: I thinke you set nothing by a bloody Coxecombe. Heere comes sir Toby halting, you shall heare more: but if he had not beene in drinke, hee would haue tickel'd you other gates then he did How now Gentleman? how ist with you? That's all one, has hurt me, and there's th' end on't: Sot, didst see Dicke Surgeon, sot? O he's drunke sir Toby an houre agone: his eyes were set at eight i'th morning Then he's a Rogue, and a passy measures pauyn: I hate a drunken rogue Away with him? Who hath made this hauocke with them? Ile helpe you sir Toby, because we'll be drest together Will you helpe an Asse-head, and a coxcombe, & a knaue: a thin fac'd knaue, a gull? Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd too. I am sorry Madam I haue hurt your kinsman: But had it beene the brother of my blood, I must haue done no lesse with wit and safety. You throw a strange regard vpon me, and by that I do perceiue it hath offended you: Pardon me (sweet one) euen for the vowes We made each other, but so late ago One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons, A naturall Perspectiue, that is, and is not Anthonio: O my deere Anthonio, How haue the houres rack'd, and tortur'd me, Since I haue lost thee? Sebastian are you? Fear'st thou that Anthonio? How haue you made diuision of your selfe, An apple cleft in two, is not more twin Then these two creatures. Which is Sebastian? Most wonderfull Do I stand there? I neuer had a brother: Nor can there be that Deity in my nature Of heere, and euery where. I had a sister, Whom the blinde waues and surges haue deuour'd: Of charity, what kinne are you to me? What Countreyman? What name? What Parentage? Of Messaline: Sebastian was my Father, Such a Sebastian was my brother too: So went he suited to his watery tombe: If spirits can assume both forme and suite, You come to fright vs A spirit I am indeed, But am in that dimension grossely clad, Which from the wombe I did participate. Were you a woman, as the rest goes euen, I should my teares let fall vpon your cheeke, And say, thrice welcome drowned Viola My father had a moale vpon his brow And so had mine And dide that day when Viola from her birth Had numbred thirteene yeares O that record is liuely in my soule, He finished indeed his mortall acte That day that made my sister thirteene yeares If nothing lets to make vs happie both, But this my masculine vsurp'd attyre: Do not embrace me, till each circumstance, Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and iumpe That I am Viola, which to confirme, Ile bring you to a Captaine in this Towne, Where lye my maiden weeds: by whose gentle helpe, I was preseru'd to serue this Noble Count: All the occurrence of my fortune since Hath beene betweene this Lady, and this Lord So comes it Lady, you haue beene mistooke: But Nature to her bias drew in that. You would haue bin contracted to a Maid, Nor are you therein (by my life) deceiu'd, You are betroth'd both to a maid and man Be not amaz'd, right noble is his blood: If this be so, as yet the glasse seemes true, I shall haue share in this most happy wracke, Boy, thou hast saide to me a thousand times, Thou neuer should'st loue woman like to me And all those sayings, will I ouer sweare, And all those swearings keepe as true in soule, As doth that Orbed Continent, the fire, That seuers day from night Giue me thy hand, And let me see thee in thy womans weedes The Captaine that did bring me first on shore Hath my Maides garments: he vpon some Action Is now in durance, at Maluolio's suite, a Gentleman, and follower of my Ladies He shall inlarge him: fetch Maluolio hither, And yet alas, now I remember me, They say poore Gentleman, he's much distract. A most extracting frensie of mine owne From my remembrance, clearly banisht his. How does he sirrah? Truely Madam, he holds Belzebub at the staues end as well as a man in his case may do: has heere writ a letter to you, I should haue giuen't you to day morning. But as a madmans Epistles are no Gospels, so it skilles not much when they are deliuer'd Open't, and read it Looke then to be well edified, when the Foole deliuers the Madman. By the Lord Madam How now, art thou mad? No Madam, I do but reade madnesse: and your Ladyship will haue it as it ought to bee, you must allow Vox Prethee reade i'thy right wits So I do Madona: but to reade his right wits, is to reade thus: therefore, perpend my Princesse, and giue eare Read it you, sirrah Reads. By the Lord Madam, you wrong me, and the world shall know it: Though you haue put mee into darkenesse, and giuen your drunken Cosine rule ouer me, yet haue I the benefit of my senses as well as your Ladieship. I haue your owne letter, that induced mee to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt not, but to do my selfe much right, or you much shame: thinke of me as you please. I leaue my duty a little vnthought of, and speake out of my iniury. The madly vs'd Maluolio Did he write this? I Madame This sauours not much of distraction See him deliuer'd Fabian, bring him hither: My Lord, so please you, these things further thought on, To thinke me as well a sister, as a wife, One day shall crowne th' alliance on't, so please you, Heere at my house, and at my proper cost Madam, I am most apt t' embrace your offer: Your Master quits you: and for your seruice done him, So much against the mettle of your sex, So farre beneath your soft and tender breeding, And since you call'd me Master, for so long: Heere is my hand, you shall from this time bee Your Masters Mistris A sister, you are she. Is this the Madman? I my Lord, this same: How now Maluolio? Madam, you haue done me wrong, Notorious wrong Haue I Maluolio? No Lady you haue, pray you peruse that Letter. You must not now denie it is your hand, Write from it if you can, in hand, or phrase, Or say, tis not your seale, not your inuention: You can say none of this. Well, grant it then, And tell me in the modestie of honor, Why you haue giuen me such cleare lights of fauour, Bad me come smiling, and crosse-garter'd to you, To put on yellow stockings, and to frowne Vpon sir Toby, and the lighter people: And acting this in an obedient hope, Why haue you suffer'd me to be imprison'd, Kept in a darke house, visited by the Priest, And made the most notorious gecke and gull, That ere inuention plaid on? Tell me why? Alas Maluolio, this is not my writing, Though I confesse much like the Charracter: But out of question, tis Marias hand. And now I do bethinke me, it was shee First told me thou wast mad; then cam'st in smiling, And in such formes, which heere were presuppos'd Vpon thee in the Letter: prethee be content, This practice hath most shrewdly past vpon thee: But when we know the grounds, and authors of it, Thou shalt be both the Plaintiffe and the Iudge Of thine owne cause Good Madam heare me speake, And let no quarrell, nor no braule to come, Taint the condition of this present houre, Which I haue wondred at. In hope it shall not, Most freely I confesse my selfe, and Toby Set this deuice against Maluolio heere, Vpon some stubborne and vncourteous parts We had conceiu'd against him. Maria writ The Letter, at sir Tobyes great importance, In recompence whereof, he hath married her: How with a sportfull malice it was follow'd, May rather plucke on laughter then reuenge, If that the iniuries be iustly weigh'd, That haue on both sides past Alas poore Foole, how haue they baffel'd thee? Why some are borne great, some atchieue greatnesse, and some haue greatnesse throwne vpon them. I was one sir, in this Enterlude, one sir Topas sir, but that's all one: By the Lord Foole, I am not mad: but do you remember, Madam, why laugh you at such a barren rascall, and you smile not he's gag'd: and thus the whirlegigge of time, brings in his reuenges Ile be reueng'd on the whole packe of you? He hath bene most notoriously abus'd Pursue him, and entreate him to a peace: He hath not told vs of the Captaine yet, When that is knowne, and golden time conuents A solemne Combination shall be made Of our deere soules. Meane time sweet sister, We will not part from hence. Cesario come (For so you shall be while you are a man:) But when in other habites you are seene, Orsino's Mistris, and his fancies Queene. Clowne sings . When that I was and a little tine boy, with hey, ho, the winde and the raine: A foolish thing was but a toy, for the raine it raineth euery day. But when I came to mans estate, with hey ho, &c. Gainst Knaues and Theeues men shut their gate, for the raine, &c. But when I came alas to wiue, with hey ho, &c. By swaggering could I neuer thriue, for the raine, &c. But when I came vnto my beds, with hey ho, &c. With tospottes still had drunken heades, for the raine, &c. A great while ago the world begon, hey ho, &c. But that's all one, our Play is done, and wee'l striue to please you euery day. Escalus My Lord Of Gouernment, the properties to vnfold, Would seeme in me t' affect speech & discourse, Since I am put to know, that your owne Science Exceedes (in that) the lists of all aduice My strength can giue you: Then no more remaines But that, to your sufficiency, as your worth is able, And let them worke: The nature of our People, Our Cities Institutions, and the Termes For Common Iustice, y'are as pregnant in As Art, and practise, hath inriched any That we remember: There is our Commission, From which, we would not haue you warpe; call hither, I say, bid come before vs Angelo: What figure of vs thinke you, he will beare. For you must know, we haue with speciall soule Elected him our absence to supply; Lent him our terror, drest him with our loue, And giuen his Deputation all the Organs Of our owne powre: What thinke you of it? If any in Vienna be of worth To vndergoe such ample grace, and honour, It is Lord Angelo. Looke where he comes Alwayes obedient to your Graces will, I come to know your pleasure Angelo: There is a kinde of Character in thy life, That to th' obseruer, doth thy history Fully vnfold: Thy selfe, and thy belongings Are not thine owne so proper, as to waste Thy selfe vpon thy vertues; they on thee: Heauen doth with vs, as we, with Torches doe, Not light them for themselues: For if our vertues Did not goe forth of vs, 'twere all alike As if we had them not: Spirits are not finely touch'd, But to fine issues: nor nature neuer lends The smallest scruple of her excellence, But like a thrifty goddesse, she determines Her selfe the glory of a creditour, Both thanks, and vse; but I do bend my speech To one that can my part in him aduertise; Hold therefore Angelo: In our remoue, be thou at full, our selfe: Mortallitie and Mercie in Vienna Liue in thy tongue, and heart: Old Escalus Though first in question, is thy secondary. Take thy Commission Now good my Lord Let there be some more test, made of my mettle, Before so noble, and so great a figure Be stamp't vpon it No more euasion: We haue with a leauen'd, and prepared choice Proceeded to you; therefore take your honors: Our haste from hence is of so quicke condition, That it prefers it selfe, and leaues vnquestion'd Matters of needfull value: We shall write to you As time, and our concernings shall importune, How it goes with vs, and doe looke to know What doth befall you here. So fare you well: To th' hopefull execution doe I leaue you, Of your Commissions Yet giue leaue (my Lord,) That we may bring you something on the way My haste may not admit it, Nor neede you (on mine honor) haue to doe With any scruple: your scope is as mine owne, So to inforce, or qualifie the Lawes As to your soule seemes good: Giue me your hand, Ile priuily away: I loue the people, But doe not like to stage me to their eyes: Though it doe well, I doe not rellish well Their lowd applause, and Aues vehement: Nor doe I thinke the man of safe discretion That do's affect it. Once more fare you well The heauens giue safety to your purposes Lead forth, and bring you backe in happinesse. I thanke you, fare you well I shall desire you, Sir, to giue me leaue To haue free speech with you; and it concernes me To looke into the bottome of my place: A powre I haue, but of what strength and nature, I am not yet instructed 'Tis so with me: Let vs withdraw together, And we may soone our satisfaction haue Touching that point Ile wait vpon your honor. Scena Secunda. If the Duke, with the other Dukes, come not to composition with the King of Hungary, why then all the Dukes fall vpon the King 1.Gent. Heauen grant vs its peace, but not the King of Hungaries 2.Gent. Amen Thou conclud'st like the Sanctimonious Pirat, that went to sea with the ten Commandements, but scrap'd one out of the Table 2.Gent. Thou shalt not Steale? I, that he raz'd 1.Gent. Why? 'twas a commandement, to command the Captaine and all the rest from their functions: they put forth to steale: There's not a Souldier of vs all, that in the thanks-giuing before meate, do rallish the petition well, that praies for peace 2.Gent. I neuer heard any Souldier dislike it I beleeue thee: for I thinke thou neuer was't where Grace was said 2.Gent. No? a dozen times at least 1.Gent. What? In meeter? In any proportion: or in any language 1.Gent. I thinke, or in any Religion I, why not? Grace, is Grace, despight of all controuersie: as for example; Thou thy selfe art a wicked villaine, despight of all Grace 1.Gent. Well: there went but a paire of sheeres betweene vs I grant: as there may betweene the Lists, and the Veluet. Thou art the List 1.Gent. And thou the Veluet; thou art good veluet; thou'rt a three pild-peece I warrant thee: I had as liefe be a Lyst of an English Kersey, as be pil'd, as thou art pil'd, for a French Veluet. Do I speake feelingly now? I thinke thou do'st: and indeed with most painfull feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine owne confession, learne to begin thy health; but, whilst I liue forget to drinke after thee 1.Gen. I think I haue done my selfe wrong, haue I not? 2.Gent. Yes, that thou hast; whether thou art tainted, or free. Behold, behold, where Madam Mitigation comes. I haue purchas'd as many diseases vnder her Roofe, As come to 2.Gent. To what, I pray? Iudge 2.Gent. To three thousand Dollours a yeare 1.Gent. I, and more A French crowne more 1.Gent. Thou art alwayes figuring diseases in me; but thou art full of error, I am sound Nay, not (as one would say) healthy: but so sound, as things that are hollow; thy bones are hollow; Impiety has made a feast of thee 1.Gent. How now, which of your hips has the most profound Ciatica? Well, well: there's one yonder arrested, and carried to prison, was worth fiue thousand of you all 2.Gent. Who's that I pray'thee? Marry Sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio 1.Gent. Claudio to prison? 'tis not so Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested: saw him carried away: and which is more, within these three daies his head to be chop'd off But, after all this fooling, I would not haue it so: Art thou sure of this? I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam Iulietta with childe Beleeue me this may be: he promis'd to meete me two howres since, and he was euer precise in promise keeping 2.Gent. Besides you know, it drawes somthing neere to the speech we had to such a purpose 1.Gent. But most of all agreeing with the proclamatio Away: let's goe learne the truth of it. Thus, what with the war; what with the sweat, what with the gallowes, and what with pouerty, I am Custom-shrunke. How now? what's the newes with you. Yonder man is carried to prison Well: what has he done? A Woman But what's his offence? Groping for Trowts, in a peculiar Riuer What? is there a maid with child by him? No: but there's a woman with maid by him: you haue not heard of the proclamation, haue you? What proclamation, man? All howses in the Suburbs of Vienna must bee pluck'd downe And what shall become of those in the Citie? They shall stand for seed: they had gon down to, but that a wise Burger put in for them But shall all our houses of resort in the Suburbs be puld downe? To the ground, Mistris Why heere's a change indeed in the Commonwealth: what shall become of me? Come: feare not you; good Counsellors lacke no Clients: though you change your place, you neede not change your Trade: Ile bee your Tapster still; courage, there will bee pitty taken on you; you that haue worne your eyes almost out in the seruice, you will bee considered What's to doe heere, Thomas Tapster? let's withdraw? Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the Prouost to prison: and there's Madam Iuliet. Scena Tertia. Fellow, why do'st thou show me thus to th' world? Beare me to prison, where I am committed I do it not in euill disposition, But from Lord Angelo by speciall charge Thus can the demy-god (Authority) Make vs pay downe, for our offence, by waight The words of heauen; on whom it will, it will, On whom it will not (soe) yet still 'tis iust Why how now Claudio? whence comes this restraint From too much liberty, (my Lucio) Liberty As surfet is the father of much fast, So euery Scope by the immoderate vse Turnes to restraint: Our Natures doe pursue Like Rats that rauyn downe their proper Bane, A thirsty euill, and when we drinke, we die If I could speake so wisely vnder an arrest, I would send for certaine of my Creditors: and yet, to say the truth, I had as lief haue the foppery of freedome, as the mortality of imprisonment: what's thy offence, Claudio? What (but to speake of) would offend againe What, is't murder? No Lecherie? Call it so Away, Sir, you must goe One word, good friend: Lucio, a word with you A hundred: If they'll doe you any good: Is Lechery so look'd after? Thus stands it with me: vpon a true contract I got possession of Iulietas bed, You know the Lady, she is fast my wife, Saue that we doe the denunciation lacke Of outward Order. This we came not to, Onely for propogation of a Dowre Remaining in the Coffer of her friends, From whom we thought it meet to hide our Loue Till Time had made them for vs. But it chances The stealth of our most mutuall entertainment With Character too grosse, is writ on Iuliet With childe, perhaps? Vnhappely, euen so. And the new Deputie, now for the Duke, Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newnes, Or whether that the body publique, be A horse whereon the Gouernor doth ride, Who newly in the Seate, that it may know He can command; lets it strait feele the spur: Whether the Tirranny be in his place, Or in his Eminence that fills it vp I stagger in: But this new Gouernor Awakes me all the inrolled penalties Which haue (like vn-scowr'd Armor) hung by th' wall So long, that ninteene Zodiacks haue gone round, And none of them beene worne; and for a name Now puts the drowsie and neglected Act Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name I warrant it is: And thy head stands so tickle on thy shoulders, that a milke-maid, if she be in loue, may sigh it off: Send after the Duke, and appeale to him I haue done so, but hee's not to be found. I pre'thee (Lucio) doe me this kinde seruice: This day, my sister should the Cloyster enter, And there receiue her approbation. Acquaint her with the danger of my state, Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends To the strict deputie: bid her selfe assay him, I haue great hope in that: for in her youth There is a prone and speechlesse dialect, Such as moue men: beside, she hath prosperous Art When she will play with reason, and discourse, And well she can perswade I pray shee may; aswell for the encouragement of the like, which else would stand vnder greeuous imposition: as for the enioying of thy life, who I would be sorry should bee thus foolishly lost, at a game of ticketacke: Ile to her I thanke you good friend Lucio Within two houres Come Officer, away.

No: holy Father, throw away that thought, Beleeue not that the dribling dart of Loue Can pierce a compleat bosome: why, I desire thee To giue me secret harbour, hath a purpose More graue, and wrinkled, then the aimes, and ends Of burning youth May your Grace speake of it? My holy Sir, none better knowes then you How I haue euer lou'd the life remoued And held in idle price, to haunt assemblies Where youth, and cost, witlesse brauery keepes. I haue deliuerd to Lord Angelo (A man of stricture and firme abstinence) My absolute power, and place here in Vienna, And he supposes me trauaild to Poland, (For so I haue strewd it in the common eare) And so it is receiu'd: Now (pious Sir) You will demand of me, why I do this Gladly, my Lord We haue strict Statutes, and most biting Laws, (The needfull bits and curbes to headstrong weedes,) Which for this foureteene yeares, we haue let slip, Euen like an ore-growne Lyon in a Caue That goes not out to prey: Now, as fond Fathers, Hauing bound vp the threatning twigs of birch, Onely to sticke it in their childrens sight, For terror, not to vse: in time the rod More mock'd, then fear'd: so our Decrees, Dead to infliction, to themselues are dead, And libertie, plucks Iustice by the nose; The Baby beates the Nurse, and quite athwart Goes all decorum It rested in your Grace To vnloose this tyde-vp Iustice, when you pleas'd: And it in you more dreadfull would haue seem'd Then in Lord Angelo I doe feare: too dreadfull: Sith 'twas my fault, to giue the people scope, 'Twould be my tirrany to strike and gall them, For what I bid them doe: For, we bid this be done When euill deedes haue their permissiue passe, And not the punishment: therefore indeede (my father) I haue on Angelo impos'd the office, Who may in th' ambush of my name, strike home, And yet, my nature neuer in the sight To do in slander: And to behold his sway I will, as 'twere a brother of your Order, Visit both Prince, and People: Therefore I pre'thee Supply me with the habit, and instruct me How I may formally in person beare Like a true Frier: Moe reasons for this action At our more leysure, shall I render you; Onely, this one: Lord Angelo is precise, Stands at a guard with Enuie: scarce confesses That his blood flowes: or that his appetite Is more to bread then stone: hence shall we see If power change purpose: what our Seemers be.

Hoa? peace be in this place Who's that which cals? It is a mans voice: gentle Isabella Turne you the key, and know his businesse of him; You may; I may not: you are yet vnsworne: When you haue vowd, you must not speake with men, But in the presence of the Prioresse; Then if you speake, you must not show your face; Or if you show your face, you must not speake. He cals againe: I pray you answere him Peace and prosperitie: who is't that cals? Haile Virgin, (if you be) as those cheeke-Roses Proclaime you are no lesse: can you so steed me, As bring me to the sight of Isabella, A Nouice of this place, and the faire Sister To her vnhappie brother Claudio? Why her vnhappy Brother? Let me aske, The rather for I now must make you know I am that Isabella, and his Sister Gentle & faire: your Brother kindly greets you; Not to be weary with you; he's in prison Woe me; for what? For that, which if my selfe might be his Iudge, He should receiue his punishment, in thankes: He hath got his friend with childe Sir, make me not your storie 'Tis true; I would not, though 'tis my familiar sin, With Maids to seeme the Lapwing, and to iest Tongue, far from heart: play with all Virgins so: I hold you as a thing en-skied, and sainted, By your renouncement, an imortall spirit And to be talk'd with in sincerity, As with a Saint You doe blaspheme the good, in mocking me Doe not beleeue it: fewnes, and truth; tis thus, Your brother, and his louer haue embrac'd; As those that feed, grow full: as blossoming Time That from the seednes, the bare fallow brings To teeming foyson: euen so her plenteous wombe Expresseth his full Tilth, and husbandry Some one with childe by him? my cosen Iuliet? Is she your cosen? Adoptedly, as schoole-maids change their names By vaine, though apt affection She it is Oh, let him marry her This is the point. The Duke is very strangely gone from hence; Bore many gentlemen (my selfe being one) In hand, and hope of action: but we doe learne, By those that know the very Nerues of State, His giuing-out, were of an infinite distance From his true meant designe: vpon his place, (And with full line of his authority) Gouernes Lord Angelo; A man, whose blood Is very snow-broth: one, who neuer feeles The wanton stings, and motions of the sence; But doth rebate, and blunt his naturall edge With profits of the minde: Studie, and fast He (to giue feare to vse, and libertie, Which haue, for long, run-by the hideous law, As Myce, by Lyons) hath pickt out an act, Vnder whose heauy sence, your brothers life Fals into forfeit: he arrests him on it, And followes close the rigor of the Statute To make him an example: all hope is gone, Vnlesse you haue the grace, by your faire praier To soften Angelo: And that's my pith of businesse 'Twixt you, and your poore brother Doth he so, Seeke his life? Has censur'd him already, And as I heare, the Prouost hath a warrant For's execution Alas: what poore Abilitie's in me, to doe him good Assay the powre you haue My power? alas, I doubt Our doubts are traitors And makes vs loose the good we oft might win, By fearing to attempt: Goe to Lord Angelo And let him learne to know, when Maidens sue Men giue like gods: but when they weepe and kneele, All their petitions, are as freely theirs As they themselues would owe them Ile see what I can doe But speedily I will about it strait; No longer staying, but to giue the Mother Notice of my affaire: I humbly thanke you: Commend me to my brother: soone at night Ile send him certaine word of my successe I take my leaue of you Good sir, adieu. We must not make a scar-crow of the Law, Setting it vp to feare the Birds of prey, And let it keepe one shape, till custome make it Their pearch, and not their terror I, but yet Let vs be keene, and rather cut a little Then fall, and bruise to death: alas, this gentleman Whom I would saue, had a most noble father, Let but your honour know (Whom I beleeue to be most strait in vertue) That in the working of your owne affections, Had time coheard with Place, or place with wishing, Or that the resolute acting of our blood Could haue attaind th' effect of your owne purpose, Whether you had not sometime in your life Er'd in this point, which now you censure him, And puld the Law vpon you 'Tis one thing to be tempted (Escalus) Another thing to fall: I not deny The Iury passing on the Prisoners life May in the sworne-twelue haue a thiefe, or two Guiltier then him they try; what's open made to Iustice, That Iustice ceizes; What knowes the Lawes That theeues do passe on theeues? 'Tis very pregnant, The Iewell that we finde, we stoope, and take't, Because we see it; but what we doe not see, We tread vpon, and neuer thinke of it. You may not so extenuate his offence, For I haue had such faults; but rather tell me When I, that censure him, do so offend, Let mine owne Iudgement patterne out my death, And nothing come in partiall. Sir, he must dye. Be it as your wisedome will Where is the Prouost? Here if it like your honour See that Claudio Be executed by nine to morrow morning, Bring him his Confessor, let him be prepar'd, For that's the vtmost of his pilgrimage Well: heauen forgiue him; and forgiue vs all: Some rise by sinne, and some by vertue fall: Some run from brakes of Ice, and answere none, And some condemned for a fault alone. Come, bring them away: if these be good people in a Common-weale, that doe nothing but vse their abuses in common houses, I know no law: bring them away How now Sir, what's your name? And what's the matter? If it please your honour, I am the poore Dukes Constable, and my name is Elbow; I doe leane vpon Iustice Sir, and doe bring in here before your good honor, two notorious Benefactors Benefactors? Well: What Benefactors are they? Are they not Malefactors?

Elbow is your name? Why do'st thou not speake Elbow? He cannot Sir: he's out at Elbow What are you Sir?

My wife Sir? whom I detest before heauen, and your honour How? thy wife? I Sir: whom I thanke heauen is an honest woman Do'st thou detest her therefore? I say sir, I will detest my selfe also, as well as she, that this house, if it be not a Bauds house, it is pitty of her life, for it is a naughty house How do'st thou know that, Constable? Marry sir, by my wife, who, if she had bin a woman Cardinally giuen, might haue bin accus'd in fornication, adultery, and all vncleanlinesse there By the womans meanes? I sir, by Mistris Ouerdons meanes: but as she spit in his face, so she defide him Sir, if it please your honor, this is not so Proue it before these varlets here, thou honorable man, proue it Doe you heare how he misplaces? Sir, she came in great with childe: and longing (sauing your honors reuerence) for stewd prewyns; sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very distant time stood, as it were in a fruit dish (a dish of some three pence; your honours haue seene such dishes) they are not China-dishes, but very good dishes Go too: go too: no matter for the dish sir No indeede sir not of a pin; you are therein in the right: but, to the point: As I say, this Mistris Elbow, being (as I say) with childe, and being great bellied, and longing (as I said) for prewyns: and hauing but two in the dish (as I said) Master Froth here, this very man, hauing eaten the rest (as I said) & (as I say) paying for them very honestly: for, as you know Master Froth, I could not giue you three pence againe No indeede Very well: you being then (if you be remembred) cracking the stones of the foresaid prewyns I, so I did indeede Why, very well: I telling you then (if you be remembred) that such a one, and such a one, were past cure of the thing you wot of, vnlesse they kept very good diet, as I told you All this is true Why very well then Come: you are a tedious foole: to the purpose: what was done to Elbowes wife, that hee hath cause to complaine of? Come me to what was done to her Sir, your honor cannot come to that yet No sir, nor I meane it not Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honours leaue: And I beseech you, looke into Master Froth here sir, a man of foure-score pound a yeare; whose father died at Hallowmas: Was't not at Hallowmas Master Froth? Allhallond-Eue Why very well: I hope here be truthes: he Sir, sitting (as I say) in a lower chaire, Sir, 'twas in the bunch of Grapes, where indeede you haue a delight to sit, haue you not? I haue so, because it is an open roome, and good for winter Why very well then: I hope here be truthes This will last out a night in Russia When nights are longest there: Ile take my leaue, And leaue you to the hearing of the cause; Hoping youle finde good cause to whip them all. I thinke no lesse: good morrow to your Lordship. Now Sir, come on: What was done to Elbowes wife, once more? Once Sir? there was nothing done to her once I beseech you Sir, aske him what this man did to my wife I beseech your honor, aske me Well sir, what did this Gentleman to her? I beseech you sir, looke in this Gentlemans face: good Master Froth looke vpon his honor; 'tis for a good purpose: doth your honor marke his face? I sir, very well Nay, I beseech you marke it well Well, I doe so Doth your honor see any harme in his face? Why no Ile be supposd vpon a booke, his face is the worst thing about him: good then: if his face be the worst thing about him, how could Master Froth doe the Constables wife any harme? I would know that of your honour He's in the right (Constable) what say you to it? First, and it like you, the house is a respected house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his Mistris is a respected woman By this hand Sir, his wife is a more respected person then any of vs all Varlet, thou lyest; thou lyest wicked varlet: the time is yet to come that shee was euer respected with man, woman, or childe Sir, she was respected with him, before he married with her Which is the wiser here; Iustice or Iniquitie? Is this true? O thou caytiffe: O thou varlet: O thou wicked Hanniball; I respected with her, before I was married to her? If euer I was respected with her, or she with me, let not your worship thinke mee the poore Dukes Officer: proue this, thou wicked Hanniball, or ile haue mine action of battry on thee If he tooke you a box o'th' eare, you might haue your action of slander too Marry I thanke your good worship for it: what is't your Worships pleasure I shall doe with this wicked Caitiffe? Truly Officer, because he hath some offences in him, that thou wouldst discouer, if thou couldst, let him continue in his courses, till thou knowst what they are Marry I thanke your worship for it: Thou seest thou wicked varlet now, what's come vpon thee. Thou art to continue now thou Varlet, thou art to continue Where were you borne, friend? Here in Vienna, Sir Are you of fourescore pounds a yeere?

If the Law would allow it, sir But the Law will not allow it Pompey; nor it shall not be allowed in Vienna Do's your Worship meane to geld and splay all the youth of the City? No, Pompey Truely Sir, in my poore opinion they will too't then: if your worship will take order for the drabs and the knaues, you need not to feare the bawds There is pretty orders beginning I can tell you: It is but heading, and hanging If you head, and hang all that offend that way but for ten yeare together; you'll be glad to giue out a Commission for more heads: if this law hold in Vienna ten yeare, ile rent the fairest house in it after three pence a Bay: if you liue to see this come to passe, say Pompey told you so Thanke you good Pompey; and in requitall of your prophesie, harke you: I aduise you let me not finde you before me againe vpon any complaint whatsoeuer; no, not for dwelling where you doe: if I doe Pompey, I shall beat you to your Tent, and proue a shrewd Cæsar to you: in plaine dealing Pompey, I shall haue you whipt; so for this time, Pompey, fare you well I thanke your Worship for your good counsell; but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall better determine. Whip me? no, no, let Carman whip his Iade, The valiant heart's not whipt out of his trade. Come hether to me, Master Elbow: come hither Master Constable: how long haue you bin in this place of Constable? Seuen yeere, and a halfe sir I thought by the readinesse in the office, you had continued in it some time: you say seauen yeares together And a halfe sir Alas, it hath beene great paines to you: they do you wrong to put you so oft vpon't. Are there not men in your Ward sufficient to serue it? 'Faith sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I do it for some peece of money, and goe through with all Looke you bring mee in the names of some sixe or seuen, the most sufficient of your parish To your Worships house sir? To my house: fare you well: what's a clocke, thinke you? Eleuen, Sir I pray you home to dinner with me I humbly thanke you It grieues me for the death of Claudio But there's no remedie: Lord Angelo is seuere It is but needfull. Mercy is not it selfe, that oft lookes so, Pardon is still the nurse of second woe: But yet, poore Claudio; there is no remedie. Come Sir. Scena Secunda. Hee's hearing of a Cause; he will come straight, I'le tell him of you 'Pray you doe; Ile know His pleasure, may be he will relent; alas He hath but as offended in a dreame, All Sects, all Ages smack of this vice, and he To die for't? Now, what's the matter Prouost? Is it your will Claudio shall die to morrow? Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order? Why do'st thou aske againe? Lest I might be too rash: Vnder your good correction I haue seene When after execution, Iudgement hath Repented ore his doome Goe to; let that be mine, Doe you your office, or giue vp your Place, And you shall well be spar'd I craue your Honours pardon: What shall be done Sir, with the groaning Iuliet? Shee's very neere her howre Dispose of her To some more fitter place; and that with speed Here is the sister of the man condemn'd, Desires accesse to you Hath he a Sister?

'Saue your Honour Stay a little while: y'are welcome: what's your will? I am a wofull Sutor to your Honour, 'Please but your Honor heare me Well: what's your suite There is a vice that most I doe abhorre, And most desire should meet the blow of Iustice; For which I would not plead, but that I must, For which I must not plead, but that I am At warre, twixt will, and will not Well: the matter? I haue a brother is condemn'd to die, I doe beseech you let it be his fault, And not my brother Heauen giue thee mouing graces Condemne the fault, and not the actor of it, Why euery fault's condemnd ere it be done: Mine were the verie Cipher of a Function To fine the faults, whose fine stands in record, And let goe by the Actor Oh iust, but seuere Law: I had a brother then; heauen keepe your honour Giue't not ore so: to him againe, entreat him, Kneele downe before him, hang vpon his gowne, You are too cold: if you should need a pin, You could not with more tame a tongue desire it: To him, I say Must he needs die? Maiden, no remedie Yes: I doe thinke that you might pardon him, And neither heauen, nor man grieue at the mercy I will not doe't But can you if you would? Looke what I will not, that I cannot doe But might you doe't & do the world no wrong If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse, As mine is to him? Hee's sentenc'd, tis too late You are too cold Too late? why no: I that doe speak a word May call it againe: well, beleeue this No ceremony that to great ones longs, Not the Kings Crowne; nor the deputed sword, The Marshalls Truncheon, nor the Iudges Robe Become them with one halfe so good a grace As mercie does: If he had bin as you, and you as he, You would haue slipt like him, but he like you Would not haue beene so sterne Pray you be gone I would to heauen I had your potencie, And you were Isabell: should it then be thus? No: I would tell what 'twere to be a Iudge, And what a prisoner I, touch him: there's the veine Your Brother is a forfeit of the Law, And you but waste your words Alas, alas: Why all the soules that were, were forfeit once, And he that might the vantage best haue tooke, Found out the remedie: how would you be, If he, which is the top of Iudgement, should But iudge you, as you are? Oh, thinke on that, And mercie then will breathe within your lips Like man new made Be you content, (faire Maid) It is the Law, not I, condemne your brother, Were he my kinsman, brother, or my sonne, It should be thus with him: he must die to morrow To morrow? oh, that's sodaine, Spare him, spare him: Hee's not prepar'd for death; euen for our kitchins We kill the fowle of season: shall we serue heauen With lesse respect then we doe minister To our grosse-selues? good, good my Lord, bethink you; Who is it that hath di'd for this offence? There's many haue committed it I, well said The Law hath not bin dead, thogh it hath slept Those many had not dar'd to doe that euill If the first, that did th' Edict infringe Had answer'd for his deed. Now 'tis awake, Takes note of what is done, and like a Prophet Lookes in a glasse that shewes what future euils Either now, or by remissenesse, new conceiu'd, And so in progresse to be hatch'd, and borne, Are now to haue no successiue degrees, But here they liue to end Yet shew some pittie I shew it most of all, when I show Iustice; For then I pittie those I doe not know, Which a dismis'd offence, would after gaule And doe him right, that answering one foule wrong Liues not to act another. Be satisfied; Your Brother dies to morrow; be content So you must be y first that giues this sentence, And hee, that suffers: Oh, it is excellent To haue a Giants strength: but it is tyrannous To vse it like a Giant That's well said Could great men thunder As Ioue himselfe do's, Ioue would neuer be quiet, For euery pelting petty Officer Would vse his heauen for thunder; Nothing but thunder: Mercifull heauen, Thou rather with thy sharpe and sulpherous bolt Splits the vn-wedgable and gnarled Oke, Then the soft Mertill: But man, proud man, Drest in a little briefe authoritie, Most ignorant of what he's most assur'd, (His glassie Essence) like an angry Ape Plaies such phantastique tricks before high heauen, As makes the Angels weepe: who with our spleenes, Would all themselues laugh mortall Oh, to him, to him wench: he will relent, Hee's comming: I perceiue't Pray heauen she win him We cannot weigh our brother with our selfe, Great men may iest with Saints: tis wit in them, But in the lesse fowle prophanation Thou'rt i'th right (Girle) more o'that That in the Captaine's but a chollericke word, Which in the Souldier is flat blasphemie Art auis'd o'that? more on't Why doe you put these sayings vpon me? Because Authoritie, though it erre like others, Hath yet a kinde of medicine in it selfe That skins the vice o'th top; goe to your bosome, Knock there, and aske your heart what it doth know That's like my brothers fault: if it confesse A naturall guiltinesse, such as is his, Let it not sound a thought vpon your tongue Against my brothers life Shee speakes, and 'tis such sence That my Sence breeds with it; fare you well Gentle my Lord, turne backe I will bethinke me: come againe to morrow Hark, how Ile bribe you: good my Lord turn back How? bribe me? I, with such gifts that heauen shall share with you You had mar'd all else Not with fond Sickles of the tested-gold, Or Stones, whose rate are either rich, or poore As fancie values them: but with true prayers, That shall be vp at heauen, and enter there Ere Sunne rise: prayers from preserued soules, From fasting Maides, whose mindes are dedicate To nothing temporall Well: come to me to morrow Goe to: 'tis well; away Heauen keepe your honour safe Amen. For I am that way going to temptation, Where prayers crosse At what hower to morrow, Shall I attend your Lordship? At any time 'fore-noone 'Saue your Honour From thee: euen from thy vertue. What's this? what's this? is this her fault, or mine? The Tempter, or the Tempted, who sins most? ha? Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I, That, lying by the Violet in the Sunne, Doe as the Carrion do's, not as the flowre, Corrupt with vertuous season: Can it be, That Modesty may more betray our Sence Then womans lightnesse? hauing waste ground enough, Shall we desire to raze the Sanctuary And pitch our euils there? oh fie, fie, fie: What dost thou? or what art thou Angelo? Dost thou desire her fowly, for those things That make her good? oh, let her brother liue: Theeues for their robbery haue authority, When Iudges steale themselues: what, doe I loue her, That I desire to heare her speake againe? And feast vpon her eyes? what is't I dreame on? Oh cunning enemy, that to catch a Saint, With Saints dost bait thy hooke: most dangerous Is that temptation, that doth goad vs on To sinne, in louing vertue: neuer could the Strumpet With all her double vigor, Art, and Nature Once stir my temper: but this vertuous Maid Subdues me quite: Euer till now When men were fond, I smild, and wondred how. Scena Tertia. Haile to you, Prouost, so I thinke you are I am the Prouost: whats your will, good Frier? Bound by my charity, and my blest order, I come to visite the afflicted spirits Here in the prison: doe me the common right To let me see them: and to make me know The nature of their crimes, that I may minister To them accordingly I would do more then that, if more were needfull Looke here comes one: a Gentlewoman of mine, Who falling in the flawes of her owne youth, Hath blisterd her report: She is with childe, And he that got it, sentenc'd: a yong man, More fit to doe another such offence, Then dye for this When must he dye? As I do thinke to morrow. I haue prouided for you, stay a while And you shall be conducted Repent you (faire one) of the sin you carry? I doe; and beare the shame most patiently Ile teach you how you shal araign your consciece And try your penitence, if it be sound, Or hollowly put on Ile gladly learne Loue you the man that wrong'd you? Yes, as I loue the woman that wrong'd him So then it seemes your most offence full act Was mutually committed Mutually Then was your sin of heauier kinde then his I doe confesse it, and repent it (Father.) 'Tis meet so (daughter) but least you do repent As that the sin hath brought you to this shame, Which sorrow is alwaies toward our selues, not heauen, Showing we would not spare heauen, as we loue it, But as we stand in feare I doe repent me, as it is an euill, And take the shame with ioy There rest: Your partner (as I heare) must die to morrow, And I am going with instruction to him: Grace goe with you, Benedicite. Must die to morrow? oh iniurious Loue That respits me a life, whose very comfort Is still a dying horror 'Tis pitty of him. Scena Quarta. When I would pray, & think, I thinke, and pray To seuerall subiects: heauen hath my empty words, Whilst my Inuention, hearing not my Tongue, Anchors on Isabell: heauen in my mouth, As if I did but onely chew his name, And in my heart the strong and swelling euill Of my conception: the state whereon I studied Is like a good thing, being often read Growne feard, and tedious: yea, my Grauitie Wherein (let no man heare me) I take pride, Could I, with boote, change for an idle plume Which the ayre beats for vaine: oh place, oh forme, How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit Wrench awe from fooles, and tye the wiser soules To thy false seeming? Blood, thou art blood, Let's write good Angell on the Deuills horne 'Tis not the Deuills Crest: how now? who's there? One Isabell, a Sister, desires accesse to you Teach her the way: oh, heauens Why doe's my bloud thus muster to my heart, Making both it vnable for it selfe, And dispossessing all my other parts Of necessary fitnesse? So play the foolish throngs with one that swounds, Come all to help him, and so stop the ayre By which hee should reuiue: and euen so The generall subiect to a wel-wisht King Quit their owne part, and in obsequious fondnesse Crowd to his presence, where their vn-taught loue Must needs appear offence: how now faire Maid. I am come to know your pleasure That you might know it, wold much better please me, Then to demand what 'tis: your Brother cannot liue Euen so: heauen keepe your Honor Yet may he liue a while: and it may be As long as you, or I: yet he must die Vnder your Sentence? Yea When, I beseech you: that in his Reprieue (Longer, or shorter) he may be so fitted That his soule sicken not Ha? fie, these filthy vices: It were as good To pardon him, that hath from nature stolne A man already made, as to remit Their sawcie sweetnes, that do coyne heauens Image In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easie, Falsely to take away a life true made, As to put mettle in restrained meanes To make a false one 'Tis set downe so in heauen, but not in earth Say you so: then I shall poze you quickly. Which had you rather, that the most iust Law Now tooke your brothers life, and to redeeme him Giue vp your body to such sweet vncleannesse As she that he hath staind? Sir, beleeue this. I had rather giue my body, then my soule I talke not of your soule: our compel'd sins Stand more for number, then for accompt How say you? Nay Ile not warrant that: for I can speake Against the thing I say: Answere to this, I (now the voyce of the recorded Law) Pronounce a sentence on your Brothers life, Might there not be a charitie in sinne, To saue this Brothers life? Please you to doo't, Ile take it as a perill to my soule, It is no sinne at all, but charitie Pleas'd you to doo't, at perill of your soule Were equall poize of sinne, and charitie That I do beg his life, if it be sinne Heauen let me beare it: you granting of my suit, If that be sin, Ile make it my Morne-praier, To haue it added to the faults of mine, And nothing of your answere Nay, but heare me, Your sence pursues not mine: either you are ignorant, Or seeme so crafty; and that's not good Let be ignorant, and in nothing good, But graciously to know I am no better Thus wisdome wishes to appeare most bright, When it doth taxe it selfe: As these blacke Masques Proclaime an en-shield beauty ten times louder Then beauty could displaied: But marke me, To be receiued plaine, Ile speake more grosse: Your Brother is to dye So And his offence is so, as it appeares, Accountant to the Law, vpon that paine True Admit no other way to saue his life (As I subscribe not that, nor any other, But in the losse of question) that you, his Sister, Finding your selfe desir'd of such a person, Whose creadit with the Iudge, or owne great place, Could fetch your Brother from the Manacles Of the all-building-Law: and that there were No earthly meane to saue him, but that either You must lay downe the treasures of your body, To this supposed, or else to let him suffer: What would you doe? As much for my poore Brother, as my selfe; That is: were I vnder the tearmes of death, Th' impression of keene whips, I'ld weare as Rubies, And strip my selfe to death, as to a bed, That longing haue bin sicke for, ere I'ld yeeld My body vp to shame Then must your brother die And 'twer the cheaper way: Better it were a brother dide at once, Then that a sister, by redeeming him Should die for euer Were not you then as cruell as the Sentence, That you haue slander'd so? Ignomie in ransome, and free pardon Are of two houses: lawfull mercie, Is nothing kin to fowle redemption You seem'd of late to make the Law a tirant, And rather prou'd the sliding of your brother A merriment, then a vice Oh pardon me my Lord, it oft fals out To haue, what we would haue, We speake not what we meane; I something do excuse the thing I hate, For his aduantage that I dearely loue We are all fraile Else let my brother die, If not a fedarie but onely he Owe, and succeed thy weaknesse Nay, women are fraile too I, as the glasses where they view themselues, Which are as easie broke as they make formes: Women? Helpe heauen; men their creation marre In profiting by them: Nay, call vs ten times fraile, For we are soft, as our complexions are, And credulous to false prints I thinke it well: And from this testimonie of your owne sex (Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger Then faults may shake our frames) let me be bold; I do arrest your words. Be that you are, That is a woman; if you be more, you'r none. If you be one (as you are well exprest By all externall warrants) shew it now, By putting on the destin'd Liuerie I haue no tongue but one; gentle my Lord, Let me entreate you speake the former language Plainlie conceiue I loue you My brother did loue Iuliet, And you tell me that he shall die for't He shall not Isabell if you giue me loue I know your vertue hath a licence in't, Which seemes a little fouler then it is, To plucke on others Beleeue me on mine Honor, My words expresse my purpose Ha? Little honor, to be much beleeu'd, And most pernitious purpose: Seeming, seeming. I will proclaime thee Angelo, looke for't. Signe me a present pardon for my brother, Or with an out-stretcht throate Ile tell the world aloud What man thou art Who will beleeue thee Isabell? My vnsoild name, th' austeerenesse of my life, My vouch against you, and my place i'th State, Will so your accusation ouer-weigh, That you shall stifle in your owne report, And smell of calumnie. I haue begun, And now I giue my sensuall race, the reine, Fit thy consent to my sharpe appetite, Lay by all nicetie, and prolixious blushes That banish what they sue for: Redeeme thy brother, By yeelding vp thy bodie to my will, Or else he must not onelie die the death, But thy vnkindnesse shall his death draw out To lingring sufferance: Answer me to morrow, Or by the affection that now guides me most, Ile proue a Tirant to him. As for you, Say what you can; my false, ore-weighs your true. To whom should I complaine? Did I tell this, Who would beleeue me? O perilous mouthes That beare in them, one and the selfesame tongue, Either of condemnation, or approofe, Bidding the Law make curtsie to their will, Hooking both right and wrong to th' appetite, To follow as it drawes. Ile to my brother, Though he hath falne by prompture of the blood, Yet hath he in him such a minde of Honor, That had he twentie heads to tender downe On twentie bloodie blockes, hee'ld yeeld them vp, Before his sister should her bodie stoope To such abhord pollution. Then Isabell liue chaste, and brother die; ``More then our Brother, is our Chastitie. Ile tell him yet of Angelo's request, And fit his minde to death, for his soules rest. So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo? The miserable haue no other medicine But onely hope: I'haue hope to liue, and am prepar'd to die Be absolute for death: either death or life Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life: If I do loose thee, I do loose a thing That none but fooles would keepe: a breath thou art, Seruile to all the skyie-influences That dost this habitation where thou keepst Hourely afflict: Meerely, thou art deaths foole, For him thou labourst by thy flight to shun, And yet runst toward him still. Thou art not noble, For all th' accommodations that thou bearst, Are nurst by basenesse: Thou'rt by no meanes valiant, For thou dost feare the soft and tender forke Of a poore worme: thy best of rest is sleepe, And that thou oft prouoakst, yet grosselie fearst Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thy selfe, For thou exists on manie a thousand graines That issue out of dust. Happie thou art not, For what thou hast not, still thou striu'st to get, And what thou hast forgetst. Thou art not certaine, For thy complexion shifts to strange effects, After the Moone: If thou art rich, thou'rt poore, For like an Asse, whose backe with Ingots bowes; Thou bearst thy heauie riches but a iournie, And death vnloads thee; Friend hast thou none. For thine owne bowels which do call thee, fire The meere effusion of thy proper loines Do curse the Gowt, Sapego, and the Rheume For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth, nor age But as it were an after-dinners sleepe Dreaming on both, for all thy blessed youth Becomes as aged, and doth begge the almes Of palsied-Eld: and when thou art old, and rich Thou hast neither heate, affection, limbe, nor beautie To make thy riches pleasant: what's yet in this That beares the name of life? Yet in this life Lie hid moe thousand deaths; yet death we feare That makes these oddes, all euen I humblie thanke you. To sue to liue, I finde I seeke to die, And seeking death, finde life: Let it come on. What hoa? Peace heere; Grace, and good companie Who's there? Come in, the wish deserues a welcome Deere sir, ere long Ile visit you againe Most holie Sir, I thanke you My businesse is a word or two with Claudio And verie welcom: looke Signior, here's your sister Prouost, a word with you As manie as you please Bring them to heare me speak, where I may be conceal'd Now sister, what's the comfort? Why, As all comforts are: most good, most good indeede, Lord Angelo hauing affaires to heauen Intends you for his swift Ambassador, Where you shall be an euerlasting Leiger; Therefore your best appointment make with speed, To Morrow you set on Is there no remedie? None, but such remedie, as to saue a head To cleaue a heart in twaine: But is there anie? Yes brother, you may liue; There is a diuellish mercie in the Iudge, If you'l implore it, that will free your life, But fetter you till death Perpetuall durance? I iust, perpetuall durance, a restraint Through all the worlds vastiditie you had To a determin'd scope But in what nature? In such a one, as you consenting too't, Would barke your honor from that trunke you beare, And leaue you naked Let me know the point Oh, I do feare thee Claudio, and I quake, Least thou a feauorous life shouldst entertaine, And six or seuen winters more respect Then a perpetuall Honor. Dar'st thou die? The sence of death is most in apprehension, And the poore Beetle that we treade vpon In corporall sufferance, finds a pang as great, As when a Giant dies Why giue you me this shame? Thinke you I can a resolution fetch From flowrie tendernesse? If I must die, I will encounter darknesse as a bride, And hugge it in mine armes There spake my brother: there my fathers graue Did vtter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die: Thou art too noble, to conserue a life In base appliances. This outward sainted Deputie, Whose setled visage, and deliberate word Nips youth i'th head, and follies doth emmew As Falcon doth the Fowle, is yet a diuell: His filth within being cast, he would appeare A pond, as deepe as hell The prenzie, Angelo? Oh 'tis the cunning Liuerie of hell, The damnest bodie to inuest, and couer In prenzie gardes; dost thou thinke Claudio, If I would yeeld him my virginitie Thou might'st be freed? Oh heauens, it cannot be Yes, he would giu't thee; from this rank offence So to offend him still. This night's the time That I should do what I abhorre to name, Or else thou diest to morrow Thou shalt not do't O, were it but my life, I'de throw it downe for your deliuerance As frankely as a pin Thankes deere Isabell Be readie Claudio, for your death to morrow Yes. Has he affections in him, That thus can make him bite the Law by th' nose, When he would force it? Sure it is no sinne, Or of the deadly seuen it is the least Which is the least? If it were damnable, he being so wise, Why would he for the momentarie tricke Be perdurablie fin'de? Oh Isabell What saies my brother? Death is a fearefull thing And shamed life, a hatefull I, but to die, and go we know not where, To lie in cold obstruction, and to rot, This sensible warme motion, to become A kneaded clod; And the delighted spirit To bath in fierie floods, or to recide In thrilling Region of thicke-ribbed Ice, To be imprison'd in the viewlesse windes And blowne with restlesse violence round about The pendant world: or to be worse then worst Of those, that lawlesse and incertaine thought, Imagine howling, 'tis too horrible. The weariest, and most loathed worldly life That Age, Ache, periury, and imprisonment Can lay on nature, is a Paradise To what we feare of death Alas, alas Sweet Sister, let me liue. What sinne you do, to saue a brothers life, Nature dispenses with the deede so farre, That it becomes a vertue Oh you beast, Oh faithlesse Coward, oh dishonest wretch, Wilt thou be made a man, out of my vice? Is't not a kinde of Incest, to take life From thine owne sisters shame? What should I thinke, Heauen shield my Mother plaid my Father faire: For such a warped slip of wildernesse Nere issu'd from his blood. Take my defiance, Die, perish: Might but my bending downe Repreeue thee from thy fate, it should proceede. Ile pray a thousand praiers for thy death, No word to saue thee Nay heare me Isabell Oh fie, fie, fie: Thy sinn's not accidentall, but a Trade; Mercy to thee would proue it selfe a Bawd, 'Tis best that thou diest quickly Oh heare me Isabella Vouchsafe a word, yong sister, but one word What is your Will Might you dispense with your leysure, I would by and by haue some speech with you: the satisfaction I would require, is likewise your owne benefit I haue no superfluous leysure, my stay must be stolen out of other affaires: but I will attend you a while Son, I haue ouer-heard what hath past between you & your sister. Angelo had neuer the purpose to corrupt her; onely he hath made an assay of her vertue, to practise his iudgement with the disposition of natures. She (hauing the truth of honour in her) hath made him that gracious deniall, which he is most glad to receiue: I am Confessor to Angelo, and I know this to be true, therfore prepare your selfe to death: do not satisfie your resolution with hopes that are fallible, to morrow you must die, goe to your knees, and make ready Let me ask my sister pardon, I am so out of loue with life, that I will sue to be rid of it Hold you there: farewell: Prouost, a word with you What's your will (father?) That now you are come, you wil be gone: leaue me a while with the Maid, my minde promises with my habit, no losse shall touch her by my company In good time. The hand that hath made you faire, hath made you good: the goodnes that is cheape in beauty, makes beauty briefe in goodnes; but grace being the soule of your complexion, shall keepe the body of it euer faire: the assault that Angelo hath made to you, Fortune hath conuaid to my vnderstanding; and but that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should wonder at Angelo: how will you doe to content this Substitute, and to saue your Brother? I am now going to resolue him: I had rather my brother die by the Law, then my sonne should be vnlawfullie borne. But (oh) how much is the good Duke deceiu'd in Angelo: if euer he returne, and I can speake to him, I will open my lips in vaine, or discouer his gouernment That shall not be much amisse: yet, as the matter now stands, he will auoid your accusation: he made triall of you onelie. Therefore fasten your eare on my aduisings, to the loue I haue in doing good; a remedie presents it selfe. I doe make my selfe beleeue that you may most vprighteously do a poor wronged Lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from the angry Law; doe no staine to your owne gracious person, and much please the absent Duke, if peraduenture he shall euer returne to haue hearing of this businesse Let me heare you speake farther; I haue spirit to do any thing that appeares not fowle in the truth of my spirit Vertue is bold, and goodnes neuer fearefull: Haue you not heard speake of Mariana the sister of Fredericke the great Souldier, who miscarried at Sea? I haue heard of the Lady, and good words went with her name Shee should this Angelo haue married: was affianced to her oath, and the nuptiall appointed: between which time of the contract, and limit of the solemnitie, her brother Fredericke was wrackt at Sea, hauing in that perished vessell, the dowry of his sister: but marke how heauily this befell to the poore Gentlewoman, there she lost a noble and renowned brother, in his loue toward her, euer most kinde and naturall: with him the portion and sinew of her fortune, her marriage dowry: with both, her combynate-husband, this well-seeming Angelo Can this be so? did Angelo so leaue her? Left her in her teares, & dried not one of them with his comfort: swallowed his vowes whole, pretending in her, discoueries of dishonor: in few, bestow'd her on her owne lamentation, which she yet weares for his sake: and he, a marble to her teares, is washed with them, but relents not What a merit were it in death to take this poore maid from the world? what corruption in this life, that it will let this man liue? But how out of this can shee auaile? It is a rupture that you may easily heale: and the cure of it not onely saues your brother, but keepes you from dishonor in doing it Shew me how (good Father.) This fore-named Maid hath yet in her the continuance of her first affection: his vniust vnkindenesse (that in all reason should haue quenched her loue) hath (like an impediment in the Current) made it more violent and vnruly: Goe you to Angelo, answere his requiring with a plausible obedience, agree with his demands to the point: onely referre your selfe to this aduantage; first, that your stay with him may not be long: that the time may haue all shadow, and silence in it: and the place answere to conuenience: this being granted in course, and now followes all: wee shall aduise this wronged maid to steed vp your appointment, goe in your place: if the encounter acknowledge it selfe heereafter, it may compell him to her recompence; and heere, by this is your brother saued, your honor vntainted, the poore Mariana aduantaged, and the corrupt Deputy scaled. The Maid will I frame, and make fit for his attempt: if you thinke well to carry this as you may, the doublenes of the benefit defends the deceit from reproofe. What thinke you of it? The image of it giues me content already, and I trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection It lies much in your holding vp: haste you speedily to Angelo, if for this night he intreat you to his bed, giue him promise of satisfaction: I will presently to S. Lukes, there at the moated-Grange recides this deiected Mariana; at that place call vpon me, and dispatch with Angelo, that it may be quickly I thank you for this comfort: fare you well good father. Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will needes buy and sell men and women like beasts, we shall haue all the world drinke browne & white bastard Oh heauens, what stuffe is heere Twas neuer merry world since of two vsuries the merriest was put downe, and the worser allow'd by order of Law; a fur'd gowne to keepe him warme; and furd with Foxe and Lamb-skins too, to signifie, that craft being richer then Innocency, stands for the facing Come your way sir: 'blesse you good Father Frier And you good Brother Father; what offence hath this man made you, Sir? Marry Sir, he hath offended the Law; and Sir, we take him to be a Theefe too Sir: for wee haue found vpon him Sir, a strange Pick-lock, which we haue sent to the Deputie Fie, sirrah, a Bawd, a wicked bawd, The euill that thou causest to be done, That is thy meanes to liue. Do thou but thinke What 'tis to cram a maw, or cloath a backe From such a filthie vice: say to thy selfe, From their abhominable and beastly touches I drinke, I eate away my selfe, and liue: Canst thou beleeue thy liuing is a life, So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend Indeed, it do's stinke in some sort, Sir: But yet Sir I would proue Nay, if the diuell haue giuen thee proofs for sin Thou wilt proue his. Take him to prison Officer: Correction, and Instruction must both worke Ere this rude beast will profit He must before the Deputy Sir, he ha's giuen him warning: the Deputy cannot abide a Whore-master: if he be a Whore-monger, and comes before him, he were as good go a mile on his errand That we were all, as some would seeme to bee From our faults, as faults from seeming free. His necke will come to your wast, a Cord sir I spy comfort, I cry baile: Here's a Gentleman, and a friend of mine How now noble Pompey? What, at the wheels of Cæsar? Art thou led in triumph? What is there none of Pigmalions Images newly made woman to bee had now, for putting the hand in the pocket, and extracting clutch'd? What reply? Ha? What saist thou to this Tune, Matter, and Method? Is't not drown'd i'th last raine? Ha? What saist thou Trot? Is the world as it was Man? Which is the way? Is it sad, and few words? Or how? The tricke of it? Still thus, and thus: still worse? How doth my deere Morsell, thy Mistris? Procures she still? Ha? Troth sir, shee hath eaten vp all her beefe, and she is her selfe in the tub Why 'tis good: It is the right of it: it must be so. Euer your fresh Whore, and your pouder'd Baud, an vnshun'd consequence, it must be so. Art going to prison Pompey? Yes faith sir Why 'tis not amisse Pompey: farewell: goe say I sent thee thether: for debt Pompey? Or how? For being a baud, for being a baud Well, then imprison him: If imprisonment be the due of a baud, why 'tis his right. Baud is he doubtlesse, and of antiquity too: Baud borne. Farwell good Pompey: Commend me to the prison Pompey, you will turne good husband now Pompey, you will keepe the house I hope Sir, your good Worship wil be my baile? No indeed wil I not Pompey, it is not the wear: I will pray (Pompey) to encrease your bondage if you take it not patiently: Why, your mettle is the more: Adieu trustie Pompey. Blesse you Friar And you Do's Bridget paint still, Pompey? Ha? Come your waies sir, come You will not baile me then Sir? Then Pompey, nor now: what newes abroad Frier? What newes? Come your waies sir, come Goe to kennell (Pompey) goe: What newes Frier of the Duke? I know none: can you tell me of any? Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia: other some, he is in Rome: but where is he thinke you? I know not where: but wheresoeuer, I wish him well It was a mad fantasticall tricke of him to steale from the State, and vsurpe the beggerie hee was neuer borne to: Lord Angelo Dukes it well in his absence: he puts transgression too't He do's well in't A little more lenitie to Lecherie would doe no harme in him: Something too crabbed that way, Frier It is too general a vice, and seueritie must cure it Yes in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred; it is well allied, but it is impossible to extirpe it quite, Frier, till eating and drinking be put downe. They say this Angelo was not made by Man and Woman, after this downe-right way of Creation: is it true, thinke you? How should he be made then? Some report, a Sea-maid spawn'd him. Some, that he was begot betweene two Stock-fishes. But it is certaine, that when he makes water, his Vrine is congeal'd ice, that I know to bee true: and he is a motion generatiue, that's infallible You are pleasant sir, and speake apace Why, what a ruthlesse thing is this in him, for the rebellion of a Cod-peece, to take away the life of a man? Would the Duke that is absent haue done this? Ere he would haue hang'd a man for the getting a hundred Bastards, he would haue paide for the Nursing a thousand. He had some feeling of the sport, hee knew the seruice, and that instructed him to mercie I neuer heard the absent Duke much detected for Women, he was not enclin'd that way Oh Sir, you are deceiu'd 'Tis not possible Who, not the Duke? Yes, your beggar of fifty: and his vse was, to put a ducket in her Clack-dish; the Duke had Crochets in him. Hee would be drunke too, that let me informe you You do him wrong, surely Sir, I was an inward of his: a shie fellow was the Duke, and I beleeue I know the cause of his withdrawing What (I prethee) might be the cause? No, pardon: 'Tis a secret must bee lockt within the teeth and the lippes: but this I can let you vnderstand, the greater file of the subiect held the Duke to be wise Wise? Why no question but he was A very superficiall, ignorant, vnweighing fellow Either this is Enuie in you, Folly, or mistaking: The very streame of his life, and the businesse he hath helmed, must vppon a warranted neede, giue him a better proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his owne bringings forth, and hee shall appeare to the enuious, a Scholler, a Statesman, and a Soldier: therefore you speake vnskilfully: or, if your knowledge bee more, it is much darkned in your malice Sir, I know him, and I loue him Loue talkes with better knowledge, & knowledge with deare loue Come Sir, I know what I know I can hardly beleeue that, since you know not what you speake. But if euer the Duke returne (as our praiers are he may) let mee desire you to make your answer before him: if it bee honest you haue spoke, you haue courage to maintaine it; I am bound to call vppon you, and I pray you your name? Sir my name is Lucio, wel known to the Duke He shall know you better Sir, if I may liue to report you I feare you not O, you hope the Duke will returne no more: or you imagine me to vnhurtfull an opposite: but indeed I can doe you little harme: You'll for-sweare this againe? Ile be hang'd first: Thou art deceiu'd in mee But no more of this: Canst thou tell if Claudio die to morrow, or no? Why should he die Sir? Why? For filling a bottle with a Tunne-dish: I would the Duke we talke of were return'd againe: this vngenitur'd Agent will vn-people the Prouince with Sparrowes must not build in his house-eeues, because they are lecherous: The Duke yet would haue darke deeds darkelie answered, hee would neuer bring them to light: would hee were return'd. Marrie this Claudio is condemned for vntrussing. Farwell good Friar, I prethee pray for me: The Duke (I say to thee againe) would eate Mutton on Fridaies. He's now past it, yet (and I say to thee) hee would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt browne-bread and Garlicke: say that I said so: Farewell. No might, nor greatnesse in mortality Can censure scape: Back-wounding calumnie The whitest vertue strikes. What King so strong, Can tie the gall vp in the slanderous tong? But who comes heere? Go, away with her to prison Good my Lord be good to mee, your Honor is accounted a mercifull man: good my Lord Double, and trebble admonition, and still forfeite in the same kinde? This would make mercy sweare and play the Tirant A Bawd of eleuen yeares continuance, may it please your Honor My Lord, this is one Lucio's information against me, Mistris Kate Keepe-downe was with childe by him in the Dukes time, he promis'd her marriage: his Childe is a yeere and a quarter olde come Philip and Iacob: I haue kept it my selfe; and see how hee goes about to abuse me That fellow is a fellow of much License: Let him be call'd before vs, Away with her to prison: Goe too, no more words. Prouost, my Brother Angelo will not be alter'd, Claudio must die to morrow: Let him be furnish'd with Diuines, and haue all charitable preparation. If my brother wrought by my pitie, it should not be so with him So please you, this Friar hath beene with him, and aduis'd him for th' entertainment of death Good' euen, good Father Blisse, and goodnesse on you Of whence are you? Not of this Countrie, though my chance is now To vse it for my time: I am a brother Of gracious Order, late come from the Sea, In speciall businesse from his Holinesse What newes abroad i'th World? None, but that there is so great a Feauor on goodnesse, that the dissolution of it must cure it. Noueltie is onely in request, and as it is as dangerous to be aged in any kinde of course, as it is vertuous to be constant in any vndertaking. There is scarse truth enough aliue to make Societies secure, but Securitie enough to make Fellowships accurst: Much vpon this riddle runs the wisedome of the world: This newes is old enough, yet it is euerie daies newes. I pray you Sir, of what disposition was the Duke? One, that aboue all other strifes, Contended especially to know himselfe What pleasure was he giuen to? Rather reioycing to see another merry, then merrie at anie thing which profest to make him reioice. A Gentleman of all temperance. But leaue wee him to his euents, with a praier they may proue prosperous, & let me desire to know, how you finde Claudio prepar'd? I am made to vnderstand, that you haue lent him visitation He professes to haue receiued no sinister measure from his Iudge, but most willingly humbles himselfe to the determination of Iustice: yet had he framed to himselfe (by the instruction of his frailty) manie deceyuing promises of life, which I (by my good leisure) haue discredited to him, and now is he resolu'd to die You haue paid the heauens your Function, and the prisoner the verie debt of your Calling. I haue labour'd for the poore Gentleman, to the extremest shore of my modestie, but my brother-Iustice haue I found so seuere, that he hath forc'd me to tell him, hee is indeede Iustice If his owne life, Answere the straitnesse of his proceeding, It shall become him well: wherein if he chance to faile he hath sentenc'd himselfe Esc I am going to visit the prisoner, Fare you well Peace be with you. He who the sword of Heauen will beare, Should be as holy, as seueare: Patterne in himselfe to know, Grace to stand, and Vertue go: More, nor lesse to others paying, Then by selfe-offences weighing. Shame to him, whose cruell striking, Kils for faults of his owne liking: Twice trebble shame on Angelo, To weede my vice, and let his grow. Oh, what may Man within him hide, Though Angel on the outward side? How may likenesse made in crimes, Making practise on the Times, To draw with ydle Spiders strings Most ponderous and substantiall things? Craft against vice, I must applie. With Angelo to night shall lye His old betroathed (but despised:) So disguise shall by th' disguised Pay with falshood, false exacting, And performe an olde contracting. Take, oh take those lips away, that so sweetly were forsworne, And those eyes: the breake of day lights that doe mislead the Morne; But my kisses bring againe, bring againe, Seales of loue, but seal'd in vaine, seal'd in vaine. Breake off thy song, and haste thee quick away, Here comes a man of comfort, whose aduice Hath often still'd my brawling discontent. I cry you mercie, Sir, and well could wish You had not found me here so musicall. Let me excuse me, and beleeue me so, My mirth it much displeas'd, but pleas'd my woe 'Tis good; though Musick oft hath such a charme To make bad, good; and good prouoake to harme. I pray you tell me, hath any body enquir'd for mee here to day; much vpon this time haue I promis'd here to meete You haue not bin enquir'd after: I haue sat here all day. I doe constantly beleeue you: the time is come euen now. I shall craue your forbearance a little, may be I will call vpon you anone for some aduantage to your selfe I am alwayes bound to you. Very well met, and well come: What is the newes from this good Deputie? He hath a Garden circummur'd with Bricke, Whose westerne side is with a Vineyard back't; And to that Vineyard is a planched gate, That makes his opening with this bigger Key: This other doth command a little doore, Which from the Vineyard to the Garden leades, There haue I made my promise, vpon the Heauy midle of the night, to call vpon him But shall you on your knowledge find this way? I haue t'ane a due, and wary note vpon't, With whispering, and most guiltie diligence, In action all of precept, he did show me The way twice ore Are there no other tokens Betweene you 'greed, concerning her obseruance? No: none but onely a repaire ith' darke, And that I haue possest him, my most stay Can be but briefe: for I haue made him know, I haue a Seruant comes with me along That staies vpon me; whose perswasion is, I come about my Brother 'Tis well borne vp. I haue not yet made knowne to Mariana A word of this: what hoa, within; come forth, I pray you be acquainted with this Maid, She comes to doe you good I doe desire the like Do you perswade your selfe that I respect you? Good Frier, I know you do, and haue found it Take then this your companion by the hand Who hath a storie readie for your eare: I shall attend your leisure, but make haste The vaporous night approaches Wilt please you walke aside. Oh Place, and greatnes: millions of false eies Are stucke vpon thee: volumes of report Run with these false, and most contrarious Quest Vpon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit Make thee the father of their idle dreame, And racke thee in their fancies. Welcome, how agreed? Shee'll take the enterprize vpon her father, If you aduise it It is not my consent, But my entreaty too Little haue you to say When you depart from him, but soft and low, Remember now my brother Feare me not Nor gentle daughter, feare you not at all: He is your husband on a pre-contract: To bring you thus together 'tis no sinne, Sith that the Iustice of your title to him Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let vs goe, Our Corne's to reape, for yet our Tithes to sow. Scena Secunda. Come hither sirha; can you cut off a mans head? If the man be a Bachelor Sir, I can: But if he be a married man, he's his wiues head, And I can neuer cut off a womans head Come sir, leaue me your snatches, and yeeld mee a direct answere. To morrow morning are to die Claudio and Barnardine: heere is in our prison a common executioner, who in his office lacks a helper, if you will take it on you to assist him, it shall redeeme you from your Gyues: if not, you shall haue your full time of imprisonment, and your deliuerance with an vnpittied whipping; for you haue beene a notorious bawd Sir, I haue beene an vnlawfull bawd, time out of minde, but yet I will bee content to be a lawfull hangman: I would bee glad to receiue some instruction from my fellow partner What hoa, Abhorson: where's Abhorson there? Doe you call sir? Sirha, here's a fellow will helpe you to morrow in your execution: if you thinke it meet, compound with him by the yeere, and let him abide here with you, if not, vse him for the present, and dismisse him, hee cannot plead his estimation with you: he hath beene a Bawd A Bawd Sir? fie vpon him, he will discredit our mysterie Goe too Sir, you waigh equallie: a feather will turne the Scale. Pray sir, by your good fauor: for surely sir, a good fauor you haue, but that you haue a hanging look: Doe you call sir, your occupation a Mysterie? I Sir, a Misterie Painting Sir, I haue heard say, is a Misterie; and your Whores sir, being members of my occupation, vsing painting, do proue my Occupation, a Misterie: but what Misterie there should be in hanging, if I should be hang'd, I cannot imagine Sir, it is a Misterie Proofe Euerie true mans apparrell fits your Theefe If it be too little for your theefe, your true man thinkes it bigge enough. If it bee too bigge for your Theefe, your Theefe thinkes it little enough: So euerie true mans apparrell fits your Theefe. Are you agreed? Sir, I will serue him: For I do finde your Hangman is a more penitent Trade then your Bawd: he doth oftner aske forgiuenesse You sirrah, prouide your blocke and your Axe to morrow, foure a clocke Come on (Bawd) I will instruct thee in my Trade: follow I do desire to learne sir: and I hope, if you haue occasion to vse me for your owne turne, you shall finde me y'are. For truly sir, for your kindnesse, I owe you a good turne. Call hether Barnardine and Claudio: Th' one has my pitie; not a iot the other, Being a Murtherer, though he were my brother. Looke, here's the Warrant Claudio, for thy death, 'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to morrow Thou must be made immortall. Where's Barnardine? As fast lock'd vp in sleepe, as guiltlesse labour, When it lies starkely in the Trauellers bones, He will not wake Who can do good on him? Well, go, prepare your selfe. But harke, what noise? Heauen giue your spirits comfort: by, and by, I hope it is some pardon, or repreeue For the most gentle Claudio. Welcome Father. The best, and wholsomst spirits of the night, Inuellop you, good Prouost: who call'd heere of late? None since the Curphew rung Not Isabell? No They will then er't be long What comfort is for Claudio? There's some in hope It is a bitter Deputie Not so, not so: his life is paralel'd Euen with the stroke and line of his great Iustice: He doth with holie abstinence subdue That in himselfe, which he spurres on his powre To qualifie in others: were he meal'd with that Which he corrects, then were he tirrannous, But this being so, he's iust. Now are they come. This is a gentle Prouost, sildome when The steeled Gaoler is the friend of men: How now? what noise? That spirit's possest with hast, That wounds th' vnsisting Posterne with these strokes There he must stay vntil the Officer Arise to let him in: he is call'd vp Haue you no countermand for Claudio yet? But he must die to morrow? None Sir, none As neere the dawning Prouost, as it is, You shall heare more ere Morning Happely You something know: yet I beleeue there comes No countermand: no such example haue we: Besides, vpon the verie siege of Iustice, Lord Angelo hath to the publike eare Profest the contrarie. This is his Lords man And heere comes Claudio's pardon My Lord hath sent you this note, And by mee this further charge; That you swerue not from the smallest Article of it, Neither in time, matter, or other circumstance. Good morrow: for as I take it, it is almost day I shall obey him This is his Pardon purchas'd by such sin, For which the Pardoner himselfe is in: Hence hath offence his quicke celeritie, When it is borne in high Authority. When Vice makes Mercie; Mercie's so extended, That for the faults loue, is th' offender friended. Now Sir, what newes? I told you: Lord Angelo (be-like) thinking me remisse In mine Office, awakens mee With this vnwonted putting on, methinks strangely: For he hath not vs'd it before Pray you let's heare. The Letter. Whatsoeuer you may heare to the contrary, let Claudio be executed by foure of the clocke, and in the afternoone Bernardine: For my better satisfaction, let mee haue Claudios head sent me by fiue. Let this be duely performed with a thought that more depends on it, then we must yet deliuer. Thus faile not to doe your Office, as you will answere it at your perill. What say you to this Sir? What is that Barnardine, who is to be executed in th' afternoone? A Bohemian borne: But here nurst vp & bred, One that is a prisoner nine yeeres old How came it, that the absent Duke had not either deliuer'd him to his libertie, or executed him? I haue heard it was euer his manner to do so His friends still wrought Repreeues for him: And indeed his fact till now in the gouernment of Lord Angelo, came not to an vndoubtfull proofe It is now apparant? Most manifest, and not denied by himselfe Hath he borne himselfe penitently in prison? How seemes he to be touch'd? A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully, but as a drunken sleepe, carelesse, wreaklesse, and fearelesse of what's past, present, or to come: insensible of mortality, and desperately mortall He wants aduice He wil heare none: he hath euermore had the liberty of the prison: giue him leaue to escape hence, hee would not. Drunke many times a day, if not many daies entirely drunke. We haue verie oft awak'd him, as if to carrie him to execution, and shew'd him a seeming warrant for it, it hath not moued him at all More of him anon: There is written in your brow Prouost, honesty and constancie; if I reade it not truly, my ancient skill beguiles me: but in the boldnes of my cunning, I will lay my selfe in hazard: Claudio, whom heere you haue warrant to execute, is no greater forfeit to the Law, then Angelo who hath sentenc'd him. To make you vnderstand this in a manifested effect, I craue but foure daies respit: for the which, you are to do me both a present, and a dangerous courtesie Pray Sir, in what? In the delaying death Alacke, how may I do it? Hauing the houre limited, and an expresse command, vnder penaltie, to deliuer his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case as Claudio's, to crosse this in the smallest By the vow of mine Order, I warrant you, If my instructions may be your guide, Let this Barnardine be this morning executed, And his head borne to Angelo Angelo hath seene them both, And will discouer the fauour Oh, death's a great disguiser, and you may adde to it; Shaue the head, and tie the beard, and say it was the desire of the penitent to be so bar'de before his death: you know the course is common. If any thing fall to you vpon this, more then thankes and good fortune, by the Saint whom I professe, I will plead against it with my life Pardon me, good Father, it is against my oath Were you sworne to the Duke, or to the Deputie? To him, and to his Substitutes You will thinke you haue made no offence, if the Duke auouch the iustice of your dealing? But what likelihood is in that? Not a resemblance, but a certainty; yet since I see you fearfull, that neither my coate, integrity, nor perswasion, can with ease attempt you, I wil go further then I meant, to plucke all feares out of you. Looke you Sir, heere is the hand and Seale of the Duke: you know the Charracter I doubt not, and the Signet is not strange to you? I know them both The Contents of this, is the returne of the Duke; you shall anon ouer-reade it at your pleasure: where you shall finde within these two daies, he wil be heere. This is a thing that Angelo knowes not, for hee this very day receiues letters of strange tenor, perchance of the Dukes death, perchance entering into some Monasterie, but by chance nothing of what is writ. Looke, th' vnfolding Starre calles vp the Shepheard; put not your selfe into amazement, how these things should be; all difficulties are but easie when they are knowne. Call your executioner, and off with Barnardines head: I will giue him a present shrift, and aduise him for a better place. Yet you are amaz'd, but this shall absolutely resolue you: Come away, it is almost cleere dawne. Scena Tertia. I am as well acquainted heere, as I was in our house of profession: one would thinke it were Mistris Ouerdons owne house, for heere be manie of her olde First, here's yong Mr Rash, hee's in for a commoditie of browne paper, and olde Ginger, nine score and seuenteene pounds, of which hee made fiue Markes readie money: marrie then, Ginger was not much in request, for the olde Women were all dead. Then is there heere one Mr Caper, at the suite of Master Three-Pile the Mercer, for some foure suites of Peachcolour'd Satten, which now peaches him a beggar. Then haue we heere, yong Dizie, and yong Mr Deepevow, and Mr Copperspurre, and Mr Starue-Lackey the Rapier and dagger man, and yong Drop-heire that kild lustie Pudding, and Mr Forthlight the Tilter, and braue Mr Shootie the great Traueller, and wilde Halfe-Canne that stabb'd Pots, and I thinke fortie more, all great doers in our Trade, and are now for the Lords sake. Sirrah, bring Barnardine hether Mr Barnardine, you must rise and be hang'd, Mr Barnardine What hoa Barnardine. Barnardine within. A pox o'your throats: who makes that noyse there? What are you? Your friends Sir, the Hangman: You must be so good Sir to rise, and be put to death Away you Rogue, away, I am sleepie Tell him he must awake, And that quickly too Pray Master Barnardine, awake till you are executed, and sleepe afterwards Go in to him, and fetch him out He is comming Sir, he is comming: I heare his Straw russle. Is the Axe vpon the blocke, sirrah? Verie readie Sir How now Abhorson? What's the newes with you? Truly Sir, I would desire you to clap into your prayers: for looke you, the Warrants come You Rogue, I haue bin drinking all night, I am not fitted for't Oh, the better Sir: for he that drinkes all night, and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleepe the sounder all the next day. Looke you Sir, heere comes your ghostly Father: do we iest now thinke you? Sir, induced by my charitie, and hearing how hastily you are to depart, I am come to aduise you, Comfort you, and pray with you Friar, not I: I haue bin drinking hard all night, and I will haue more time to prepare mee, or they shall beat out my braines with billets: I will not consent to die this day, that's certaine Oh sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you Looke forward on the iournie you shall go I sweare I will not die to day for anie mans perswasion But heare you: Not a word: if you haue anie thing to say to me, come to my Ward: for thence will not I to day. Vnfit to liue, or die: oh grauell heart. After him (Fellowes) bring him to the blocke Now Sir, how do you finde the prisoner? A creature vnprepar'd, vnmeet for death, And to transport him in the minde he is, Were damnable Heere in the prison, Father, There died this morning of a cruell Feauor, One Ragozine, a most notorious Pirate, A man of Claudio's yeares: his beard, and head Iust of his colour. What if we do omit This Reprobate, til he were wel enclin'd, And satisfie the Deputie with the visage Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio? Oh, 'tis an accident that heauen prouides: Dispatch it presently, the houre drawes on Prefixt by Angelo: See this be done, And sent according to command, whiles I Perswade this rude wretch willingly to die This shall be done (good Father) presently: But Barnardine must die this afternoone, And how shall we continue Claudio, To saue me from the danger that might come, If he were knowne aliue? Let this be done, Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio, Ere twice the Sun hath made his iournall greeting To yond generation, you shal finde Your safetie manifested I am your free dependant. Quicke, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo Now wil I write Letters to Angelo, (The Prouost he shal beare them) whose contents Shal witnesse to him I am neere at home: And that by great Iniunctions I am bound To enter publikely: him Ile desire To meet me at the consecrated Fount, A League below the Citie: and from thence, By cold gradation, and weale-ballanc'd forme. We shal proceed with Angelo. Heere is the head, Ile carrie it my selfe Conuenient is it: Make a swift returne, For I would commune with you of such things, That want no eare but yours Ile make all speede. Isabell within. Peace hoa, be heere The tongue of Isabell. She's come to know, If yet her brothers pardon be come hither: But I will keepe her ignorant of her good, To make her heauenly comforts of dispaire, When it is least expected. Hoa, by your leaue Good morning to you, faire, and gracious daughter The better giuen me by so holy a man, Hath yet the Deputie sent my brothers pardon? He hath releasd him, Isabell, from the world, His head is off, and sent to Angelo Nay, but it is not so It is no other, Shew your wisedome daughter in your close patience Oh, I wil to him, and plucke out his eies You shal not be admitted to his sight Vnhappie Claudio, wretched Isabell, Iniurious world, most damned Angelo This nor hurts him, nor profits you a iot, Forbeare it therefore, giue your cause to heauen. Marke what I say, which you shal finde By euery sillable a faithful veritie. The Duke comes home to morrow: nay drie your eyes, One of our Couent, and his Confessor Giues me this instance: Already he hath carried Notice to Escalus and Angelo, Who do prepare to meete him at the gates, There to giue vp their powre: If you can pace your wisdome, In that good path that I would wish it go, And you shal haue your bosome on this wretch, Grace of the Duke, reuenges to your heart, And general Honor I am directed by you This Letter then to Friar Peter giue, 'Tis that he sent me of the Dukes returne: Say, by this token, I desire his companie At Mariana's house to night. Her cause, and yours Ile perfect him withall, and he shal bring you Before the Duke; and to the head of Angelo Accuse him home and home. For my poore selfe, I am combined by a sacred Vow, And shall be absent. Wend you with this Letter: Command these fretting waters from your eies With a light heart; trust not my holie Order If I peruert your course: whose heere? Good' euen; Frier, where's the Prouost? Not within Sir Oh prettie Isabella, I am pale at mine heart, to see thine eyes so red: thou must be patient; I am faine to dine and sup with water and bran: I dare not for my head fill my belly. One fruitful Meale would set mee too't: but they say the Duke will be heere to Morrow. By my troth Isabell I lou'd thy brother, if the olde fantastical Duke of darke corners had bene at home, he had liued Sir, the Duke is marueilous little beholding to your reports, but the best is, he liues not in them Friar, thou knowest not the Duke so wel as I do: he's a better woodman then thou tak'st him for Well: you'l answer this one day. Fare ye well Nay tarrie, Ile go along with thee, I can tel thee pretty tales of the Duke You haue told me too many of him already sir if they be true: if not true, none were enough I was once before him for getting a Wench with childe Did you such a thing? Yes marrie did I; but I was faine to forswear it, They would else haue married me to the rotten Medler Sir your company is fairer then honest, rest you well By my troth Ile go with thee to the lanes end: if baudy talke offend you, wee'l haue very litle of it: nay Friar, I am a kind of Burre, I shal sticke. Scena Quarta. Euery Letter he hath writ, hath disuouch'd other In most vneuen and distracted manner, his actions show much like to madnesse, pray heauen his wisedome bee not tainted: and why meet him at the gates and deliuer our authorities there? I ghesse not And why should wee proclaime it in an howre before his entring, that if any craue redresse of iniustice, they should exhibit their petitions in the street? He showes his reason for that: to haue a dispatch of Complaints, and to deliuer vs from deuices heereafter, which shall then haue no power to stand against vs Well: I beseech you let it bee proclaim'd betimes i'th' morne, Ile call you at your house: giue notice to such men of sort and suite as are to meete him I shall sir: fareyouwell. Good night. This deede vnshapes me quite, makes me vnpregnant And dull to all proceedings. A deflowred maid, And by an eminent body, that enforc'd The Law against it? But that her tender shame Will not proclaime against her maiden losse, How might she tongue me? yet reason dares her no, For my Authority beares of a credent bulke, That no particular scandall once can touch But it confounds the breather. He should haue liu'd, Saue that his riotous youth with dangerous sense Might in the times to come haue ta'ne reuenge By so receiuing a dishonor'd life With ransome of such shame: would yet he had liued. Alack, when once our grace we haue forgot, Nothing goes right, we would, and we would not. Scena Quinta. These Letters at fit time deliuer me, The Prouost knowes our purpose and our plot, The matter being a foote, keepe your instruction And hold you euer to our speciall drift, Though sometimes you doe blench from this to that As cause doth minister: Goe call at Flauia's house, And tell him where I stay: giue the like notice To Valencius, Rowland, and to Crassus, And bid them bring the Trumpets to the gate: But send me Flauius first It shall be speeded well. I thank thee Varrius, thou hast made good hast, Come, we will walke: There's other of our friends Will greet vs heere anon: my gentle Varrius. Scena Sexta. To speake so indirectly I am loath, I would say the truth, but to accuse him so That is your part, yet I am aduis'd to doe it, He saies, to vaile full purpose Be rul'd by him Besides he tells me, that if peraduenture He speake against me on the aduerse side, I should not thinke it strange, for 'tis a physicke That's bitter, to sweet end. I would Frier Peter Oh peace, the Frier is come Come I haue found you out a stand most fit, Where you may haue such vantage on the Duke He shall not passe you: Twice haue the Trumpets sounded. The generous, and grauest Citizens Haue hent the gates, and very neere vpon The Duke is entring: Therefore hence away. seuerall doores. My very worthy Cosen, fairely met, Our old, and faithfull friend, we are glad to see you Esc. Happy returne be to your royall grace Many and harty thankings to you both: We haue made enquiry of you, and we heare Such goodnesse of your Iustice, that our soule Cannot but yeeld you forth to publique thankes Forerunning more requitall You make my bonds still greater Oh your desert speaks loud, & I should wrong it To locke it in the wards of couert bosome When it deserues with characters of brasse A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time, And razure of obliuion: Giue we your hand And let the Subiect see, to make them know That outward curtesies would faine proclaime Fauours that keepe within: Come Escalus, You must walke by vs, on our other hand: And good supporters are you. Now is your time Speake loud, and kneele before him Iustice, O royall Duke, vaile your regard Vpon a wrong'd (I would faine haue said a Maid) Oh worthy Prince, dishonor not your eye By throwing it on any other obiect, Till you haue heard me, in my true complaint, And giuen me Iustice, Iustice, Iustice, Iustice Relate your wrongs; In what, by whom? be briefe: Here is Lord Angelo shall giue you Iustice, Reueale your selfe to him Oh worthy Duke, You bid me seeke redemption of the diuell, Heare me your selfe: for that which I must speake Must either punish me, not being beleeu'd, Or wring redresse from you: Heare me: oh heare me, heere My Lord, her wits I feare me are not firme: She hath bin a suitor to me, for her Brother Cut off by course of Iustice By course of Iustice And she will speake most bitterly, and strange Most strange: but yet most truely wil I speake, That Angelo's forsworne, is it not strange? That Angelo's a murtherer, is't not strange? That Angelo is an adulterous thiefe, An hypocrite, a virgin violator, Is it not strange? and strange? Nay it is ten times strange? It is not truer he is Angelo, Then this is all as true, as it is strange; Nay, it is ten times true, for truth is truth To th' end of reckning Away with her: poore soule She speakes this, in th' infirmity of sence Oh Prince, I coniure thee, as thou beleeu'st There is another comfort, then this world, That thou neglect me not, with that opinion That I am touch'd with madnesse: make not impossible That which but seemes vnlike, 'tis not impossible But one, the wickedst caitiffe on the ground May seeme as shie, as graue, as iust, as absolute: As Angelo, euen so may Angelo In all his dressings, caracts, titles, formes, Be an arch-villaine: Beleeue it, royall Prince If he be lesse, he's nothing, but he's more, Had I more name for badnesse By mine honesty If she be mad, as I beleeue no other, Her madnesse hath the oddest frame of sense, Such a dependancy of thing, on thing, As ere I heard in madnesse Oh gracious Duke Harpe not on that; nor do not banish reason For inequality, but let your reason serue To make the truth appeare, where it seemes hid, And hide the false seemes true Many that are not mad Haue sure more lacke of reason: What would you say? I am the Sister of one Claudio, Condemnd vpon the Act of Fornication To loose his head, condemn'd by Angelo, I, (in probation of a Sisterhood) Was sent to by my Brother; one Lucio As then the Messenger That's I, and't like your Grace: I came to her from Claudio, and desir'd her, To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo, For her poore Brothers pardon That's he indeede You were not bid to speake No, my good Lord, Nor wish'd to hold my peace I wish you now then, Pray you take note of it: and when you haue A businesse for your selfe: pray heauen you then Be perfect I warrant your honor The warrant's for your selfe: take heede to't This Gentleman told somewhat of my Tale Right It may be right, but you are i'the wrong To speake before your time: proceed, I went To this pernicious Caitiffe Deputie That's somewhat madly spoken Pardon it, The phrase is to the matter Mended againe: the matter: proceed In briefe, to set the needlesse processe by: How I perswaded, how I praid, and kneel'd, How he refeld me, and how I replide (For this was of much length) the vild conclusion I now begin with griefe, and shame to vtter. He would not, but by gift of my chaste body To his concupiscible intemperate lust Release my brother; and after much debatement, My sisterly remorse, confutes mine honour, And I did yeeld to him: But the next morne betimes, His purpose surfetting, he sends a warrant For my poore brothers head This is most likely Oh that it were as like as it is true By heauen (fond wretch) y knowst not what thou speak'st, Or else thou art suborn'd against his honor In hatefull practise: first his Integritie Stands without blemish: next it imports no reason, That with such vehemency he should pursue Faults proper to himselfe: if he had so offended He would haue waigh'd thy brother by himselfe, And not haue cut him off: some one hath set you on: Confesse the truth, and say by whose aduice Thou cam'st heere to complaine And is this all? Then oh you blessed Ministers aboue Keepe me in patience, and with ripened time Vnfold the euill, which is heere wrapt vp In countenance: heauen shield your Grace from woe, As I thus wrong'd, hence vnbeleeued goe I know you'ld faine be gone: An Officer: To prison with her: Shall we thus permit A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall, On him so neere vs? This needs must be a practise: Who knew of your intent and comming hither? One that I would were heere, Frier Lodowick A ghostly Father, belike: Who knowes that Lodowicke? My Lord, I know him, 'tis a medling Fryer, I doe not like the man: had he been Lay my Lord, For certaine words he spake against your Grace In your retirment, I had swing'd him soundly Words against mee? this' a good Fryer belike And to set on this wretched woman here Against our Substitute: Let this Fryer be found But yesternight my Lord, she and that Fryer I saw them at the prison: a sawcy Fryar, A very scuruy fellow Blessed be your Royall Grace: I haue stood by my Lord, and I haue heard Your royall eare abus'd: first hath this woman Most wrongfully accus'd your Substitute, Who is as free from touch, or soyle with her As she from one vngot We did beleeue no lesse. Know you that Frier Lodowick that she speakes of? I know him for a man diuine and holy, Not scuruy, nor a temporary medler As he's reported by this Gentleman: And on my trust, a man that neuer yet Did (as he vouches) mis-report your Grace My Lord, most villanously, beleeue it Well: he in time may come to cleere himselfe; But at this instant he is sicke, my Lord: Of a strange Feauor: vpon his meere request Being come to knowledge, that there was complaint Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hether To speake as from his mouth, what he doth know Is true, and false: And what he with his oath And all probation will make vp full cleare Whensoeuer he's conuented: First for this woman, To iustifie this worthy Noble man So vulgarly and personally accus'd, Her shall you heare disproued to her eyes, Till she her selfe confesse it Good Frier, let's heare it: Doe you not smile at this, Lord Angelo? Oh heauen, the vanity of wretched fooles. Giue vs some seates, Come cosen Angelo, In this I'll be impartiall: be you Iudge Of your owne Cause: Is this the Witnes Frier? First, let her shew your face, and after, speake Pardon my Lord, I will not shew my face Vntill my husband bid me What, are you married? No my Lord Are you a Maid? No my Lord A Widow then? Neither, my Lord Why you are nothing then: neither Maid, Widow, nor Wife? My Lord, she may be a Puncke: for many of them, are neither Maid, Widow, nor Wife Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause to prattle for himselfe Well my Lord My Lord, I doe confesse I nere was married, And I confesse besides, I am no Maid, I haue known my husband, yet my husband Knowes not, that euer he knew me He was drunk then, my Lord, it can be no better For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so to Well, my Lord This is no witnesse for Lord Angelo Now I come to't, my Lord. Shee that accuses him of Fornication, In selfe-same manner, doth accuse my husband, And charges him, my Lord, with such a time, When I'le depose I had him in mine Armes With all th' effect of Loue Charges she moe then me? Not that I know No? you say your husband Why iust, my Lord, and that is Angelo, Who thinkes he knowes, that he nere knew my body, But knows, he thinkes, that he knowes Isabels This is a strange abuse: Let's see thy face My husband bids me, now I will vnmaske. This is that face, thou cruell Angelo Which once thou sworst, was worth the looking on: This is the hand, which with a vowd contract Was fast belockt in thine: This is the body That tooke away the match from Isabell, And did supply thee at thy garden-house In her Imagin'd person Know you this woman? Carnallie she saies Sirha, no more Enough my Lord My Lord, I must confesse, I know this woman, And fiue yeres since there was some speech of marriage Betwixt my selfe, and her: which was broke off, Partly for that her promis'd proportions Came short of Composition: But in chiefe For that her reputation was dis-valued In leuitie: Since which time of fiue yeres I neuer spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her Vpon my faith, and honor Noble Prince, As there comes light from heauen, and words fro breath, As there is sence in truth, and truth in vertue, I am affianced this mans wife, as strongly As words could make vp vowes: And my good Lord, But Tuesday night last gon, in's garden house, He knew me as a wife. As this is true, Let me in safety raise me from my knees, Or else for euer be confixed here A Marble Monument I did but smile till now, Now, good my Lord, giue me the scope of Iustice, My patience here is touch'd: I doe perceiue These poore informall women, are no more But instruments of some more mightier member That sets them on. Let me haue way, my Lord To finde this practise out I, with my heart, And punish them to your height of pleasure. Thou foolish Frier, and thou pernicious woman Compact with her that's gone: thinkst thou, thy oathes, Though they would swear downe each particular Saint, Were testimonies against his worth, and credit That's seald in approbation? you, Lord Escalus Sit with my Cozen, lend him your kinde paines To finde out this abuse, whence 'tis deriu'd. There is another Frier that set them on, Let him be sent for Would he were here, my Lord, for he indeed Hath set the women on to this Complaint; Your Prouost knowes the place where he abides, And he may fetch him Goe, doe it instantly: And you, my noble and well-warranted Cosen Whom it concernes to heare this matter forth, Doe with your iniuries as seemes you best In any chastisement; I for a while Will leaue you; but stir not you till you haue Well determin'd vpon these Slanderers. My Lord, wee'll doe it throughly: Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that Frier Lodowick to be a dishonest person? Cucullus non facit Monachum, honest in nothing but in his Clothes, and one that hath spoke most villanous speeches of the Duke We shall intreat you to abide heere till he come, and inforce them against him: we shall finde this Frier a notable fellow As any in Vienna, on my word Call that same Isabell here once againe, I would speake with her: pray you, my Lord, giue mee leaue to question, you shall see how Ile handle her Not better then he, by her owne report Say you? Marry sir, I thinke, if you handled her priuately She would sooner confesse, perchance publikely she'll be asham'd. I will goe darkely to worke with her That's the way: for women are light at midnight Come on Mistris, here's a Gentlewoman, Denies all that you haue said My Lord, here comes the rascall I spoke of, Here, with the Prouost In very good time: speake not you to him, till we call vpon you Mum Come Sir, did you set these women on to slander Lord Angelo? they haue confes'd you did 'Tis false How? Know you where you are? Respect to your great place; and let the diuell Be sometime honour'd, for his burning throne. Where is the Duke? 'tis he should heare me speake The Duke's in vs: and we will heare you speake, Looke you speake iustly Boldly, at least. But oh poore soules, Come you to seeke the Lamb here of the Fox; Good night to your redresse: Is the Duke gone? Then is your cause gone too: The Duke's vniust, Thus to retort your manifest Appeale, And put your triall in the villaines mouth, Which here you come to accuse This is the rascall: this is he I spoke of Why thou vnreuerend, and vnhallowed Fryer: Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women, To accuse this worthy man? but in foule mouth, And in the witnesse of his proper eare, To call him villaine; and then to glance from him, To th'Duke himselfe, to taxe him with Iniustice? Take him hence; to th' racke with him: we'll towze you Ioynt by ioynt, but we will know his purpose: What? vniust? Be not so hot: the Duke dare No more stretch this finger of mine, then he Dare racke his owne: his Subiect am I not, Nor here Prouinciall: My businesse in this State Made me a looker on here in Vienna, Where I haue seene corruption boyle and bubble, Till it ore-run the Stew: Lawes, for all faults, But faults so countenanc'd, that the strong Statutes Stand like the forfeites in a Barbers shop, As much in mocke, as marke Slander to th' State: Away with him to prison What can you vouch against him Signior Lucio? Is this the man you did tell vs of? 'Tis he, my Lord: come hither goodman bald-pate, doe you know me? I remember you Sir, by the sound of your voice, I met you at the Prison, in the absence of the Duke Oh, did you so? and do you remember what you said of the Duke Most notedly Sir Do you so Sir: And was the Duke a flesh-monger, a foole, and a coward, as you then reported him to be? You must (Sir) change persons with me, ere you make that my report: you indeede spoke so of him, and much more, much worse Oh thou damnable fellow: did I not plucke thee by the nose, for thy speeches? I protest, I loue the Duke, as I loue my selfe Harke how the villaine would close now, after his treasonable abuses Such a fellow is not to be talk'd withall: Away with him to prison: Where is the Prouost? away with him to prison: lay bolts enough vpon him: let him speak no more: away with those Giglets too, and with the other confederate companion Stay Sir, stay a while What, resists he? helpe him Lucio Come sir, come sir, come sir: foh sir, why you bald-pated lying rascall: you must be hooded must you? show your knaues visage with a poxe to you: show your sheepe-biting face, and be hang'd an houre: Will't not off? Thou art the first knaue, that ere mad'st a Duke. First Prouost, let me bayle these gentle three: Sneake not away Sir, for the Fryer, and you, Must haue a word anon: lay hold on him This may proue worse then hanging What you haue spoke, I pardon: sit you downe, We'll borrow place of him; Sir, by your leaue: Ha'st thou or word, or wit, or impudence, That yet can doe thee office? If thou ha'st Rely vpon it, till my tale be heard, And hold no longer out Oh, my dread Lord, I should be guiltier then my guiltinesse, To thinke I can be vndiscerneable, When I perceiue your grace, like powre diuine, Hath look'd vpon my passes. Then good Prince, No longer Session hold vpon my shame, But let my Triall, be mine owne Confession: Immediate sentence then, and sequent death, Is all the grace I beg Come hither Mariana, Say: was't thou ere contracted to this woman? I was my Lord Goe take her hence, and marry her instantly. Doe you the office (Fryer) which consummate, Returne him here againe: goe with him Prouost. My Lord, I am more amaz'd at his dishonor, Then at the strangenesse of it Come hither Isabell, Your Frier is now your Prince: As I was then Aduertysing, and holy to your businesse, (Not changing heart with habit) I am still, Atturnied at your seruice Oh giue me pardon That I, your vassaile, haue imploid, and pain'd Your vnknowne Soueraigntie You are pardon'd Isabell: And now, deere Maide, be you as free to vs. Your Brothers death I know sits at your heart: And you may maruaile, why I obscur'd my selfe, Labouring to saue his life: and would not rather Make rash remonstrance of my hidden powre, Then let him so be lost: oh most kinde Maid, It was the swift celeritie of his death, Which I did thinke, with slower foot came on, That brain'd my purpose: but peace be with him, That life is better life past fearing death, Then that which liues to feare: make it your comfort, So happy is your Brother. I doe my Lord For this new-maried man, approaching here, Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd Your well defended honor: you must pardon For Mariana's sake: But as he adiudg'd your Brother, Being criminall, in double violation Of sacred Chastitie, and of promise-breach, Thereon dependant for your Brothers life, The very mercy of the Law cries out Most audible, euen from his proper tongue. An Angelo for Claudio, death for death: Haste still paies haste, and leasure, answers leasure; Like doth quit like, and Measure still for Measure: Then Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested; Which though thou would'st deny, denies thee vantage. We doe condemne thee to the very Blocke Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste. Away with him Oh my most gracious Lord, I hope you will not mocke me with a husband? It is your husband mock't you with a husband, Consenting to the safe-guard of your honor, I thought your marriage fit: else Imputation, For that he knew you, might reproach your life, And choake your good to come: For his Possessions, Although by confutation they are ours; We doe en-state, and widow you with all, To buy you a better husband Oh my deere Lord, I craue no other, nor no better man Neuer craue him, we are definitiue Gentle my Liege You doe but loose your labour. Away with him to death: Now Sir, to you Oh my good Lord, sweet Isabell, take my part, Lend me your knees, and all my life to come, I'll lend you all my life to doe you seruice Against all sence you doe importune her, Should she kneele downe, in mercie of this fact, Her Brothers ghost, his paued bed would breake, And take her hence in horror Isabell: Sweet Isabel, doe yet but kneele by me, Hold vp your hands, say nothing: I'll speake all. They say best men are moulded out of faults, And for the most, become much more the better For being a little bad: So may my husband. Oh Isabel: will you not lend a knee? He dies for Claudio's death Most bounteous Sir. Looke if it please you, on this man condemn'd, As if my Brother liu'd: I partly thinke, A due sinceritie gouerned his deedes, Till he did looke on me: Since it is so, Let him not die: my Brother had but Iustice, In that he did the thing for which he dide. For Angelo, his Act did not ore-take his bad intent, And must be buried but as an intent That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subiects Intents, but meerely thoughts Meerely my Lord Your suite's vnprofitable: stand vp I say: I haue bethought me of another fault. Prouost, how came it Claudio was beheaded At an vnusuall howre? It was commanded so Had you a speciall warrant for the deed? No my good Lord: it was by priuate message For which I doe discharge you of your office, Giue vp your keyes Pardon me, noble Lord, I thought it was a fault, but knew it not, Yet did repent me after more aduice, For testimony whereof, one in the prison That should by priuate order else haue dide, I haue reseru'd aliue What's he? His name is Barnardine I would thou hadst done so by Claudio: Goe fetch him hither, let me looke vpon him I am sorry, one so learned, and so wise As you, Lord Angelo, haue stil appear'd, Should slip so grosselie, both in the heat of bloud And lacke of temper'd iudgement afterward I am sorrie, that such sorrow I procure, And so deepe sticks it in my penitent heart, That I craue death more willingly then mercy, 'Tis my deseruing, and I doe entreat it. Which is that Barnardine? This my Lord There was a Friar told me of this man. Sirha, thou art said to haue a stubborne soule That apprehends no further then this world, And squar'st thy life according: Thou'rt condemn'd, But for those earthly faults, I quit them all, And pray thee take this mercie to prouide For better times to come: Frier aduise him, I leaue him to your hand. What muffeld fellow's that? This is another prisoner that I sau'd, Who should haue di'd when Claudio lost his head, As like almost to Claudio, as himselfe If he be like your brother, for his sake Is he pardon'd, and for your louelie sake Giue me your hand, and say you will be mine, He is my brother too: But fitter time for that: By this Lord Angelo perceiues he's safe, Methinkes I see a quickning in his eye: Well Angelo, your euill quits you well. Looke that you loue your wife: her worth, worth yours I finde an apt remission in my selfe: And yet heere's one in place I cannot pardon, You sirha, that knew me for a foole, a Coward, One all of Luxurie, an asse, a mad man: Wherein haue I so deseru'd of you That you extoll me thus? 'Faith my Lord, I spoke it but according to the trick: if you will hang me for it you may: but I had rather it would please you, I might be whipt Whipt first, sir, and hang'd after. Proclaime it Prouost round about the Citie, If any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow (As I haue heard him sweare himselfe there's one whom he begot with childe) let her appeare, And he shall marry her: the nuptiall finish'd, Let him be whipt and hang'd I beseech your Highnesse doe not marry me to a Whore: your Highnesse said euen now I made you a Duke, good my Lord do not recompence me, in making me a Cuckold Vpon mine honor thou shalt marrie her. Thy slanders I forgiue, and therewithall Remit thy other forfeits: take him to prison, And see our pleasure herein executed Marrying a punke my Lord, is pressing to death, Whipping and hanging Slandering a Prince deserues it. She Claudio that you wrong'd, looke you restore. Ioy to you Mariana, loue her Angelo: I haue confes'd her, and I know her vertue. Thanks good friend, Escalus, for thy much goodnesse, There's more behinde that is more gratulate. Thanks Prouost for thy care, and secrecie, We shall imploy thee in a worthier place. Forgiue him Angelo, that brought you home The head of Ragozine for Claudio's, Th' offence pardons it selfe. Deere Isabell, I haue a motion much imports your good, Whereto if you'll a willing eare incline; What's mine is yours, and what is yours is mine. So bring vs to our Pallace, where wee'll show What's yet behinde, that meete you all should know. The Scene Vienna. The names of all the Actors. Vincentio: the Duke. Angelo, the Deputie. Escalus, an ancient Lord. Claudio, a yong Gentleman. Lucio, a fantastique. 2. Other like Gentlemen. 2. Friers. Elbow, a simple Constable. Froth, a foolish Gentleman. Abhorson, an Executioner. Barnardine, a dissolute prisoner. Isabella, sister to Claudio. Mariana, betrothed to Angelo. Iuliet, beloued of Claudio. Francisca, a Nun. Mistris Ouer-don, a Bawd. Neuer tell me, I take it much vnkindly That thou (Iago) who hast had my purse, As if y strings were thine, should'st know of this But you'l not heare me. If euer I did dream Of such a matter, abhorre me Thou told'st me, Thou did'st hold him in thy hate Despise me If I do not. Three Great-ones of the Cittie, (In personall suite to make me his Lieutenant) Off-capt to him: and by the faith of man I know my price, I am worth no worsse a place. But he (as louing his owne pride, and purposes) Euades them, with a bumbast Circumstance, Horribly stufft with Epithites of warre, Non-suites my Mediators. For certes, saies he, I haue already chose my Officer. And what was he? For-sooth, a great Arithmatician, One Michaell Cassio, a Florentine, (A Fellow almost damn'd in a faire Wife) That neuer set a Squadron in the Field, Nor the deuision of a Battaile knowes More then a Spinster. Vnlesse the Bookish Theoricke: Wherein the Tongued Consuls can propose As Masterly as he. Meere pratle (without practise) Is all his Souldiership. But he (Sir) had th' election; And I (of whom his eies had seene the proofe At Rhodes, at Ciprus, and on others grounds Christen'd, and Heathen) must be be-leed, and calm'd By Debitor, and Creditor. This Counter-caster, He (in good time) must his Lieutenant be, And I (blesse the marke) his Mooreships Auntient By heauen, I rather would haue bin his hangman Why, there's no remedie. 'Tis the cursse of Seruice; Preferment goes by Letter, and affection, And not by old gradation, where each second Stood Heire to'th' first. Now Sir, be iudge your selfe, Whether I in any iust terme am Affin'd To loue the Moore? I would not follow him then O Sir content you. I follow him, to serue my turne vpon him. We cannot all be Masters, nor all Masters Cannot be truely follow'd. You shall marke Many a dutious and knee-crooking knaue; That (doting on his owne obsequious bondage) Weares out his time, much like his Masters Asse, For naught but Prouender, & when he's old Casheer'd. Whip me such honest knaues. Others there are Who trym'd in Formes, and visages of Dutie, Keepe yet their hearts attending on themselues, And throwing but showes of Seruice on their Lords Doe well thriue by them. And when they haue lin'd their Coates Doe themselues Homage. These Fellowes haue some soule, And such a one do I professe my selfe. For (Sir) It is as sure as you are Rodorigo, Were I the Moore, I would not be Iago: In following him, I follow but my selfe. Heauen is my Iudge, not I for loue and dutie, But seeming so, for my peculiar end: For when my outward Action doth demonstrate The natiue act, and figure of my heart In Complement externe, 'tis not long after But I will weare my heart vpon my sleeue For Dawes to pecke at; I am not what I am What a fall Fortune do's the Thicks-lips owe If he can carry't thus? Call vp her Father: Rowse him, make after him, poyson his delight, Proclaime him in the Streets. Incense her kinsmen, And though he in a fertile Clymate dwell, Plague him with Flies: though that his Ioy be Ioy, Yet throw such chances of vexation on't, As it may loose some colour Heere is her Fathers house, Ile call aloud Doe, with like timerous accent, and dire yell, As when (by Night and Negligence) the Fire Is spied in populus Citties What hoa: Brabantio, Signior Brabantio, hoa Awake: what hoa, Brabantio: Theeues, Theeues. Looke to your house, your daughter, and your Bags, Theeues, Theeues Aboue. What is the reason of this terrible Summons? What is the matter there? Signior is all your Familie within? Are your Doores lock'd? Why? Wherefore ask you this? Sir, y'are rob'd, for shame put on your Gowne, Your heart is burst, you haue lost halfe your soule Euen now, now, very now, an old blacke Ram Is tupping your white Ewe. Arise, arise, Awake the snorting Cittizens with the Bell, Or else the deuill will make a Grand-sire of you. Arise I say What, haue you lost your wits? Most reuerend Signior, do you know my voice? Not I: what are you? My name is Rodorigo The worsser welcome: I haue charg'd thee not to haunt about my doores: In honest plainenesse thou hast heard me say, My Daughter is not for thee. And now in madnesse (Being full of Supper, and distempring draughtes) Vpon malitious knauerie, dost thou come To start my quiet Sir, Sir, Sir But thou must needs be sure, My spirits and my place haue in their power To make this bitter to thee Patience good Sir What tell'st thou me of Robbing? This is Venice: my house is not a Grange Most graue Brabantio, In simple and pure soule, I come to you Sir: you are one of those that will not serue God, if the deuill bid you. Because we come to do you seruice, and you thinke we are Ruffians, you'le haue your Daughter couer'd with a Barbary horse, you'le haue your Nephewes neigh to you, you'le haue Coursers for Cozens: and Gennets for Germaines What prophane wretch art thou? I am one Sir, that comes to tell you, your Daughter and the Moore, are making the Beast with two backs Thou art a Villaine You are a Senator This thou shalt answere. I know thee Rodorigo Sir, I will answere any thing. But I beseech you If't be your pleasure, and most wise consent, (As partly I find it is) that your faire Daughter, At this odde Euen and dull watch o'th' night Transported with no worse nor better guard, But with a knaue of common hire, a Gundelier, To the grosse claspes of a Lasciuious Moore: If this be knowne to you, and your Allowance, We then haue done you bold, and saucie wrongs. But if you know not this, my Manners tell me, We haue your wrong rebuke. Do not beleeue That from the sence of all Ciuilitie, I thus would play and trifle with your Reuerence. Your Daughter (if you haue not giuen her leaue) I say againe, hath made a grosse reuolt, Tying her Dutie, Beautie, Wit, and Fortunes In an extrauagant, and wheeling Stranger, Of here, and euery where: straight satisfie your selfe. If she be in her Chamber, or your house, Let loose on me the Iustice of the State For thus deluding you Strike on the Tinder, hoa: Giue me a Taper: call vp all my people, This Accident is not vnlike my dreame, Beleefe of it oppresses me alreadie. Light, I say, light. Farewell: for I must leaue you. It seemes not meete, nor wholesome to my place To be producted, (as if I stay, I shall,) Against the Moore. For I do know the State, (How euer this may gall him with some checke) Cannot with safetie cast-him. For he's embark'd With such loud reason to the Cyprus Warres, (Which euen now stands in Act) that for their soules Another of his Fadome, they haue none, To lead their Businesse. In which regard, Though I do hate him as I do hell paines, Yet, for necessitie of present life, I must show out a Flag, and signe of Loue, (Which is indeed but signe) that you shal surely find him Lead to the Sagitary the raised Search: And there will I be with him. So farewell. It is too true an euill. Gone she is, And what's to come of my despised time, Is naught but bitternesse. Now Rodorigo, Where didst thou see her? (Oh vnhappie Girle) With the Moore saist thou? (Who would be a Father?) How didst thou know 'twas she? (Oh she deceaues me Past thought:) what said she to you? Get moe Tapers. Raise all my Kindred. Are they married thinke you? Truely I thinke they are Oh Heauen: how got she out? Oh treason of the blood. Fathers, from hence trust not your Daughters minds By what you see them act. Is there not Charmes, By which the propertie of Youth, and Maidhood May be abus'd? Haue you not read Rodorigo, Of some such thing? Yes Sir: I haue indeed Call vp my Brother: oh would you had had her. Some one way, some another. Doe you know Where we may apprehend her, and the Moore? I thinke I can discouer him, if you please To get good Guard, and go along with me Pray you lead on. At euery house Ile call, (I may command at most) get Weapons (hoa) And raise some speciall Officers of might: On good Rodorigo, I will deserue your paines. Scena Secunda. Though in the trade of Warre I haue slaine men, Yet do I hold it very stuffe o'th' conscience To do no contriu'd Murder: I lacke Iniquitie Sometime to do me seruice. Nine, or ten times I had thought t'haue yerk'd him here vnder the Ribbes 'Tis better as it is Nay but he prated, And spoke such scuruy, and prouoking termes Against your Honor, that with the little godlinesse I haue I did full hard forbeare him. But I pray you Sir, Are you fast married? Be assur'd of this, That the Magnifico is much belou'd, And hath in his effect a voice potentiall As double as the Dukes: He will diuorce you. Or put vpon you, what restraint or greeuance, The Law (with all his might, to enforce it on) Will giue him Cable Let him do his spight; My Seruices, which I haue done the Signorie Shall out-tongue his Complaints. 'Tis yet to know, Which when I know, that boasting is an Honour, I shall promulgate. I fetch my life and being, From Men of Royall Seige. And my demerites May speake (vnbonnetted) to as proud a Fortune As this that I haue reach'd. For know Iago, But that I loue the gentle Desdemona, I would not my vnhoused free condition Put into Circumscription, and Confine, For the Seas worth. But looke, what Lights come yond? Those are the raised Father, and his Friends: You were best go in Not I: I must be found. My Parts, my Title, and my perfect Soule Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they? By Ianus, I thinke no The Seruants of the Dukes? And my Lieutenant? The goodnesse of the Night vpon you (Friends) What is the Newes? The Duke do's greet you (Generall) And he requires your haste, Post-haste appearance, Euen on the instant What is the matter, thinke you? Something from Cyprus, as I may diuine: It is a businesse of some heate. The Gallies Haue sent a dozen sequent Messengers This very night, at one anothers heeles: And many of the Consuls, rais'd and met, Are at the Dukes already. You haue bin hotly call'd for, When being not at your Lodging to be found, The Senate hath sent about three seuerall Quests, To search you out 'Tis well I am found by you: I will but spend a word here in the house, And goe with you Aunciant, what makes he heere? Faith, he to night hath boarded a Land Carract, If it proue lawfull prize, he's made for euer I do not vnderstand He's married To who? Marry to- Come Captaine, will you go? Haue with you Here comes another Troope to seeke for you. It is Brabantio: Generall be aduis'd, He comes to bad intent Holla, stand there Signior, it is the Moore Downe with him, Theefe You, Rodorigo? Come Sir, I am for you Keepe vp your bright Swords, for the dew will rust them. Good Signior, you shall more command with yeares, then with your Weapons Oh thou foule Theefe, Where hast thou stow'd my Daughter? Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchaunted her For Ile referre me to all things of sense, (If she in Chaines of Magick were not bound) Whether a Maid, so tender, Faire, and Happie, So opposite to Marriage, that she shun'd The wealthy curled Deareling of our Nation, Would euer haue (t' encurre a generall mocke) Run from her Guardage to the sootie bosome, Of such a thing as thou: to feare, not to delight? Iudge me the world, if 'tis not grosse in sense, That thou hast practis'd on her with foule Charmes, Abus'd her delicate Youth, with Drugs or Minerals, That weakens Motion. Ile haue't disputed on, 'Tis probable, and palpable to thinking; I therefore apprehend and do attach thee, For an abuser of the World, a practiser Of Arts inhibited, and out of warrant; Lay hold vpon him, if he do resist Subdue him, at his perill Hold your hands Both you of my inclining, and the rest. Were it my Cue to fight, I should haue knowne it Without a Prompter. Whether will you that I goe To answere this your charge? To Prison, till fit time Of Law, and course of direct Session Call thee to answer What if I do obey? How may the Duke be therewith satisfi'd, Whose Messengers are heere about my side, Vpon some present businesse of the State, To bring me to him 'Tis true most worthy Signior, The Dukes in Counsell, and your Noble selfe, I am sure is sent for How? The Duke in Counsell? In this time of the night? Bring him away; Mine's not an idle Cause. The Duke himselfe, Or any of my Brothers of the State, Cannot but feele this wrong, as 'twere their owne: For if such Actions may haue passage free, Bond-slaues, and Pagans shall our Statesmen be. Scaena Tertia. There's no composition in this Newes, That giues them Credite 1.Sen. Indeed, they are disproportioned; My Letters say, a Hundred and seuen Gallies And mine a Hundred fortie 2.Sena. And mine two Hundred: But though they iumpe not on a iust accompt, (As in these Cases where the ayme reports, 'Tis oft with difference) yet do they all confirme A Turkish Fleete, and bearing vp to Cyprus Nay, it is possible enough to iudgement: I do not so secure me in the Error, But the maine Article I do approue In fearefull sense Saylor within. What hoa, what hoa, what hoa. A Messenger from the Gallies Now? What's the businesse? The Turkish Preparation makes for Rhodes, So was I bid report here to the State, By Signior Angelo How say you by this change? 1.Sen. This cannot be By no assay of reason. 'Tis a Pageant To keepe vs in false gaze, when we consider Th' importancie of Cyprus to the Turke; And let our selues againe but vnderstand, That as it more concernes the Turke then Rhodes, So may he with more facile question beare it, For that it stands not in such Warrelike brace, But altogether lackes th' abilities That Rhodes is dress'd in. If we make thought of this, We must not thinke the Turke is so vnskillfull, To leaue that latest, which concernes him first, Neglecting an attempt of ease, and gaine To wake, and wage a danger profitlesse Nay, in all confidence he's not for Rhodes Here is more Newes. The Ottamites, Reueren'd, and Gracious, Steering with due course toward the Ile of Rhodes, Haue there inioynted them with an after Fleete 1.Sen. I, so I thought: how many, as you guesse? Of thirtie Saile: and now they do re-stem Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano, Your trustie and most Valiant Seruitour, With his free dutie, recommends you thus, And prayes you to beleeue him 'Tis certaine then for Cyprus: Marcus Luccicos is not he in Towne? 1.Sen. He's now in Florence Write from vs, To him, Post, Post-haste, dispatch 1.Sen. Here comes Brabantio, and the Valiant Moore. Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you, Against the generall Enemy Ottoman. I did not see you: welcome gentle Signior, We lack't your Counsaile, and your helpe to night So did I yours: Good your Grace pardon me. Neither my place, nor ought I heard of businesse Hath rais'd me from my bed; nor doth the generall care Take hold on me. For my perticular griefe Is of so flood-gate, and ore-bearing Nature, That it engluts, and swallowes other sorrowes, And it is still it selfe Why? What's the matter? My Daughter: oh my Daughter! Dead? I, to me. She is abus'd, stolne from me, and corrupted By Spels, and Medicines, bought of Mountebanks; For Nature, so prepostrously to erre, (Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,) Sans witch-craft could not Who ere he be, that in this foule proceeding Hath thus beguil'd your Daughter of her selfe, And you of her; the bloodie Booke of Law, You shall your selfe read, in the bitter letter, After your owne sense: yea, though our proper Son Stood in your Action Humbly I thanke your Grace, Here is the man; this Moore, whom now it seemes Your speciall Mandate, for the State affaires Hath hither brought We are verie sorry for't What in your owne part, can you say to this? Nothing, but this is so Most Potent, Graue, and Reueren'd Signiors, My very Noble, and approu'd good Masters; That I haue tane away this old mans Daughter, It is most true: true I haue married her; The verie head, and front of my offending, Hath this extent; no more. Rude am I, in my speech, And little bless'd with the soft phrase of Peace; For since these Armes of mine, had seuen yeares pith, Till now, some nine Moones wasted, they haue vs'd Their deerest action, in the Tented Field: And little of this great world can I speake, More then pertaines to Feats of Broiles, and Battaile, And therefore little shall I grace my cause, In speaking for my selfe. Yet, (by your gratious patience) I will a round vn-varnish'd Tale deliuer, Of my whole course of Loue. What Drugges, what Charmes, What Coniuration, and what mighty Magicke, (For such proceeding I am charg'd withall) I won his Daughter A Maiden, neuer bold: Of Spirit so still, and quiet, that her Motion Blush'd at her selfe, and she, in spight of Nature, Of Yeares, of Country, Credite, euery thing To fall in Loue, with what she fear'd to looke on; It is a iudgement main'd, and most imperfect. That will confesse Perfection so could erre Against all rules of Nature, and must be driuen To find out practises of cunning hell Why this should be. I therefore vouch againe, That with some Mixtures, powrefull o're the blood, Or with some Dram, (coniur'd to this effect) He wrought vpon her. To vouch this, is no proofe, Without more wider, and more ouer Test Then these thin habits, and poore likely-hoods Of moderne seeming, do prefer against him But Othello, speake, Did you, by indirect, and forced courses Subdue, and poyson this yong Maides affections? Or came it by request, and such faire question As soule, to soule affordeth? I do beseech you, Send for the Lady to the Sagitary, And let her speake of me before her Father; If you do finde me foule, in her report, The Trust, the Office, I do hold of you, Not onely take away, but let your Sentence Euen fall vpon my life Fetch Desdemona hither Aunciant, conduct them: You best know the place. And tell she come, as truely as to heauen, I do confesse the vices of my blood, So iustly to your Graue eares, Ile present How I did thriue in this faire Ladies loue, And she in mine Say it Othello Her Father lou'd me, oft inuited me: Still question'd me the Storie of my life, From yeare to yeare: the Battaile, Sieges, Fortune, That I haue past. I ran it through, euen from my boyish daies, Toth' very moment that he bad me tell it. Wherein I spoke of most disastrous chances: Of mouing Accidents by Flood and Field, Of haire-breadth scapes i'th' imminent deadly breach; Of being taken by the Insolent Foe, And sold to slauery. Of my redemption thence, And portance in my Trauellours historie. Wherein of Antars vast, and Desarts idle, Rough Quarries, Rocks, Hills, whose head touch heauen, It was my hint to speake. Such was my Processe, And of the Canibals that each others eate, The Antropophague, and men whose heads Grew beneath their shoulders. These things to heare, Would Desdemona seriously incline: But still the house Affaires would draw her hence: Which euer as she could with haste dispatch, She'l'd come againe, and with a greedie eare Deuoure vp my discourse. Which I obseruing, Tooke once a pliant houre, and found good meanes To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart, That I would all my Pilgrimage dilate, Whereof by parcels she had something heard, But not instinctiuely: I did consent, And often did beguile her of her teares, When I did speake of some distressefull stroke That my youth suffer'd: My Storie being done, She gaue me for my paines a world of kisses: She swore in faith 'twas strange: 'twas passing strange, 'Twas pittifull: 'twas wondrous pittifull. She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd That Heauen had made her such a man. She thank'd me, And bad me, if I had a Friend that lou'd her, I should but teach him how to tell my Story, And that would wooe her. Vpon this hint I spake, She lou'd me for the dangers I had past, And I lou'd her, that she did pitty them. This onely is the witch-craft I haue vs'd. Here comes the Ladie: Let her witnesse it. I thinke this tale would win my Daughter too, Good Brabantio, take vp this mangled matter at the best: Men do their broken Weapons rather vse, Then their bare hands I pray you heare her speake? If she confesse that she was halfe the wooer, Destruction on my head, if my bad blame Light on the man. Come hither gentle Mistris, Do you perceiue in all this Noble Companie, Where most you owe obedience? My Noble Father, I do perceiue heere a diuided dutie. To you I am bound for life, and education: My life and education both do learne me, How to respect you. You are the Lord of duty, I am hitherto your Daughter. But heere's my Husband; And so much dutie, as my Mother shew'd To you, preferring you before her Father: So much I challenge, that I may professe Due to the Moore my Lord God be with you: I haue done. Please it your Grace, on to the State Affaires; I had rather to adopt a Child, then get it. Come hither Moore; I here do giue thee that with all my heart, Which but thou hast already, with all my heart I would keepe from thee. For your sake (Iewell) I am glad at soule, I haue no other Child, For thy escape would teach me Tirranie To hang clogges on them. I haue done my Lord Let me speake like your selfe: And lay a Sentence, Which as a grise, or step may helpe these Louers. When remedies are past, the griefes are ended By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended. To mourne a Mischeefe that is past and gon, Is the next way to draw new mischiefe on. What cannot be preseru'd, when Fortune takes: Patience, her Iniury a mock'ry makes. The rob'd that smiles, steales something from the Thiefe, He robs himselfe, that spends a bootelesse griefe So let the Turke of Cyprus vs beguile, We loose it not so long as we can smile: He beares the Sentence well, that nothing beares, But the free comfort which from thence he heares. But he beares both the Sentence, and the sorrow, That to pay griefe, must of poore Patience borrow. These Sentences, to Sugar, or to Gall, Being strong on both sides, are Equiuocall. But words are words, I neuer yet did heare: That the bruized heart was pierc'd through the eares. I humbly beseech you proceed to th' Affaires of State The Turke with a most mighty Preparation makes for Cyprus: Othello, the Fortitude of the place is best knowne to you. And though we haue there a Substitute of most allowed sufficiencie; yet opinion, a more soueraigne Mistris of Effects, throwes a more safer voice on you: you must therefore be content to slubber the glosse of your new Fortunes, with this more stubborne, and boystrous expedition The Tirant Custome, most Graue Senators, Hath made the flinty and Steele Coach of Warre My thrice-driuen bed of Downe. I do agnize A Naturall and prompt Alacratie, I finde in hardnesse: and do vndertake This present Warres against the Ottamites. Most humbly therefore bending to your State, I craue fit disposition for my Wife, Due reference of Place, and Exhibition, With such Accomodation and besort As leuels with her breeding Why at her Fathers? I will not haue it so Nor I Nor would I there recide, To put my Father in impatient thoughts By being in his eye. Most Gracious Duke, To my vnfolding, lend your prosperous eare, And let me finde a Charter in your voice T' assist my simplenesse What would you Desdemona? That I loue the Moore, to liue with him, My downe-right violence, and storme of Fortunes, May trumpet to the world. My heart's subdu'd Euen to the very quality of my Lord; I saw Othello's visage in his mind, And to his Honours and his valiant parts, Did I my soule and Fortunes consecrate. So that (deere Lords) if I be left behind A Moth of Peace, and he go to the Warre, The Rites for why I loue him, are bereft me: And I a heauie interim shall support By his deere absence. Let me go with him Let her haue your voice. Vouch with me Heauen, I therefore beg it not To please the pallate of my Appetite: Nor to comply with heat the yong affects In my defunct, and proper satisfaction. But to be free, and bounteous to her minde: And Heauen defend your good soules, that you thinke I will your serious and great businesse scant When she is with me. No, when light wing'd Toyes Of feather'd Cupid, seele with wanton dulnesse My speculatiue, and offic'd Instrument: That my Disports corrupt, and taint my businesse: Let House-wiues make a Skillet of my Helme, And all indigne, and base aduersities, Make head against my Estimation Be it as you shall priuately determine, Either for her stay, or going: th' Affaire cries hast: And speed must answer it You must away to night With all my heart At nine i'th' morning, here wee'l meete againe. Othello, leaue some Officer behind And he shall our Commission bring to you: And such things else of qualitie and respect As doth import you So please your Grace, my Ancient, A man he is of honesty and trust: To his conueyance I assigne my wife, With what else needfull, your good Grace shall think To be sent after me Let it be so: Good night to euery one. And Noble Signior, If Vertue no delighted Beautie lacke, Your Son-in-law is farre more Faire then Blacke Adieu braue Moore, vse Desdemona well Looke to her (Moore) if thou hast eies to see: She ha's deceiu'd her Father, and may thee. My life vpon her faith. Honest Iago, My Desdemona must I leaue to thee: I prythee let thy wife attend on her, And bring them after in the best aduantage. Come Desdemona, I haue but an houre Of Loue, of wordly matter, and direction To spend with thee. We must obey the time. Iago What saist thou Noble heart? What will I do, think'st thou? Why go to bed and sleepe I will incontinently drowne my selfe If thou do'st, I shall neuer loue thee after. Why thou silly Gentleman? It is sillynesse to liue, when to liue is torment: and then haue we a prescription to dye, when death is our Physition Oh villanous: I haue look'd vpon the world for foure times seuen yeares, and since I could distinguish betwixt a Benefit, and an Iniurie: I neuer found man that knew how to loue himselfe. Ere I would say, I would drowne my selfe for the loue of a Gynney Hen, I would change my Humanity with a Baboone What should I do? I confesse it is my shame to be so fond, but it is not in my vertue to amend it Vertue? A figge, 'tis in our selues that we are thus, or thus. Our Bodies are our Gardens, to the which, our Wills are Gardiners. So that if we will plant Nettels, or sowe Lettice: Set Hisope, and weede vp Time: Supplie it with one gender of Hearbes, or distract it with many: either to haue it sterrill with idlenesse, or manured with Industry, why the power, and Corrigeable authoritie of this lies in our Wills. If the braine of our liues had not one Scale of Reason, to poize another of Sensualitie, the blood, and basenesse of our Natures would conduct vs to most prepostrous Conclusions. But we haue Reason to coole our raging Motions, our carnall Stings, or vnbitted Lusts: whereof I take this, that you call Loue, to be a Sect, or Seyen It cannot be It is meerly a Lust of the blood, and a permission of the will. Come, be a man: drowne thy selfe? Drown Cats, and blind Puppies. I haue profest me thy Friend, and I confesse me knit to thy deseruing, with Cables of perdurable toughnesse. I could neuer better steed thee then now. Put Money in thy purse: follow thou the Warres, defeate thy fauour, with an vsurp'd Beard. I say put Money in thy purse. It cannot be long that Desdemona should continue her loue to the Moore. Put Money in thy purse: nor he his to her. It was a violent Commencement in her, and thou shalt see an answerable Sequestration, put but Money in thy purse. These Moores are changeable in their wils: fill thy purse with Money. The Food that to him now is as lushious as Locusts, shalbe to him shortly, as bitter as Coloquintida. She must change for youth: when she is sated with his body she will find the errors of her choice. Therefore, put Money in thy purse. If thou wilt needs damne thy selfe, do it a more delicate way then drowning. Make all the Money thou canst: If Sanctimonie, and a fraile vow, betwixt an erring Barbarian, and super-subtle Venetian be not too hard for my wits, and all the Tribe of hell, thou shalt enioy her: therefore make Money: a pox of drowning thy selfe, it is cleane out of the way. Seeke thou rather to be hang'd in Compassing thy ioy, then to be drown'd, and go without her Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on the issue? Thou art sure of me: Go make Money: I haue told thee often, and I re-tell thee againe, and againe, I hate the Moore. My cause is hearted; thine hath no lesse reason. Let vs be coniunctiue in our reuenge, against him. If thou canst Cuckold him, thou dost thy selfe a pleasure, me a sport. There are many Euents in the Wombe of Time, which wilbe deliuered. Trauerse, go, prouide thy Money. We will haue more of this to morrow. Adieu Where shall we meete i'th' morning? At my Lodging Ile be with thee betimes Go too, farewell. Do you heare Rodorigo? Ile sell all my Land. Thus do I euer make my Foole, my purse: For I mine owne gain'd knowledge should prophane If I would time expend with such Snipe, But for my Sport, and Profit: I hate the Moore, And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets She ha's done my Office. I know not if't be true, But I, for meere suspition in that kinde, Will do, as if for Surety. He holds me well, The better shall my purpose worke on him: Cassio's a proper man: Let me see now, To get his Place, and to plume vp my will In double Knauery. How? How? Let's see. After some time, to abuse Othello's eares, That he is too familiar with his wife: He hath a person, and a smooth dispose To be suspected: fram'd to make women false. The Moore is of a free, and open Nature, That thinkes men honest, that but seeme to be so, And will as tenderly be lead by'th' Nose As Asses are: I hau't: it is engendred: Hell, and Night, Must bring this monstrous Birth, to the worlds light. What from the Cape, can you discerne at Sea? 1.Gent. Nothing at all, it is a high wrought Flood: I cannot 'twixt the Heauen, and the Maine, Descry a Saile Me thinks, the wind hath spoke aloud at Land, A fuller blast ne're shooke our Battlements: If it hath ruffiand so vpon the Sea, What ribbes of Oake, when Mountaines melt on them, Can hold the Morties. What shall we heare of this? 2 A Segregation of the Turkish Fleet: For do but stand vpon the Foaming Shore, The chidden Billow seemes to pelt the Clowds, The winde-shak'd-Surge, with high & monstrous Maine Seemes to cast water on the burning Beare, And quench the Guards of th' euer-fixed Pole: I neuer did like mollestation view On the enchafed Flood If that the Turkish Fleete Be not enshelter'd, and embay'd, they are drown'd, It is impossible to beare it out. 3 Newes Laddes: our warres are done: The desperate Tempest hath so bang'd the Turkes, That their designement halts. A Noble ship of Venice, Hath seene a greeuous wracke and sufferance On most part of their Fleet How? Is this true? 3 The Ship is heere put in: A Verennessa, Michael Cassio Lieutenant to the warlike Moore, Othello, Is come on Shore: the Moore himselfe at Sea, And is in full Commission heere for Cyprus I am glad on't: 'Tis a worthy Gouernour 3 But this same Cassio, though he speake of comfort, Touching the Turkish losse, yet he lookes sadly, And praye the Moore be safe; for they were parted With fowle and violent Tempest Pray Heauens he be: For I haue seru'd him, and the man commands Like a full Soldier. Let's to the Sea-side (hoa) As well to see the Vessell that's come in, As to throw-out our eyes for braue Othello, Euen till we make the Maine, and th' Eriall blew, An indistinct regard Come, let's do so; For euery Minute is expectancie Of more Arriuancie. Thankes you, the valiant of the warlike Isle, That so approoue the Moore: Oh let the Heauens Giue him defence against the Elements, For I haue lost him on a dangerous Sea Is he well ship'd? His Barke is stoutly Timber'd, and his Pylot Of verie expert, and approu'd Allowance; Therefore my hope's (not surfetted to death) Stand in bold Cure What noise? The Towne is empty; on the brow o'th' Sea Stand rankes of People and they cry, a Saile My hopes do shape him for the Gouernor They do discharge their Shot of Courtesie, Our Friends, at least I pray you Sir, go forth, And giue vs truth who 'tis that is arriu'd I shall. But good Lieutenant, is your Generall wiu'd? Most fortunately: he hath atchieu'd a Maid That paragons description, and wilde Fame: One that excels the quirkes of Blazoning pens, And in th' essentiall Vesture of Creation, Do's tyre the Ingeniuer. How now? Who ha's put in? 'Tis one Iago, Auncient to the Generall Ha's had most fauourable, and happie speed: Tempests themselues, high Seas, and howling windes, The gutter'd-Rockes, and Congregated Sands, Traitors ensteep'd, to enclogge the guiltlesse Keele, As hauing sence of Beautie, do omit Their mortall Natures, letting go safely by The Diuine Desdemona What is she? She that I spake of: Our great Captains Captaine, Left in the conduct of the bold Iago, Whose footing heere anticipates our thoughts, A Senights speed. Great Ioue, Othello guard, And swell his Saile with thine owne powrefull breath, That he may blesse this Bay with his tall Ship, Make loues quicke pants in Desdemonaes Armes, Giue renew'd fire to our extincted Spirits. Oh behold, The Riches of the Ship is come on shore: You men of Cyprus, let her haue your knees. Haile to thee Ladie: and the grace of Heauen, Before, behinde thee, and on euery hand Enwheele thee round I thanke you, Valiant Cassio, What tydings can you tell of my Lord? He is not yet arriu'd, nor know I ought But that he's well, and will be shortly heere Oh, but I feare: How lost you company? The great Contention of Sea, and Skies Parted our fellowship. But hearke, a Saile They giue this greeting to the Cittadell: This likewise is a Friend See for the Newes: Good Ancient, you are welcome. Welcome Mistris: Let it not gaule your patience (good Iago) That I extend my Manners. 'Tis my breeding, That giues me this bold shew of Curtesie Sir, would she giue you so much of her lippes, As of her tongue she oft bestowes on me, You would haue enough Alas: she ha's no speech Infaith too much: I finde it still, when I haue leaue to sleepe. Marry before your Ladyship, I grant, She puts her tongue a little in her heart, And chides with thinking aemil. You haue little cause to say so Come on, come on: you are Pictures out of doore: Bells in your Parlours: Wilde-Cats in your Kitchens: Saints in your Iniuries: Diuels being offended: Players in your Huswiferie, and Huswiues in your Beds Oh, fie vpon thee, Slanderer Nay, it is true: or else I am a Turke, You rise to play, and go to bed to worke. You shall not write my praise No, let me not What would'st write of me, if thou should'st praise me? Oh, gentle Lady, do not put me too't, For I am nothing, if not Criticall Come on, assay. There's one gone to the Harbour? I Madam I am not merry: but I do beguile The thing I am, by seeming otherwise. Come, how would'st thou praise me? I am about it, but indeed my inuention comes from my pate, as Birdlyme do's from Freeze, it pluckes out Braines and all. But my Muse labours, and thus she is deliuer'd. If she be faire, and wise: fairenesse, and wit, The ones for vse, the other vseth it Well prais'd: How if she be Blacke and Witty? If she be blacke, and thereto haue a wit, She'le find a white, that shall her blacknesse fit Worse, and worse. How if Faire, and Foolish? She neuer yet was foolish that was faire, For euen her folly helpt her to an heire These are old fond Paradoxes, to make Fooles laugh i'th' Alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for her that's Foule, and Foolish There's none so foule and foolish thereunto, But do's foule pranks, which faire, and wise-ones do Oh heauy ignorance: thou praisest the worst best. But what praise could'st thou bestow on a deseruing woman indeed? One, that in the authorithy of her merit, did iustly put on the vouch of very malice it selfe She that was euer faire, and neuer proud, Had Tongue at will, and yet was neuer loud: Neuer lackt Gold, and yet went neuer gay, Fled from her wish, and yet said now I may. She that being angred, her reuenge being nie, Bad her wrong stay, and her displeasure flie: She that in wisedome neuer was so fraile, To change the Cods-head for the Salmons taile: She that could thinke, and neu'r disclose her mind, See Suitors following, and not looke behind: She was a wight, (if euer such wightes were) To do what? To suckle Fooles, and chronicle small Beere Oh most lame and impotent conclusion. Do not learne of him aemillia, though he be thy husband. How say you (Cassio) is he not a most prophane, and liberall Counsailor? He speakes home (Madam) you may rellish him more in the Souldier, then in the Scholler He takes her by the palme: I, well said, whisper. With as little a web as this, will I ensnare as great a Fly as Cassio. I smile vpon her, do: I will giue thee in thine owne Courtship. You say true, 'tis so indeed. If such tricks as these strip you out of your Lieutenantrie, it had beene better you had not kiss'd your three fingers so oft, which now againe you are most apt to play the Sir, in. Very good: well kiss'd, and excellent Curtsie: 'tis so indeed. Yet againe, your fingers to your lippes? Would they were Cluster-pipes for your sake. The Moore I know his Trumpet 'Tis truely so Let's meete him, and recieue him Loe, where he comes. O, my faire Warriour My deere Othello It giues me wonder great, as my content To see you heere before me. Oh my Soules Ioy: If after euery Tempest, come such Calmes, May the windes blow, till they haue waken'd death: And let the labouring Barke climbe hills of Seas Olympus high: and duck againe as low, As hell's from Heauen. If it were now to dye, 'Twere now to be most happy. For I feare, My Soule hath her content so absolute, That not another comfort like to this, Succeedes in vnknowne Fate The Heauens forbid But that our Loues And Comforts should encrease Euen as our dayes do grow Amen to that (sweet Powers) I cannot speake enough of this content, It stoppes me heere: it is too much of ioy. And this, and this the greatest discords be That ere our hearts shall make Oh you are well tun'd now: But Ile set downe the peggs that make this Musicke, as honest as I am Come: let vs to the Castle. Newes (Friends) our Warres are done: The Turkes are drown'd. How do's my old Acquaintance of this Isle? (Hony) you shall be well desir'd in Cyprus, I haue found great loue among'st them. Oh my Sweet, I prattle out of fashion, and I doate In mine owne comforts. I prythee, good Iago, Go to the Bay, and disimbarke my Coffers: Bring thou the Master to the Cittadell, He is a good one, and his worthynesse Do's challenge much respect. Come Desdemona, Once more well met at Cyprus. Do thou meet me presently at the Harbour. Come thither, if thou be'st Valiant, (as they say base men being in Loue, haue then a Nobilitie in their Natures, more then is natiue to them) list-me; the Lieutenant to night watches on the Court of Guard. First, I must tell thee this: Desdemona, is directly in loue with him With him? Why, 'tis not possible Lay thy finger thus: and let thy soule be instructed. Marke me with what violence she first lou'd the Moore, but for bragging, and telling her fantasticall lies. To loue him still for prating, let not thy discreet heart thinke it. Her eye must be fed. And what delight shall she haue to looke on the diuell? When the Blood is made dull with the Act of Sport, there should be a game to enflame it, and to giue Satiety a fresh appetite. Louelinesse in fauour, simpathy in yeares, Manners, and Beauties: all which the Moore is defectiue in. Now for want of these requir'd Conueniences, her delicate tendernesse wil finde it selfe abus'd, begin to heaue the, gorge, disrellish and abhorre the Moore, very Nature wil instruct her in it, and compell her to some second choice. Now Sir, this granted (as it is a most pregnant and vnforc'd position) who stands so eminent in the degree of this Fortune, as Cassio do's: a knaue very voluble: no further conscionable, then in putting on the meere forme of Ciuill, and Humaine seeming, for the better compasse of his salt, and most hidden loose Affection? Why none, why none: A slipper, and subtle knaue, a finder of occasion: that he's an eye can stampe, and counterfeit Aduantages, though true Aduantage neuer present it selfe. A diuelish knaue: besides, the knaue is handsome, young: and hath all those requisites in him, that folly and greene mindes looke after. A pestilent compleat knaue, and the woman hath found him already I cannot beleeue that in her, she's full of most bless'd condition Bless'd figges-end. The Wine she drinkes is made of grapes. If shee had beene bless'd, shee would neuer haue lou'd the Moore: Bless'd pudding. Didst thou not see her paddle with the palme of his hand? Didst not marke that? Yes, that I did: but that was but curtesie Iago . Leacherie by this hand: an Index, and obscure prologue to the History of Lust and foule Thoughts. They met so neere with their lippes, that their breathes embrac'd together. Villanous thoughts Rodorigo, when these mutabilities so marshall the way, hard at hand comes the Master, and maine exercise, th' incorporate conclusion: Pish. But Sir, be you rul'd by me. I haue brought you from Venice. Watch you to night: for the Command, Ile lay't vpon you. Cassio knowes you not: Ile not be farre from you. Do you finde some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking too loud, or tainting his discipline, or from what other course you please, which the time shall more fauorably minister Well Sir, he's rash, and very sodaine in Choller: and happely may strike at you, prouoke him that he may: for euen out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to Mutiny. Whose qualification shall come into no true taste againe, but by the displanting of Cassio. So shall you haue a shorter iourney to your desires, by the meanes I shall then haue to preferre them. And the impediment most profitably remoued, without the which there were no expectation of our prosperitie I will do this, if you can bring it to any opportunity I warrant thee. Meete me by and by at the I must fetch his Necessaries a Shore. Farewell Adieu. That Cassio loues her, I do well beleeu't: That she loues him, 'tis apt, and of great Credite. The Moore (howbeit that I endure him not) Is of a constant, louing, Noble Nature, And I dare thinke, he'le proue to Desdemona A most deere husband. Now I do loue her too, Not out of absolute Lust, (though peraduenture I stand accomptant for as great a sin) But partely led to dyet my Reuenge, For that I do suspect the lustie Moore Hath leap'd into my Seate. The thought whereof, Doth (like a poysonous Minerall) gnaw my Inwardes: And nothing can, or shall content my Soule Till I am eeuen'd with him, wife, for wife. Or fayling so, yet that I put the Moore, At least into a Ielouzie so strong That iudgement cannot cure. Which thing to do, If this poore Trash of Venice, whom I trace For his quicke hunting, stand the putting on, Ile haue our Michael Cassio on the hip, Abuse him to the Moore, in the right garbe (For I feare Cassio with my Night-Cape too) Make the Moore thanke me, loue me, and reward me, For making him egregiously an Asse, And practising vpon his peace, and quiet, Euen to madnesse. 'Tis heere: but yet confus'd, Knaueries plaine face, is neuer seene, till vs'd. Scena Secunda. It is Othello's pleasure, our Noble and Valiant That vpon certaine tydings now arriu'd, importing the meere perdition of the Turkish Fleete: euery man put himselfe into Triumph. Some to daunce, some to make Bonfires, each man, to what Sport and Reuels his addition leads him. For besides these beneficiall Newes, it is the Celebration of his Nuptiall. So much was his pleasure should be proclaimed. All offices are open, & there is full libertie of Feasting from this present houre of fiue, till the Bell haue told eleuen. Blesse the Isle of Cyprus, and our Noble Generall Othello. Good Michael, looke you to the guard to night. Let's teach our selues that Honourable stop, Not to out-sport discretion Iago, hath direction what to do. But notwithstanding with my personall eye Will I looke to't Iago, is most honest: Michael, goodnight. To morrow with your earliest, Let me haue speech with you. Come my deere Loue, The purchase made, the fruites are to ensue, That profit's yet to come 'tweene me, and you. Welcome Iago: we must to the Watch Not this houre Lieutenant: 'tis not yet ten o'th' clocke. Our Generall cast vs thus earely for the loue of his Desdemona: Who, let vs not therefore blame; he hath not yet made wanton the night with her: and she is sport for Ioue She's a most exquisite Lady And Ile warrant her, full of Game Indeed shes a most fresh and delicate creature What an eye she ha's? Me thinkes it sounds a parley to prouocation An inuiting eye: And yet me thinkes right modest And when she speakes, Is it not an Alarum to Loue? She is indeed perfection Well: happinesse to their Sheetes. Come Lieutenant, I haue a stope of Wine, and heere without are a brace of Cyprus Gallants, that would faine haue a measure to the health of blacke Othello Not to night, good Iago, I haue very poore, and vnhappie Braines for drinking. I could well wish Curtesie would inuent some other Custome of entertainment Oh, they are our Friends: but one Cup, Ile drinke for you I haue drunke but one Cup to night, and that was craftily qualified too: and behold what inouation it makes heere. I am infortunate in the infirmity, and dare not taske my weakenesse with any more What man? 'Tis a night of Reuels, the Gallants desire it Where are they? Heere, at the doore: I pray you call them in Ile do't, but it dislikes me. If I can fasten but one Cup vpon him With that which he hath drunke to night alreadie, He'l be as full of Quarrell, and offence As my yong Mistris dogge. Now my sicke Foole Rodorigo, Whom Loue hath turn'd almost the wrong side out, To Desdemona hath to night Carrows'd. Potations, pottle-deepe; and he's to watch. Three else of Cyprus, Noble swelling Spirites, (That hold their Honours in a wary distance, The very Elements of this Warrelike Isle) Haue I to night fluster'd with flowing Cups, And they Watch too. Now 'mongst this Flocke of drunkards Am I put to our Cassio in some Action That may offend the Isle. But here they come. If Consequence do but approue my dreame, My Boate sailes freely, both with winde and Streame 'Fore heauen, they haue giuen me a rowse already Good-faith a litle one: not past a pint, as I am a Souldier Some Wine hoa. And let me the Cannakin clinke, clinke: And let me the Cannakin clinke. A Souldiers a man: Oh, mans life's but a span, Why then let a Souldier drinke. Some Wine Boyes 'Fore Heauen: an excellent Song I learn'd it in England: where indeed they are most potent in Potting. Your Dane, your Germaine, and your swag-belly'd Hollander, (drinke hoa) are nothing to your English Is your Englishmen so exquisite in his drinking? Why, he drinkes you with facillitie, your Dane dead drunke. He sweates not to ouerthrow your Almaine. He giues your Hollander a vomit, ere the next Pottle can be fill'd To the health of our Generall I am for it Lieutenant: and Ile do you Iustice Oh sweet England. King Stephen was anda worthy Peere, His Breeches cost him but a Crowne, He held them Six pence all to deere, With that he cal'd the Tailor Lowne: He was a wight of high Renowne, And thou art but of low degree: 'Tis Pride that pulls the Country downe, And take thy awl'd Cloake about thee. Some Wine hoa Why this is a more exquisite Song then the other Will you heare't againe? No: for I hold him to be vnworthy of his Place, that do's those things. Well: heau'ns aboue all: and there be soules must be saued, and there be soules must not be saued It's true, good Lieutenant For mine owne part, no offence to the Generall, nor any man of qualitie: I hope to be saued And so do I too Lieutenant I: (but by your leaue) not before me. The Lieutenant is to be saued before the Ancient. Let's haue no more of this: let's to our Affaires. Forgiue vs our sinnes: Gentlemen let's looke to our businesse. Do not thinke Gentlemen, I am drunke: this is my Ancient, this is my right hand, and this is my left. I am not drunke now: I can stand well enough, and I speake well enough Excellent well Why very well then: you must not thinke then, that I am drunke. To th' Platforme (Masters) come, let's set the Watch You see this Fellow, that is gone before, He's a Souldier, fit to stand by Caesar, And giue direction. And do but see his vice, 'Tis to his vertue, a iust Equinox, The one as long as th' other. 'Tis pittie of him: I feare the trust Othello puts him in, On some odde time of his infirmitie Will shake this Island But is he often thus? 'Tis euermore his prologue to his sleepe, He'le watch the Horologe a double Set, If Drinke rocke not his Cradle It were well The Generall were put in mind of it: Perhaps he sees it not, or his good nature Prizes the vertue that appeares in Cassio, And lookes not on his euills: is not this true? How now Rodorigo? I pray you after the Lieutenant, go And 'tis great pitty, that the Noble Moore Should hazard such a Place, as his owne Second With one of an ingraft Infirmitie, It were an honest Action, to say so To the Moore Not I, for this faire Island, I do loue Cassio well: and would do much To cure him of this euill, But hearke, what noise? You Rogue: you Rascall What's the matter Lieutenant? A Knaue teach me my dutie? Ile beate the Knaue in to a Twiggen-Bottle Beate me? Dost thou prate, Rogue? Nay, good Lieutenant: I pray you Sir, hold your hand Let me go (Sir) Or Ile knocke you o're the Mazard Come, come: you're drunke Drunke? Away I say: go out and cry a Mutinie. Nay good Lieutenant. Alas Gentlemen: Helpe hoa. Lieutenant. Sir Montano: Helpe Masters. Heere's a goodly Watch indeed. Who's that which rings the Bell: Diablo, hoa: The Towne will rise. Fie, fie Lieutenant, You'le be asham'd for euer. What is the matter heere? I bleed still, I am hurt to th' death. He dies Hold for your liues Hold hoa: Lieutenant, Sir Montano, Gentlemen: Haue you forgot all place of sense and dutie? The Generall speaks to you: hold for shame Why how now hoa? From whence ariseth this? Are we turn'd Turkes? and to our selues do that Which Heauen hath forbid the Ottamittes. For Christian shame, put by this barbarous Brawle: He that stirs next, to carue for his owne rage, Holds his soule light: He dies vpon his Motion. Silence that dreadfull Bell, it frights the Isle, From her propriety. What is the matter, Masters? Honest Iago, that lookes dead with greeuing, Speake: who began this? On thy loue I charge thee? I do not know: Friends all, but now, euen now. In Quarter, and in termes like Bride, and Groome Deuesting them for Bed: and then, but now: (As if some Planet had vnwitted men) Swords out, and tilting one at others breastes, In opposition bloody. I cannot speake Any begining to this peeuish oddes. And would, in Action glorious, I had lost Those legges, that brought me to a part of it How comes it (Michaell) you are thus forgot? I pray you pardon me, I cannot speake Worthy Montano, you were wont to be ciuill: The grauitie, and stillnesse of your youth The world hath noted. And your name is great In mouthes of wisest Censure. What's the matter That you vnlace your reputation thus, And spend your rich opinion, for the name Of a night-brawler? Giue me answer to it Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger, Your Officer Iago, can informe you, While I spare speech which something now offends me. Of all that I do know, nor know I ought By me, that's said, or done amisse this night, Vnlesse selfe-charitie be sometimes a vice, And to defend our selues, it be a sinne When violence assailes vs Now by Heauen, My blood begins my safer Guides to rule, And passion (hauing my best iudgement collied) Assaies to leade the way. If I once stir, Or do but lift this Arme, the best of you Shall sinke in my rebuke. Giue me to know How this foule Rout began: Who set it on, And he that is approu'd in this offence, Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth, Shall loose me. What in a Towne of warre, Yet wilde, the peoples hearts brim-full of feare, To Manage priuate, and domesticke Quarrell? In night, and on the Court and Guard of safetie? 'Tis monstrous: Iago, who began't? If partially Affin'd, or league in office, Thou dost deliuer more, or lesse then Truth, Thou art no Souldier Touch me not so neere, I had rather haue this tongue cut from my mouth, Then it should do offence to Michaell Cassio. Yet I perswade my selfe, to speake the truth Shall nothing wrong him. This it is Generall: Montano and my selfe being in speech, There comes a Fellow, crying out for helpe, And Cassio following him with determin'd Sword To execute vpon him. Sir, this Gentleman, Steppes in to Cassio, and entreats his pause: My selfe, the crying Fellow did pursue, Least by his clamour (as it so fell out) The Towne might fall in fright. He, (swift of foote) Out-ran my purpose: and I return'd then rather For that I heard the clinke, and fall of Swords, And Cassio high in oath: Which till to night I nere might say before. When I came backe (For this was briefe) I found them close together At blow, and thrust, euen as againe they were When you your selfe did part them. More of this matter cannot I report, But Men are Men: The best sometimes forget, Though Cassio did some little wrong to him, As men in rage strike those that wish them best, Yet surely Cassio, I beleeue receiu'd From him that fled, some strange Indignitie, Which patience could not passe I know Iago Thy honestie, and loue doth mince this matter, Making it light to Cassio: Cassio, I loue thee, But neuer more be Officer of mine. Looke if my gentle Loue be not rais'd vp: Ile make thee an example What is the matter (Deere?) All's well, Sweeting: Come away to bed. Sir for your hurts, My selfe will be your Surgeon. Lead him off: Iago, looke with care about the Towne, And silence those whom this vil'd brawle distracted. Come Desdemona, 'tis the Soldiers life, To haue their Balmy slumbers wak'd with strife. What are you hurt Lieutenant? I, past all Surgery Marry Heauen forbid Reputation, Reputation, Reputation: Oh I haue lost my Reputation. I haue lost the immortall part of myselfe, and what remaines is bestiall. My Reputation, Iago, my Reputation As I am an honest man I had thought you had receiued some bodily wound; there is more sence in that then in Reputation. Reputation is an idle, and most false imposition; oft got without merit, and lost without deseruing. You haue lost no Reputation at all, vnlesse you repute your selfe such a looser. What man, there are more wayes to recouer the Generall againe. You are but now cast in his moode, (a punishment more in policie, then in malice) euen so as one would beate his offencelesse dogge, to affright an Imperious Lyon. Sue to him againe, and he's yours I will rather sue to be despis'd, then to deceiue so good a Commander, with so slight, so drunken, and so indiscreet an Officer. Drunke? And speake Parrat? And squabble? Swagger? Sweare? And discourse Fustian with ones owne shadow? Oh thou invisible spirit of Wine, if thou hast no name to be knowne by, let vs call thee Diuell What was he that you follow'd with your Sword? What had he done to you? I know not Is't possible? I remember a masse of things, but nothing distinctly: a Quarrell, but nothing wherefore. Oh, that men should put an Enemie in their mouthes, to steale away their Braines? that we should with ioy, pleasance, reuell and applause, transforme our selues into Beasts Why? But you are now well enough: how came you thus recouered? It hath pleas'd the diuell drunkennesse, to giue place to the diuell wrath, one vnperfectnesse, shewes me another to make me frankly despise my selfe Come, you are too seuere a Moraller. As the Time, the Place, & the Condition of this Country stands I could hartily wish this had not befalne: but since it is, as it is, mend it for your owne good I will aske him for my Place againe, he shall tell me, I am a drunkard: had I as many mouthes as Hydra, such an answer would stop them all. To be now a sensible man, by and by a Foole, and presently a Beast. Oh strange! Euery inordinate cup is vnbless'd, and the Ingredient is a diuell Come, come: good wine, is a good familiar Creature, if it be well vs'd: exclaime no more against it. And good Lieutenant, I thinke, you thinke I loue you I haue well approued it, Sir. I drunke? You, or any man liuing, may be drunke at a time man. I tell you what you shall do: Our General's Wife, is now the Generall. I may say so, in this respect, for that he hath deuoted, and giuen vp himselfe to the Contemplation, marke: and deuotement of her parts and Graces. Confesse your selfe freely to her: Importune her helpe to put you in your place againe. She is of so free, so kinde, so apt, so blessed a disposition, she holds it a vice in her goodnesse, not to do more then she is requested. This broken ioynt betweene you, and her husband, entreat her to splinter. And my Fortunes against any lay worth naming, this cracke of your Loue, shall grow stronger, then it was before You aduise me well I protest in the sinceritie of Loue, and honest kindnesse I thinke it freely: and betimes in the morning, I will beseech the vertuous Desdemona to vndertake for me: I am desperate of my Fortunes if they check me You are in the right: good night Lieutenant, I must to the Watch Good night, honest Iago. And what's he then, That saies I play the Villaine? When this aduise is free I giue, and honest, Proball to thinking, and indeed the course To win the Moore againe. For 'tis most easie Th' inclyning Desdemona to subdue In any honest Suite. She's fram'd as fruitefull As the free Elements. And then for her To win the Moore, were to renownce his Baptisme, All Seales, and Simbols of redeemed sin: His Soule is so enfetter'd to her Loue, That she may make, vnmake, do what she list, Euen as her Appetite shall play the God, With his weake Function. How am I then a Villaine, To Counsell Cassio to this paralell course, Directly to his good? Diuinitie of hell, When diuels will the blackest sinnes put on, They do suggest at first with heauenly shewes, As I do now. For whiles this honest Foole Plies Desdemona, to repaire his Fortune, And she for him, pleades strongly to the Moore, Ile powre this pestilence into his eare: That she repeales him, for her bodies Lust, And by how much she striues to do him good, She shall vndo her Credite with the Moore. So will I turne her vertue into pitch. And out of her owne goodnesse make the Net, That shall en-mash them all. How now Rodorigo? I do follow heere in the Chace, not like a Hound that hunts, but one that filles vp the My Money is almost spent; I haue bin to night exceedingly well Cudgell'd: And I thinke the issue will bee, I shall haue so much experience for my paines; And so, with no money at all, and a little more Wit, returne againe to Venice How poore are they that haue not Patience? What wound did euer heale but by degrees? Thou know'st we worke by Wit, and not by Witchcraft And Wit depends on dilatory time: Dos't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee, And thou by that small hurt hath casheer'd Cassio: Though other things grow faire against the Sun, Yet Fruites that blossome first, will first be ripe: Content thy selfe, a-while. Introth 'tis Morning; Pleasure, and Action, make the houres seeme short. Retire thee, go where thou art Billited: Away, I say, thou shalt know more heereafter: Nay get thee gone. Two things are to be done: My Wife must moue for Cassio to her Mistris: Ile set her on my selfe, a while, to draw the Moor apart, And bring him iumpe, when he may Cassio finde Soliciting his wife: I, that's the way: Dull not Deuice, by coldnesse, and delay. Masters, play heere, I wil content your paines, Something that's briefe: and bid, goodmorrow General Why Masters, haue your Instruments bin in Naples, that they speake i'th' Nose thus? How Sir? how? Are these I pray you, winde Instruments? I marry are they sir Oh, thereby hangs a tale Whereby hangs a tale, sir? Marry sir, by many a winde Instrument that I know. But Masters, heere's money for you: and the Generall so likes your Musick, that he desires you for loues sake to make no more noise with it Well Sir, we will not If you haue any Musicke that may not be heard, too't againe. But (as they say) to heare Musicke, the Generall do's not greatly care We haue none such, sir Then put vp your Pipes in your bagge, for Ile away. Go, vanish into ayre, away. Dost thou heare me, mine honest Friend? No, I heare not your honest Friend: I heare you Prythee keepe vp thy Quillets, ther's a poore peece of Gold for thee: if the Gentlewoman that attends the Generall be stirring, tell her, there's one Cassio entreats her a little fauour of Speech. Wilt thou do this? She is stirring sir: if she will stirre hither, I shall seeme to notifie vnto her. In happy time, Iago You haue not bin a-bed then? Why no: the day had broke before we parted. I haue made bold (Iago) to send in to your wife: My suite to her is, that she will to vertuous Desdemona Procure me some accesse Ile send her to you presently: And Ile deuise a meane to draw the Moore Out of the way, that your conuerse and businesse May be more free. I humbly thanke you for't. I neuer knew A Florentine more kinde, and honest. Goodmorrow (good Lieutenant) I am sorrie For your displeasure: but all will sure be well. The Generall and his wife are talking of it, And she speakes for you stoutly. The Moore replies, That he you hurt is of great Fame in Cyprus, And great Affinitie: and that in wholsome Wisedome He might not but refuse you. But he protests he loues you And needs no other Suitor, but his likings To bring you in againe Yet I beseech you, If you thinke fit, or that it may be done, Giue me aduantage of some breefe Discourse With Desdemon alone. Pray you come in: I will bestow you where you shall haue time To speake your bosome freely I am much bound to you. Scoena Secunda. These Letters giue (Iago) to the Pylot, And by him do my duties to the Senate: That done, I will be walking on the Workes, Repaire there to mee Well, my good Lord, Ile doo't This Fortification (Gentlemen) shall we see't? Well waite vpon your Lordship. Scoena Tertia. Be thou assur'd (good Cassio) I will do All my abilities in thy behalfe. Good Madam do: I warrant it greeues my Husband, As if the cause were his Oh that's an honest Fellow, Do not doubt Cassio But I will haue my Lord, and you againe As friendly as you were Bounteous Madam, What euer shall become of Michael Cassio, He's neuer any thing but your true Seruant I know't: I thanke you: you do loue my Lord: You haue knowne him long, and be you well assur'd He shall in strangenesse stand no farther off, Then in a politique distance I, but Lady, That policie may either last so long, Or feede vpon such nice and waterish diet, Or breede it selfe so out of Circumstances, That I being absent, and my place supply'd, My Generall will forget my Loue, and Seruice Do not doubt that: before aemilia here, I giue thee warrant of thy place. Assure thee, If I do vow a friendship, Ile performe it To the last Article. My Lord shall neuer rest, Ile watch him tame, and talke him out of patience; His Bed shall seeme a Schoole, his Boord a Shrift, Ile intermingle euery thing he do's With Cassio's suite: Therefore be merry Cassio, For thy Solicitor shall rather dye, Then giue thy cause away. Madam, heere comes my Lord Madam, Ile take my leaue Why stay, and heare me speake Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease, Vnfit for mine owne purposes Well, do your discretion. Hah? I like not that What dost thou say? Nothing my Lord; or if- I know not what Was not that Cassio parted from my wife? Cassio my Lord? No sure, I cannot thinke it That he would steale away so guilty-like, Seeing your comming I do beleeue 'twas he How now my Lord? I haue bin talking with a Suitor heere, A man that languishes in your displeasure Who is't you meane? Why your Lieutenant Cassio: Good my Lord, If I haue any grace, or power to moue you, His present reconciliation take. For if he be not one, that truly loues you, That erres in Ignorance, and not in Cunning, I haue no iudgement in an honest face. I prythee call him backe Went he hence now? I sooth; so humbled, That he hath left part of his greefe with mee To suffer with him. Good Loue, call him backe Not now (sweet Desdemon) some other time But shall't be shortly? The sooner (Sweet) for you Shall't be to night, at Supper? No, not to night To morrow Dinner then? I shall not dine at home: I meete the Captaines at the Cittadell Why then to morrow night, on Tuesday morne, On Tuesday noone, or night; on Wensday Morne. I prythee name the time, but let it not Exceed three dayes. Infaith hee's penitent: And yet his Trespasse, in our common reason (Saue that they say the warres must make example) Out of her best, is not almost a fault T' encurre a priuate checke. When shall he come? Tell me Othello. I wonder in my Soule What you would aske me, that I should deny, Or stand so mam'ring on? What? Michael Cassio, That came a woing with you? and so many a time (When I haue spoke of you dispraisingly) Hath tane your part, to haue so much to do To bring him in? Trust me, I could do much Prythee no more: Let him come when he will: I will deny thee nothing Why, this is not a Boone: 'Tis as I should entreate you weare your Gloues, Or feede on nourishing dishes, or keepe you warme, Or sue to you, to do a peculiar profit To your owne person. Nay, when I haue a suite Wherein I meane to touch your Loue indeed, It shall be full of poize, and difficult waight, And fearefull to be granted I will deny thee nothing. Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this, To leaue me but a little to my selfe Shall I deny you? No: farewell my Lord Farewell my Desdemona, Ile come to thee strait aemilia come; be as your Fancies teach you: What ere you be, I am obedient. Excellent wretch: Perdition catch my Soule But I do loue thee: and when I loue thee not, Chaos is come againe My Noble Lord What dost thou say, Iago? Did Michael Cassio When he woo'd my Lady, know of your loue? He did, from first to last: Why dost thou aske? But for a satisfaction of my Thought, No further harme Why of thy thought, Iago? I did not thinke he had bin acquainted with hir O yes, and went betweene vs very oft Indeed? Indeed? I indeed. Discern'st thou ought in that? Is he not honest? Honest, my Lord? Honest? I, Honest My Lord, for ought I know What do'st thou thinke? Thinke, my Lord? Thinke, my Lord? Alas, thou ecchos't me; As if there were some Monster in thy thought Too hideous to be shewne. Thou dost mean somthing: I heard thee say euen now, thou lik'st not that, When Cassio left my wife. What didd'st not like? And when I told thee, he was of my Counsaile, Of my whole course of wooing; thou cried'st, Indeede? And didd'st contract, and purse thy brow together, As if thou then hadd'st shut vp in thy Braine Some horrible Conceite. If thou do'st loue me, Shew me thy thought My Lord, you know I loue you I thinke thou do'st: And for I know thou'rt full of Loue, and Honestie, And weigh'st thy words before thou giu'st them breath, Therefore these stops of thine, fright me the more: For such things in a false disloyall Knaue Are trickes of Custome: but in a man that's iust, They're close dilations, working from the heart, That Passion cannot rule For Michael Cassio, I dare be sworne, I thinke that he is honest I thinke so too Men should be what they seeme, Or those that be not, would they might seeme none Certaine, men should be what they seeme Why then I thinke Cassio's an honest man Nay, yet there's more in this? I prythee speake to me, as to thy thinkings, As thou dost ruminate, and giue thy worst of thoughts The worst of words Good my Lord pardon me, Though I am bound to euery Acte of dutie, I am not bound to that: All Slaues are free: Vtter my Thoughts? Why say, they are vild, and falce? As where's that Palace, whereinto foule things Sometimes intrude not? Who ha's that breast so pure, Wherein vncleanly Apprehensions Keepe Leetes, and Law-dayes, and in Sessions sit With meditations lawfull? Thou do'st conspire against thy Friend (Iago) If thou but think'st him wrong'd, and mak'st his eare A stranger to thy Thoughts I do beseech you, Though I perchance am vicious in my guesse (As I confesse it is my Natures plague To spy into Abuses, and of my iealousie Shapes faults that are not) that your wisedome From one, that so imperfectly conceits, Would take no notice, nor build your selfe a trouble Out of his scattering, and vnsure obseruance: It were not for your quiet, nor your good, Nor for my Manhood, Honesty, and Wisedome, To let you know my thoughts What dost thou meane? Good name in Man, & woman (deere my Lord) Is the immediate Iewell of their Soules; Who steales my purse, steales trash: 'Tis something, nothing; 'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has bin slaue to thousands: But he that filches from me my good Name, Robs me of that, which not enriches him, And makes me poore indeed Ile know thy Thoughts You cannot, if my heart were in your hand, Nor shall not, whil'st 'tis in my custodie Ha? Oh, beware my Lord, of iealousie, It is the greene-ey'd Monster, which doth mocke The meate it feeds on. That Cuckold liues in blisse, Who certaine of his Fate, loues not his wronger: But oh, what damned minutes tels he ore, Who dotes, yet doubts: Suspects, yet soundly loues? O miserie Poore, and Content, is rich, and rich enough, But Riches finelesse, is as poore as Winter, To him that euer feares he shall be poore: Good Heauen, the Soules of all my Tribe defend From Iealousie Why? why is this? Think'st thou, I'ld make a Life of Iealousie; To follow still the changes of the Moone With fresh suspitions? No: to be once in doubt, Is to be resolu'd: Exchange me for a Goat, When I shall turne the businesse of my Soule To such exufflicate, and blow'd Surmises, Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me Iealious, To say my wife is faire, feeds well, loues company, Is free of Speech, Sings, Playes, and Dances: Where Vertue is, these are more vertuous. Nor from mine owne weake merites, will I draw The smallest feare, or doubt of her reuolt, For she had eyes, and chose me. No Iago, Ile see before I doubt; when I doubt, proue; And on the proofe, there is no more but this, Away at once with Loue, or Iealousie I am glad of this: For now I shall haue reason To shew the Loue and Duty that I beare you With franker spirit. Therefore (as I am bound) Receiue it from me. I speake not yet of proofe: Looke to your wife, obserue her well with Cassio, Weare your eyes, thus: not Iealious, nor Secure: I would not haue your free, and Noble Nature, Out of selfe-Bounty, be abus'd: Looke too't: I know our Country disposition well: In Venice, they do let Heauen see the prankes They dare not shew their Husbands. Their best Conscience, Is not to leaue't vndone, but kept vnknowne Dost thou say so? She did deceiue her Father, marrying you, And when she seem'd to shake, and feare your lookes, She lou'd them most And so she did Why go too then: Shee that so young could giue out such a Seeming To seele her Fathers eyes vp, close as Oake, He thought 'twas Witchcraft. But I am much too blame: I humbly do beseech you of your pardon For too much louing you I am bound to thee for euer I see this hath a little dash'd your Spirits: Not a iot, not a iot Trust me, I feare it has: I hope you will consider what is spoke Comes from your Loue. But I do see y'are moou'd: I am to pray you, not to straine my speech To grosser issues, nor to larger reach, Then to Suspition I will not Should you do so (my Lord) My speech should fall into such vilde successe, Which my Thoughts aym'd not. Cassio's my worthy Friend: My Lord, I see y'are mou'd No, not much mou'd: I do not thinke but Desdemona's honest Long liue she so; And long liue you to thinke so And yet how Nature erring from it selfe I, there's the point: As (to be bold with you) Not to affect many proposed Matches Of her owne Clime, Complexion, and Degree, Whereto we see in all things, Nature tends: Foh, one may smel in such, a will most ranke, Foule disproportions, Thoughts vnnaturall. But (pardon me) I do not in position Distinctly speake of her, though I may feare Her will, recoyling to her better iudgement, May fal to match you with her Country formes, And happily repent Farewell, farewell: If more thou dost perceiue, let me know more: Set on thy wife to obserue. Leaue me Iago My Lord, I take my leaue Why did I marry? This honest Creature (doubtlesse) Sees, and knowes more, much more then he vnfolds My Lord, I would I might intreat your Honor To scan this thing no farther: Leaue it to time, Although 'tis fit that Cassio haue his Place; For sure he filles it vp with great Ability; Yet if you please, to him off a-while: You shall by that perceiue him, and his meanes: Note if your Lady straine his Entertainment With any strong, or vehement importunitie, Much will be seene in that: In the meane time, Let me be thought too busie in my feares, (As worthy cause I haue to feare I am) And hold her free, I do beseech your Honor Feare not my gouernment I once more take my leaue. This Fellow's of exceeding honesty, And knowes all Quantities with a learn'd Spirit Of humane dealings. If I do proue her Haggard, Though that her Iesses were my deere heart-strings, I'ld whistle her off, and let her downe the winde To prey at Fortune. Haply, for I am blacke, And haue not those soft parts of Conuersation That Chamberers haue: Or for I am declin'd Into the vale of yeares (yet that's not much) Shee's gone. I am abus'd, and my releefe Must be to loath her. Oh Curse of Marriage! That we can call these delicate Creatures ours, And not their Appetites? I had rather be a Toad, And liue vpon the vapour of a Dungeon, Then keepe a corner in the thing I loue For others vses. Yet 'tis the plague to Great-ones, Prerogatiu'd are they lesse then the Base, 'Tis destiny vnshunnable, like death: Euen then, this forked plague is Fated to vs, When we do quicken. Looke where she comes: If she be false, Heauen mock'd it selfe: Ile not beleeue't How now, my deere Othello? Your dinner, and the generous Islanders By you inuited, do attend your presence I am too blame Why do you speake so faintly? Are you not well? I haue a paine vpon my Forehead, heere Why that's with watching, 'twill away againe. Let me but binde it hard, within this houre It will be well Your Napkin is too little: Let it alone: Come, Ile go in with you. I am very sorry that you are not well. I am glad I haue found this Napkin: This was her first remembrance from the Moore, My wayward Husband hath a hundred times Woo'd me to steale it. But she so loues the Token, (For he coniur'd her, she should euer keepe it) That she reserues it euermore about her, To kisse, and talke too. Ile haue the worke tane out, And giu't Iago: what he will do with it Heauen knowes, not I: I nothing, but to please his Fantasie. How now? What do you heere alone? Do not you chide: I haue a thing for you You haue a thing for me? It is a common thing- Hah? To haue a foolish wife. Oh, is that all? What will you giue me now For that same Handkerchiefe What Handkerchiefe? What Handkerchiefe? Why that the Moore first gaue to Desdemona, That which so often you did bid me steale Hast stolne it from her? No: but she let it drop by negligence, And to th' aduantage, I being heere, took't vp: Looke, heere 'tis A good wench, giue it me. What will you do with't, that you haue bene so earnest to haue me filch it? Why, what is that to you? If it be not for some purpose of import, Giu't me againe. Poore Lady, shee'l run mad When she shall lacke it Be not acknowne on't: I haue vse for it. Go, leaue me. I will in Cassio's Lodging loose this Napkin, And let him finde it. Trifles light as ayre, Are to the iealious, confirmations strong, As proofes of holy Writ. This may do something. The Moore already changes with my poyson: Dangerous conceites, are in their Natures poysons, Which at the first are scarse found to distaste: But with a little acte vpon the blood, Burne like the Mines of Sulphure. I did say so. Looke where he comes: Not Poppy, nor Mandragora, Nor all the drowsie Syrrups of the world Shall euer medicine thee to that sweete sleepe Which thou owd'st yesterday Ha, ha, false to mee? Why how now Generall? No more of that Auant, be gone: Thou hast set me on the Racke: I sweare 'tis better to be much abus'd, Then but to know't a little How now, my Lord? What sense had I, in her stolne houres of Lust? I saw't not, thought it not: it harm'd not me: I slept the next night well, fed well, was free, and merrie. I found not Cassio's kisses on her Lippes: He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stolne, Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all I am sorry to heare this? I had beene happy, if the generall Campe, Pyoners and all, had tasted her sweet Body, So I had nothing knowne. Oh now, for euer Farewell the Tranquill minde; farewell Content; Farewell the plumed Troopes, and the bigge Warres, That makes Ambition, Vertue! Oh farewell, Farewell the neighing Steed, and the shrill Trumpe, The Spirit-stirring Drum, th' Eare-piercing Fife, The Royall Banner, and all Qualitie, Pride, Pompe, and Circumstance of glorious Warre: And O you mortall Engines, whose rude throates Th' immortall Ioues dread Clamours, counterfet, Farewell: Othello's Occupation's gone Is't possible my Lord? Villaine, be sure thou proue my Loue a Whore; Be sure of it: Giue me the Occular proofe, Or by the worth of mine eternall Soule, Thou had'st bin better haue bin borne a Dog Then answer my wak'd wrath Is't come to this? Make me to see't: or (at the least) so proue it, That the probation beare no Hindge, nor Loope, To hang a doubt on: Or woe vpon thy life My Noble Lord If thou dost slander her, and torture me, Neuer pray more: Abandon all remorse On Horrors head, Horrors accumulate: Do deeds to make Heauen weepe, all Earth amaz'd; For nothing canst thou to damnation adde, Greater then that O Grace! O Heauen forgiue me! Are you a Man? Haue you a Soule? or Sense? God buy you: take mine Office. Oh wretched Foole, That lou'st to make thine Honesty, a Vice! Oh monstrous world! Take note, take note (O World) To be direct and honest, is not safe. I thanke you for this profit, and from hence Ile loue no Friend, sith Loue breeds such offence Nay stay: thou should'st be honest I should be wise; for Honestie's a Foole, And looses that it workes for By the World, I thinke my Wife be honest, and thinke she is not: I thinke that thou art iust, and thinke thou art not: Ile haue some proofe. My name that was as fresh As Dians Visage, is now begrim'd and blacke As mine owne face. If there be Cords, or Kniues, Poyson, or Fire, or suffocating streames, Ile not indure it. Would I were satisfied I see you are eaten vp with Passion: I do repent me, that I put it to you. You would be satisfied? Would? Nay, and I will And may: but how? How satisfied, my Lord? Would you the super-vision grossely gape on? Behold her top'd? Death, and damnation. Oh! It were a tedious difficulty, I thinke, To bring them to that Prospect: Damne them then, If euer mortall eyes do see them boulster More then their owne. What then? How then? What shall I say? Where's Satisfaction? It is impossible you should see this, Were they as prime as Goates, as hot as Monkeyes, As salt as Wolues in pride, and Fooles as grosse As Ignorance, made drunke. But yet, I say, If imputation, and strong circumstances, Which leade directly to the doore of Truth, Will giue you satisfaction, you might haue't Giue me a liuing reason she's disloyall I do not like the Office. But sith I am entred in this cause so farre (Prick'd too't by foolish Honesty, and Loue) I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately, And being troubled with a raging tooth, I could not sleepe. There are a kinde of men, So loose of Soule, that in their sleepes will mutter Their Affayres: one of this kinde is Cassio: In sleepe I heard him say, sweet Desdemona, Let vs be wary, let vs hide our Loues, And then (Sir) would he gripe, and wring my hand: Cry, oh sweet Creature: then kisse me hard, As if he pluckt vp kisses by the rootes, That grew vpon my lippes, laid his Leg ore my Thigh, And sigh, and kisse, and then cry cursed Fate, That gaue thee to the Moore O monstrous! monstrous! Nay, this was but his Dreame But this denoted a fore-gone conclusion, 'Tis a shrew'd doubt, though it be but a Dreame And this may helpe to thicken other proofes, That do demonstrate thinly Ile teare her all to peeces Nay yet be wise; yet we see nothing done, She may be honest yet: Tell me but this, Haue you not sometimes seene a Handkerchiefe Spotted with Strawberries, in your wiues hand? I gaue her such a one: 'twas my first gift I know not that: but such a Handkerchiefe (I am sure it was your wiues) did I to day See Cassio wipe his Beard with If it be that If it be that, or any, it was here. It speakes against her with the other proofes O that the Slaue had forty thousand liues: One is too poore, too weake for my reuenge. Now do I see 'tis true. Looke heere Iago, All my fond loue thus do I blow to Heauen. 'Tis gone. Arise blacke vengeance, from the hollow hell, Yeeld vp (O Loue) thy Crowne, and hearted Throne To tyrannous Hate. Swell bosome with thy fraught, For 'tis of Aspickes tongues Yet be content Oh blood, blood, blood Patience I say: your minde may change Neuer Iago. Like to the Ponticke Sea, Whose Icie Current, and compulsiue course, Neu'r keepes retyring ebbe, but keepes due on To the Proponticke, and the Hellespont: Euen so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace Shall neu'r looke backe, neu'r ebbe to humble Loue, Till that a capeable, and wide Reuenge Swallow them vp. Now by yond Marble Heauen, In the due reuerence of a Sacred vow, I heere engage my words Do not rise yet: Witnesse you euer-burning Lights aboue, You Elements, that clip vs round about, Witnesse that heere Iago doth giue vp The execution of his wit, hands, heart, To wrong'd Othello's Seruice. Let him command, And to obey shall be in me remorse, What bloody businesse euer I greet thy loue, Not with vaine thanks, but with acceptance bounteous, And will vpon the instant put thee too't. That Cassio's not aliue My Friend is dead: 'Tis done at your Request. But let her liue Damne her lewde Minx: O damne her, damne her. Come go with me a-part, I will withdraw To furnish me with some swift meanes of death For the faire Diuell. Now art thou my Lieutenant I am your owne for euer. Scaena Quarta. Do you know Sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lyes? I dare not say he lies any where Why man? He's a Soldier, and for me to say a Souldier lyes, 'tis stabbing Go too: where lodges he? To tell you where he lodges, is to tel you where I lye Can any thing be made of this? I know not where he lodges, and for mee to deuise a lodging, and say he lies heere, or he lies there, were to lye in mine owne throat Can you enquire him out? and be edified by report? I will Catechize the world for him, that is, make Questions, and by them answer Seeke him, bidde him come hither: tell him, I haue moou'd my Lord on his behalfe, and hope all will be well To do this, is within the compasse of mans Wit, and therefore I will attempt the doing it. Where should I loose the Handkerchiefe, aemilia? I know not Madam Beleeue me, I had rather haue lost my purse Full of Cruzadoes. And but my Noble Moore Is true of minde, and made of no such basenesse, As iealious Creatures are, it were enough To put him to ill-thinking. Is he not iealious? Who, he? I thinke the Sun where he was borne, Drew all such humors from him. Looke where he comes. I will not leaue him now, till Cassio be Call'd to him. How is't with you, my Lord? Well my good Lady. Oh hardnes to dissemble! How do you, Desdemona? Well, my good Lord Giue me your hand. This hand is moist, my Lady It hath felt no age, nor knowne no sorrow This argues fruitfulnesse, and liberall heart: Hot, hot, and moyst. This hand of yours requires A sequester from Liberty: Fasting, and Prayer, Much Castigation, Exercise deuout, For heere's a yong, and sweating Diuell heere That commonly rebels: 'Tis a good hand, A franke one You may (indeed) say so: For 'twas that hand that gaue away my heart A liberall hand. The hearts of old, gaue hands: But our new Heraldry is hands, not hearts I cannot speake of this: Come, now your promise What promise, Chucke? I haue sent to bid Cassio come speake with you I haue a salt and sorry Rhewme offends me: Lend me thy Handkerchiefe Heere my Lord That which I gaue you I haue it not about me Not? No indeed, my Lord That's a fault: That Handkerchiefe Did an aegyptian to my Mother giue: She was a Charmer, and could almost read The thoughts of people. She told her, while she kept it, 'T would make her Amiable, and subdue my Father Intirely to her loue: But if she lost it, Or made a Guift of it, my Fathers eye Should hold her loathed, and his Spirits should hunt After new Fancies. She dying, gaue it me, And bid me (when my Fate would haue me Wiu'd) To giue it her. I did so; and take heede on't, Make it a Darling, like your precious eye: To loose't, or giue't away, were such perdition, As nothing else could match Is't possible? 'Tis true: There's Magicke in the web of it: A Sybill that had numbred in the world The Sun to course, two hundred compasses, In her Prophetticke furie sow'd the Worke: The Wormes were hallowed, that did breede the Silke, And it was dyde in Mummey, which the Skilfull Conseru'd of Maidens hearts Indeed? Is't true? Most veritable, therefore looke too't well Then would to Heauen, that I had neuer seene't? Ha? wherefore? Why do you speake so startingly, and rash? Is't lost? Is't gon? Speak, is't out o'th' way? Blesse vs Say you? It is not lost: but what and if it were? How? I say it is not lost Fetcht, let me see't Why so I can: but I will not now: This is a tricke to put me from my suite, Pray you let Cassio be receiu'd againe Fetch me the Handkerchiefe, My minde mis-giues Come, come: you'l neuer meete a more sufficient man The Handkerchiefe A man that all his time Hath founded his good Fortunes on your loue; Shar'd dangers with you The Handkerchiefe Insooth, you are too blame Away. Is not this man iealious? I neu'r saw this before. Sure, there's some wonder in this Handkerchiefe, I am most vnhappy in the losse of it. 'Tis not a yeare or two shewes vs a man: They are all but Stomackes, and we all but Food, They eate vs hungerly, and when they are full They belch vs. Looke you, Cassio and my Husband There is no other way: 'tis she must doo't: And loe the happinesse: go, and importune her How now (good Cassio) what's the newes with you? Madam, my former suite. I do beseech you, That by your vertuous meanes, I may againe Exist, and be a member of his loue, Whom I, with all the Office of my heart Intirely honour, I would not be delayd. If my offence, be of such mortall kinde, That nor my Seruice past, nor present Sorrowes, Nor purpos'd merit in futurity, Can ransome me into his loue againe, But to know so, must be my benefit: So shall I cloath me in a forc'd content, And shut my selfe vp in some other course To Fortunes Almes Alas (thrice-gentle Cassio) My Aduocation is not now in Tune; My Lord, is not my Lord; nor should I know him, Were he in Fauour, as in Humour alter'd. So helpe me euery spirit sanctified, As I haue spoken for you all my best, And stood within the blanke of his displeasure For my free speech. You must awhile be patient: What I can do, I will: and more I will Then for my selfe, I dare. Let that suffice you Is my Lord angry? He went hence but now: And certainly in strange vnquietnesse Can he be angry? I haue seen the Cannon When it hath blowne his Rankes into the Ayre, And like the Diuell from his very Arme Puff't his owne Brother: And is he angry? Something of moment then: I will go meet him, There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry. I prythee do so. Something sure of State, Either from Venice, or some vnhatch'd practise Made demonstrable heere in Cyprus, to him, Hath pudled his cleare Spirit: and in such cases, Mens Natures wrangle with inferiour things, Though great ones are their obiect. 'Tis euen so. For let our finger ake, and it endues Our other healthfull members, euen to a sense Of paine. Nay, we must thinke men are not Gods, Nor of them looke for such obseruancie As fits the Bridall. Beshrew me much, aemilia, I was (vnhandsome Warrior, as I am) Arraigning his vnkindnesse with my soule: But now I finde, I had suborn'd the Witnesse, And he's Indited falsely. Pray heauen it bee State matters, as you thinke, and no Conception, Nor no Iealious Toy, concerning you Alas the day, I neuer gaue him cause. But Iealious soules will not be answer'd so; They are not euer iealious for the cause, But iealious, for they're iealious. It is a Monster Begot vpon it selfe, borne on it selfe Heauen keepe the Monster from Othello's mind. Lady, Amen I will go seeke him. Cassio, walke heere about: If I doe finde him fit, Ile moue your suite, And seeke to effect it to my vttermost. I humbly thanke your Ladyship. 'Saue you (Friend Cassio.) What make you from home? How is't with you, my most faire Bianca? Indeed (sweet Loue) I was comming to your house And I was going to your Lodging, Cassio. What? keepe a weeke away? Seuen dayes, and Nights? Eight score eight houres? And Louers absent howres More tedious then the Diall, eight score times? Oh weary reck'ning Pardon me, Bianca: I haue this while with leaden thoughts beene prest, But I shall in a more continuate time Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca Take me this worke out Oh Cassio, whence came this? This is some Token from a newer Friend, To the felt-Absence: now I feele a Cause: Is't come to this? Well, well Go too, woman: Throw your vilde gesses in the Diuels teeth, From whence you haue them. You are iealious now, That this is from some Mistris, some remembrance; No, in good troth Bianca Why, who's is it? I know not neither: I found it in my Chamber, I like the worke well; Ere it be demanded (As like enough it will) I would haue it coppied: Take it, and doo't, and leaue me for this time Leaue you? Wherefore? I do attend heere on the Generall, And thinke it no addition, nor my wish To haue him see me woman'd Why, I pray you? Not that I loue you not But that you do not loue me. I pray you bring me on the way a little, And say, if I shall see you soone at night? 'Tis but a little way that I can bring you, For I attend heere: But Ile see you soone 'Tis very good: I must be circumstanc'd. Will you thinke so? Thinke so, Iago? What, to kisse in priuate? An vnauthoriz'd kisse? Or to be naked with her Friend in bed, An houre, or more, not meaning any harme? Naked in bed (Iago) and not meane harme? It is hypocrisie against the Diuell: They that meane vertuously, and yet do so, The Diuell their vertue tempts, and they tempt Heauen If they do nothing, 'tis a Veniall slip: But if I giue my wife a Handkerchiefe What then? Why then 'tis hers (my Lord) and being hers, She may (I thinke) bestow't on any man She is Protectresse of her honor too: May she giue that? Her honor is an Essence that's not seene, They haue it very oft, that haue it not. But for the Handkerchiefe By heauen, I would most gladly haue forgot it: Thou saidst (oh, it comes ore my memorie, As doth the Rauen o're the infectious house: Boading to all) he had my Handkerchiefe Iago . I: what of that? That's not so good now What if I had said, I had seene him do you wrong? Or heard him say (as Knaues be such abroad, Who hauing by their owne importunate suit, Or voluntary dotage of some Mistris, Conuinced or supply'd them, cannot chuse But they must blab.) Hath he said any thing? He hath (my Lord) but be you well assur'd, No more then he'le vn-sweare What hath he said? Why, that he did: I know not what he did What? What? Lye With her? With her? On her: what you will Lye with her? lye on her? We say lye on her, when they be-lye-her. Lye with her: that's fullsome: Handkerchiefe: Confessions: Handkerchiefe. To confesse, and be hang'd for his labour. First, to be hang'd, and then to confesse: I tremble at it. Nature would not inuest her selfe in such shadowing passion, without some It is not words that shakes me thus, (pish) Noses, Eares, and Lippes: is't possible. Confesse? Handkerchiefe? O diuell. Falls in a Traunce. Worke on, My Medicine workes. Thus credulous Fooles are caught, And many worthy, and chast Dames euen thus, (All guiltlesse) meete reproach: what hoa? My Lord? My Lord, I say: Othello. How now Cassio? What's the matter? My Lord is falne into an Epilepsie, This is his second Fit: he had one yesterday Rub him about the Temples The Lethargie must haue his quyet course: If not, he foames at mouth: and by and by Breakes out to sauage madnesse. Looke, he stirres: Do you withdraw your selfe a little while, He will recouer straight: when he is gone, I would on great occasion, speake with you. How is it Generall? Haue you not hurt your head? Dost thou mocke me? I mocke you not, by Heauen: Would you would beare your Fortune like a Man A Horned man's a Monster, and a Beast Ther's many a Beast then in a populous Citty, And many a ciuill Monster Did he confesse it? Good Sir, be a man: Thinke euery bearded fellow that's but yoak'd May draw with you. There's Millions now aliue, That nightly lye in those vnproper beds, Which they dare sweare peculiar. Your case is better. Oh, 'tis the spight of hell, the Fiends Arch-mock, To lip a wanton in a secure Cowch; And to suppose her chast. No, let me know, And knowing what I am, I know what she shallbe Oh, thou art wise: 'tis certaine Stand you a while apart, Confine your selfe but in a patient List, Whil'st you were heere, o're-whelmed with your griefe (A passion most resulting such a man) Cassio came hither: I shifted him away, And layd good scuses vpon your Extasie, Bad him anon returne: and heere speake with me, The which he promis'd. Do but encaue your selfe, And marke the Fleeres, the Gybes, and notable Scornes That dwell in euery Region of his face. For I will make him tell the Tale anew; Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when He hath, and is againe to cope your wife. I say, but marke his gesture: marry Patience, Or I shall say y'are all in all in Spleene, And nothing of a man Do'st thou heare, Iago, I will be found most cunning in my Patience: But (do'st thou heare) most bloody That's not amisse, But yet keepe time in all: will you withdraw? Now will I question Cassio of Bianca, A Huswife that by selling her desires Buyes her selfe Bread, and Cloath. It is a Creature That dotes on Cassio, (as 'tis the Strumpets plague To be-guile many, and be be-guil'd by one) He, when he heares of her, cannot restraine From the excesse of Laughter. Heere he comes. As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad: And his vnbookish Ielousie must conserue Poore Cassio's smiles, gestures, and light behauiours Quite in the wrong. How do you Lieutenant? The worser, that you giue me the addition, Whose want euen killes me Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't: Now, if this Suit lay in Bianca's dowre, How quickely should you speed? Alas poore Caitiffe Looke how he laughes already I neuer knew woman loue man so Alas poore Rogue, I thinke indeed she loues me Now he denies it faintly: and laughes it out Do you heare Cassio? Now he importunes him To tell it o're: go too, well said, well said She giues it out, that you shall marry her. Do you intend it? Ha, ha, ha Do ye triumph, Romaine? do you triumph? I marry. What? A customer; prythee beare Some Charitie to my wit, do not thinke it So vnwholesome. Ha, ha, ha So, so, so, so: they laugh, that winnes Why the cry goes, that you marry her Prythee say true I am a very Villaine else Haue you scoar'd me? Well This is the Monkeys owne giuing out: She is perswaded I will marry her Out of her owne loue & flattery, not out of my promise Iago becomes me: now he begins the story She was heere euen now: she haunts me in euery place. I was the other day talking on the Seabanke with certaine Venetians, and thither comes the Bauble, and falls me thus about my neck Crying oh deere Cassio, as it were: his iesture imports it So hangs, and lolls, and weepes vpon me: So shakes, and pulls me. Ha, ha, ha Now he tells how she pluckt him to my Chamber: oh, I see that nose of yours, but not that dogge, I shall throw it to Well, I must leaue her companie Before me: looke where she comes. 'Tis such another Fitchew: marry a perfum'd one? What do you meane by this haunting of me? Let the diuell, and his dam haunt you: what did you meane by that same Handkerchiefe, you gaue me euen now? I was a fine Foole to take it: I must take out the worke? A likely piece of worke, that you should finde it in your Chamber, and know not who left it there. This is some Minxes token, & I must take out the worke? There, giue it your Hobbey-horse, wheresoeuer you had it, Ile take out no worke on't How now, my sweete Bianca? How now? How now? By Heauen, that should be my Handkerchiefe If you'le come to supper to night you may, if you will not come when you are next prepar'd for. After her: after her I must, shee'l rayle in the streets else Will you sup there? Yes, I intend so Well, I may chance to see you: for I would very faine speake with you Prythee come: will you? Go too; say no more How shall I murther him, Iago Did you perceiue how he laugh'd at his vice? Oh, Iago And did you see the Handkerchiefe? Was that mine? Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the foolish woman your wife: she gaue it him and, he hath giu'n it his whore I would haue him nine yeeres a killing: A fine woman, a faire woman, a sweete woman? Nay, you must forget that I, let her rot and perish, and be damn'd to night, for she shall not liue. No, my heart is turn'd to stone: I strike it, and it hurts my hand. Oh, the world hath not a sweeter Creature: she might lye by an Emperours side, and command him Taskes Nay, that's not your way Hang her, I do but say what she is: so delicate with her Needle: an admirable Musitian. Oh she will sing the Sauagenesse out of a Beare: of so high and plenteous wit, and inuention? She's the worse for all this Oh, a thousand, a thousand times: And then of so gentle a condition? I too gentle Nay that's certaine: But yet the pitty of it, Iago: oh Iago, the pitty of it Iago If you are so fond ouer her iniquitie: giue her pattent to offend, for if it touch not you, it comes neere no body I will chop her into Messes: Cuckold me? Oh, 'tis foule in her With mine Officer? That's fouler Get me some poyson, Iago, this night. Ile not expostulate with her: least her body and beautie vnprouide my mind againe: this night Iago Do it not with poyson, strangle her in her bed, Euen the bed she hath contaminated Good, good: The Iustice of it pleases: very good And for Cassio, let me be his vndertaker: You shall heare more by midnight. Excellent good: What Trumpet is that same? I warrant something from Venice, 'Tis Lodouico, this, comes from the Duke. See, your wife's with him Saue you worthy Generall With all my heart Sir The Duke, and the Senators of Venice greet you I kisse the Instrument of their pleasures And what's the newes, good cozen Lodouico I am very glad to see you Signior: Welcome to Cyprus I thanke you: how do's Lieutenant Cassio? Liues Sir, Cozen, there's falne betweene him, & my Lord, An vnkind breach: but you shall make all well Are you sure of that? My Lord? This faile you not to do, as you will- He did not call: he's busie in the paper, Is there deuision 'twixt my Lord, and Cassio? A most vnhappy one: I would do much T' attone, them, for the loue I beare to Cassio Fire, and brimestone My Lord Are you wise? What is he angrie? May be the Letter mou'd him. For as I thinke, they do command him home, Deputing Cassio in his Gouernment Trust me, I am glad on't Indeed? My Lord? I am glad to see you mad Why, sweete Othello? Diuell I haue not deseru'd this My Lord, this would not be beleeu'd in Venice, Though I should sweare I saw't. 'Tis very much, Make her amends: she weepes Oh diuell, diuell: If that the Earth could teeme with womans teares, Each drop she falls, would proue a Crocodile: Out of my sight I will not stay to offend you Truely obedient Lady: I do beseech your Lordship call her backe Mistris My Lord What would you with her, Sir? Who I, my Lord? I, you did wish, that I would make her turne: Sir, she can turne, and turne: and yet go on And turne againe. And she can weepe, Sir, weepe. And she's obedient: as you say obedient. Very obedient: proceed you in your teares. Concerning this Sir, (oh well-painted passion) I am commanded home: get you away: Ile send for you anon. Sir I obey the Mandate, And will returne to Venice. Hence, auaunt: Cassio shall haue my Place. And Sir, to night I do entreat, that we may sup together. You are welcome Sir to Cyprus. Goates, and Monkeys. Is this the Noble Moore, whom our full Senate Call all in all sufficient? Is this the Nature Whom Passion could not shake? Whose solid vertue The shot of Accident, nor dart of Chance Could neither graze, nor pierce? He is much chang'd Are his wits safe? Is he not light of Braine? He's that he is: I may not breath my censure. What he might be: if what he might, he is not, I would to heauen he were What? Strike his wife? 'Faith that was not so well: yet would I knew That stroke would proue the worst Is it his vse? Or did the Letters, worke vpon his blood, And new create his fault? Alas, alas: It is not honestie in me to speake What I haue seene, and knowne. You shall obserue him, And his owne courses will denote him so, That I may saue my speech: do but go after And marke how he continues I am sorry that I am deceiu'd in him. Scena Secunda. You haue seene nothing then? Nor euer heard: nor euer did suspect Yes, you haue seene Cassio, and she together But then I saw no harme: and then I heard, Each syllable that breath made vp betweene them What? Did they neuer whisper? Neuer my Lord Nor send you out o'th' way? Neuer To fetch her Fan, her Gloues, her Mask, nor nothing? Neuer my Lord That's strange. I durst (my Lord) to wager, she is honest: Lay downe my Soule at stake: If you thinke other, Remoue your thought. It doth abuse your bosome: If any wretch haue put this in your head, Let Heauen requit it with the Serpents curse, For if she be not honest, chaste, and true, There's no man happy. The purest of their Wiues Is foule as Slander Bid her come hither: go. She saies enough: yet she's a simple Baud That cannot say as much. This is a subtile Whore: A Closset Locke and Key of Villanous Secrets, And yet she'le kneele, and pray: I haue seene her do't. My Lord, what is your will? Pray you Chucke come hither What is your pleasure? Let me see your eyes: looke in my face What horrible Fancie's this? Some of your Function Mistris: Leaue Procreants alone, and shut the doore: Cough, or cry hem; if any body come: Your Mystery, your Mystery: May dispatch. Vpon my knee, what doth your speech import? I vnderstand a Fury in your words Why? What art thou? Your wife my Lord: your true and loyall wife Come sweare it: damne thy selfe, least being like one of Heauen, the diuells themselues should feare to ceaze thee. Therefore be double damn'd: sweare thou art honest Heauen doth truely know it Heauen truely knowes, that thou art false as hell To whom my Lord? With whom? How am I false? Ah Desdemon, away, away, away Alas the heauy day: why do you weepe? Am I the motiue of these teares my Lord? If happely you my Father do suspect, An Instrument of this your calling backe, Lay not your blame on me: if you haue lost him, I haue lost him too Had it pleas'd Heauen, To try me with Affliction, had they rain'd All kind of Sores, and Shames on my bare-head: Steep'd me in pouertie to the very lippes. Giuen to Captiuitie, me, and my vtmost hopes, I should haue found in some place of my Soule A drop of patience. But alas, to make me The fixed Figure for the time of Scorne, To point his slow, and mouing finger at. Yet could I beare that too, well, very well: But there where I haue garnerd vp my heart, Where either I must liue, or beare no life, The Fountaine from the which my currant runnes, Or else dries vp: to be discarded thence, Or keepe it as a Cesterne, for foule Toades To knot and gender in. Turne thy complexion there: Patience, thou young and Rose-lip'd Cherubin, I heere looke grim as hell I hope my Noble Lord esteemes me honest Oh I, as Sommer Flyes are in the Shambles, That quicken euen with blowing. Oh thou weed: Who art so louely faire, and smell'st so sweete, That the Sense akes at thee, Would thou had'st neuer bin borne Alas, what ignorant sin haue I committed? Was this faire Paper? This most goodly Booke Made to write Whore vpon? What commited, Committed? Oh, thou publicke Commoner, I should make very Forges of my cheekes, That would to Cynders burne vp Modestie, Did I but speake thy deedes. What commited? Heauen stoppes the Nose at it, and the Moone winks: The baudy winde that kisses all it meetes, Is hush'd within the hollow Myne of Earth And will not hear't. What commited? By Heauen you do me wrong Are not you a Strumpet? No, as I am a Christian. If to preserue this vessell for my Lord, From any other foule vnlawfull touch Be not to be a Strumpet, I am none What, not a Whore? No, as I shall be sau'd Is't possible? Oh Heauen forgiue vs I cry you mercy then. I tooke you for that cunning Whore of Venice, That married with Othello. You Mistris, That haue the office opposite to Saint Peter, And keepes the gate of hell. You, you: I you. We haue done our course: there's money for your paines: I pray you turne the key, and keepe our counsaile. Alas, what do's this Gentleman conceiue? How do you Madam? how do you my good Lady? Faith, halfe a sleepe Good Madam, What's the matter with my Lord? With who? Why, with my Lord, Madam? Who is thy Lord? He that is yours, sweet Lady I haue none: do not talke to me, aemilia, I cannot weepe: nor answeres haue I none, But what should go by water. Prythee to night, Lay on my bed my wedding sheetes, remember, And call thy husband hither. Heere's a change indeed. 'Tis meete I should be vs'd so: very meete. How haue I bin behau'd, that he might sticke The small'st opinion on my least misvse? What is your pleasure Madam? How is't with you? I cannot tell: those that do teach yong Babes Do it with gentle meanes, and easie taskes. He might haue chid me so; for in good faith I am a Child to chiding What is the matter Lady? Alas (Iago) my Lord hath so bewhor'd her, Throwne such dispight, and heauy termes vpon her That true hearts cannot beare it Am I that name, Iago? What name, (faire Lady?) Such as she said my Lord did say I was. He call'd her whore: a Begger in his drinke: Could not haue laid such termes vpon his Callet Why did he so? I do not know: I am sure I am none such Do not weepe, do not weepe: alas the day. Hath she forsooke so many Noble Matches? Her Father? And her Country? And her Friends? To be call'd Whore? Would it not make one weepe? It is my wretched Fortune Beshrew him for't: How comes this Tricke vpon him? Nay, Heauen doth know I will be hang'd, if some eternall Villaine, Some busie and insinuating Rogue, Some cogging, cozening Slaue, to get some Office, Haue not deuis'd this Slander: I will be hang'd else Fie, there is no such man: it is impossible If any such there be, Heauen pardon him. A halter pardon him: And hell gnaw his bones. Why should he call her Whore? Who keepes her companie? What Place? What Time? What Forme? What liklyhood? The Moore's abus'd by some most villanous Knaue, Some base notorious Knaue, some scuruy Fellow. Oh Heauens, that such companions thou'd'st vnfold, And put in euery honest hand a whip To lash the Rascalls naked through the world, Euen from the East to th' West Speake within doore. Oh fie vpon them: some such Squire he was That turn'd your wit, the seamy-side without, And made you to suspect me with the Moore You are a Foole: go too Alas Iago, What shall I do to win my Lord againe? Good Friend, go to him: for by this light of Heauen, I know not how I lost him. Heere I kneele: If ere my will did trespasse 'gainst his Loue, Either in discourse of thought, or actuall deed, Or that mine Eyes, mine Eares, or any Sence Delighted them: or any other Forme. Or that I do not yet, and euer did, And euer will, (though he do shake me off To beggerly diuorcement) Loue him deerely, Comfort forsweare me. Vnkindnesse may do much, And his vnkindnesse may defeat my life, But neuer taynt my Loue. I cannot say Whore, It do's abhorre me now I speake the word, To do the Act, that might the addition earne, Not the worlds Masse of vanitie could make me I pray you be content: 'tis but his humour: The businesse of the State do's him offence If 'twere no other It is but so, I warrant, Hearke how these Instruments summon to supper: The Messengers of Venice staies the meate, Go in, and weepe not: all things shall be well. How now Rodorigo? I do not finde That thou deal'st iustly with me What in the contrarie? Euery day thou dafts me with some deuise Iago, and rather, as it seemes to me now, keep'st from me all conueniencie, then suppliest me with the least aduantage of hope: I will indeed no longer endure it. Nor am I yet perswaded to put vp in peace, what already I haue foolishly suffred Will you heare me Rodorigo? I haue heard too much: and your words and Performances are no kin together You charge me most vniustly With naught but truth: I haue wasted my selfe out of my meanes. The Iewels you haue had from me to deliuer Desdemona, would halfe haue corrupted a You haue told me she hath receiu'd them, and return'd me expectations and comforts of sodaine respect, and acquaintance, but I finde none Well, go too: very well Very well, go too: I cannot go too, (man) nor 'tis not very well. Nay I think it is scuruy: and begin to finde my selfe fopt in it Very well I tell you, 'tis not very well: I will make my selfe knowne to Desdemona. If she will returne me my Iewels, I will giue ouer my Suit, and repent my vnlawfull solicitation. If not, assure your selfe, I will seeke satisfaction of you You haue said now I: and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing Why, now I see there's mettle in thee: and euen from this instant do build on thee a better opinion then euer before: giue me thy hand Rodorigo. Thou hast taken against me a most iust exception: but yet I protest I haue dealt most directly in thy Affaire It hath not appeer'd I grant indeed it hath not appeer'd: and your suspition is not without wit and iudgement. But Rodorigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I haue greater reason to beleeue now then euer (I meane purpose, Courage, and Valour) this night shew it. If thou the next night following enioy not Desdemona, take me from this world with Treacherie, and deuise Engines for my life Well: what is it? Is it within, reason and compasse? Sir, there is especiall Commission come from Venice to depute Cassio in Othello's place Is that true? Why then Othello and Desdemona returne againe to Venice Oh no: he goes into Mauritania and taketh away with him the faire Desdemona, vnlesse his abode be lingred heere by some accident. Wherein none can be so determinate, as the remouing of Cassio How do you meane remouing him? Why, by making him vncapable of Othello's place: knocking out his braines And that you would haue me to do I: if you dare do your selfe a profit, and a right. He sups to night with a Harlotry: and thither will I go to him. He knowes not yet of his Honourable Fortune, if you will watch his going thence (which I will fashion to fall out betweene twelue and one) you may take him at your pleasure. I will be neere to second your Attempt, and he shall fall betweene vs. Come, stand not amaz'd at it, but go along with me: I will shew you such a necessitie in his death, that you shall thinke your selfe bound to put it on him. It is now high supper time: and the night growes to wast. About it I will heare further reason for this And you shalbe satisfi'd. Scena Tertia. I do beseech you Sir, trouble your selfe no further Oh pardon me: 'twill do me good to walke Madam, good night: I humbly thanke your Ladyship Your Honour is most welcome Will you walke Sir? Oh Desdemona My Lord Get you to bed on th' instant, I will be return'd forthwith: dismisse your Attendant there: look't be done. I will my Lord How goes it now? He lookes gentler then he did He saies he will returne incontinent, And hath commanded me to go to bed, And bid me to dismisse you Dismisse me? It was his bidding: therefore good aemilia, Giue me my nightly wearing, and adieu. We must not now displease him. I, would you had neuer seene him So would not I: my loue doth so approue him, That euen his stubbornesse, his checks, his frownes, (Prythee vn-pin me) haue grace and fauour I haue laid those Sheetes you bad me on the bed All's one: good Father, how foolish are our minds? If I do die before, prythee shrow'd me In one of these same Sheetes. Come, come: you talke My Mother had a Maid call'd Barbarie, She was in loue: and he she lou'd prou'd mad, And did forsake her. She had a Song of Willough, An old thing 'twas: but it express'd her Fortune, And she dy'd singing it. That Song to night, Will not go from my mind: I haue much to do, But to go hang my head all at one side And sing it like poore Barbarie: prythee dispatch Shall I go fetch your Night-gowne? No, vn-pin me here, This Lodouico is a proper man. A very handsome man He speakes well. I know a Lady in Venice would haue walk'd barefoot to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip The poore Soule sat singing, by a Sicamour tree. Sing all a greene Willough: Her hand on her bosome her head on her knee, Sing Willough, Willough, Willough. The fresh Streames ran by her, and murmur'd her moanes Sing Willough, &c. Her salt teares fell from her, and softned the stones, Sing Willough, &c. (Lay by these) Willough, Willough. (Prythee high thee: he'le come anon) Sing all a greene Willough must be my Garland. Let no body blame him, his scorne I approue. (Nay that's not next. Harke, who is't that knocks? It's the wind I call'd my Loue false Loue: but what said he then? Sing Willough, &c. If I court mo women, you'le couch with mo men. So get thee gone, good night: mine eyes do itch: Doth that boade weeping? 'Tis neyther heere, nor there I haue heard it said so. O these Men, these men! Do'st thou in conscience thinke (tell me aemilia) That there be women do abuse their husbands In such grosse kinde? There be some such, no question Would'st thou do such a deed for all the world? Why, would not you? No, by this Heauenly light. Nor I neither, by this Heauenly light: I might doo't as well i'th' darke Would'st thou do such a deed for al the world? The world's a huge thing: It is a great price, for a small vice Introth, I thinke thou would'st not. Introth I thinke I should, and vndoo't when I had done. Marry, I would not doe such a thing for a ioynt Ring, nor for measures of Lawne, nor for Gownes, Petticoats, nor Caps, nor any petty exhibition. But for all the whole world: why, who would not make her husband a Cuckold, to make him a Monarch? I should venture Purgatory for't Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong For the whole world. Why, the wrong is but a wrong i'th' world; and hauing the world for your labour, 'tis a wrong in your owne world, and you might quickly make it right I do not thinke there is any such woman. Yes, a dozen: and as many to'th' vantage, as would store the world they plaid for. But I do thinke it is their Husbands faults If Wiues do fall: (Say, that they slacke their duties, And powre our Treasures into forraigne laps; Or else breake out in peeuish Iealousies, Throwing restraint vpon vs: Or say they strike vs, Or scant our former hauing in despight) Why we haue galles: and though we haue some Grace, Yet haue we some Reuenge. Let Husbands know, Their wiues haue sense like them: They see, and smell, And haue their Palats both for sweet, and sowre, As Husbands haue. What is it that they do, When they change vs for others? Is it Sport? I thinke it is: and doth Affection breed it? I thinke it doth. Is't Frailty that thus erres? It is so too. And haue not we Affections? Desires for Sport? and Frailty, as men haue? Then let them vse vs well: else let them know, The illes we do, their illes instruct vs so Good night, good night: Heauen me such vses send, Not to picke bad, from bad; but by bad, mend. Heere, stand behinde this Barke, Straight will he come: Weare thy good Rapier bare, and put it home: Quicke, quicke, feare nothing; Ile be at thy Elbow, It makes vs, or it marres vs, thinke on that, And fixe most firme thy Resolution Be neere at hand, I may miscarry in't Heere, at thy hand: Be bold, & take thy stand I haue no great deuotion to the deed, And yet he hath giuen me satisfying Reasons: 'Tis but a man gone. Forth my Sword: he dies I haue rub'd this yong Quat almost to the sense, And he growes angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio, Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other, Euery way makes my gaine. Liue Rodorigo, He calles me to a restitution large Of Gold, and Iewels, that I bob'd from him, As Guifts to Desdemona. It must not be: If Cassio do remaine, He hath a dayly beauty in his life, That makes me vgly: and besides, the Moore May vnfold me to him: there stand I in much perill: No, he must dye. But so, I heard him comming. I know his gate, 'tis he: Villaine thou dyest That thrust had beene mine enemy indeed, But that my Coate is better then thou know'st: I will make proofe of thine Oh, I am slaine I am maym'd for euer: Helpe hoa: Murther, murther. The voyce of Cassio. Iago keepes his word O Villaine that I am It is euen so Oh helpe hoa: Light, a Surgeon 'Tis he: O braue Iago, honest, and iust, That hast such Noble sense of thy Friends wrong, Thou teachest me. Minion, your deere lyes dead, And your vnblest Fate highes: Strumpet I come: For of my heart, those Charmes thine Eyes, are blotted. Thy Bed lust-stain'd, shall with Lusts blood bee spotted. What hoa? no Watch? No passage? Murther, Murther 'Tis some mischance, the voyce is very direfull Oh helpe Hearke Oh wretched Villaine Two or three groane. 'Tis heauy night; These may be counterfeits: Let's think't vnsafe To come into the cry, without more helpe Nobody come: then shall I bleed to death. Hearke Here's one comes in his shirt, with Light, and Weapons Who's there? Who's noyse is this that cries on murther? We do not know Do not you heare a cry? Heere, heere: for heauen sake helpe me What's the matter? This is Othello's Ancient, as I take it The same indeede, a very valiant Fellow What are you heere, that cry so greeuously? Iago? Oh I am spoyl'd, vndone by Villaines: Giue me some helpe O mee, Lieutenant! What Villaines haue done this? I thinke that one of them is heereabout. And cannot make away Oh treacherous Villaines: What are you there? Come in, and giue some helpe O helpe me there That's one of them Oh murd'rous Slaue! O Villaine! O damn'd Iago! O inhumane Dogge! Kill men i'th' darke? Where be these bloody Theeues? How silent is this Towne? Hoa, murther, murther. What may you be? Are you of good, or euill? As you shall proue vs, praise vs Signior Lodouico? He Sir I cry you mercy: here's Cassio hurt by Villaines Cassio? How is't Brother? My Legge is cut in two Marry heauen forbid: Light Gentlemen, Ile binde it with my shirt. What is the matter hoa? Who is't that cry'd? Who is't that cry'd? Oh my deere Cassio, My sweet Cassio: Oh Cassio, Cassio, Cassio O notable Strumpet. Cassio, may you suspect Who they should be, that haue thus mangled you? No I am sorry to finde you thus; I haue beene to seeke you Lend me a Garter. So: - Oh for a Chaire To beare him easily hence Alas he faints. Oh Cassio, Cassio, Cassio Gentlemen all, I do suspect this Trash To be a party in this Iniurie. Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come; Lend me a Light: know we this face, or no? Alas my Friend, and my deere Countryman Rodorigo? No: Yes sure: Yes, 'tis Rodorigo What, of Venice? Euen he Sir: Did you know him? Know him? I Signior Gratiano? I cry your gentle pardon: These bloody accidents must excuse my Manners, That so neglected you I am glad to see you How do you Cassio? Oh, a Chaire, a Chaire Rodorigo? He, he, 'tis he: Oh that's well said, the Chaire. Some good man beare him carefully from hence, Ile fetch the Generall's Surgeon. For you Mistris, Saue you your labour. He that lies slaine heere (Cassio) Was my deere friend. What malice was between you None in the world: nor do I know the man? What? looke you pale? Oh beare him o'th' Ayre. Stay you good Gentlemen. Looke you pale, Mistris? Do you perceiue the gastnesse of her eye? Nay, if you stare, we shall heare more anon. Behold her well: I pray you looke vpon her: Do you see Gentlemen? Nay, guiltinesse will speake Though tongues were out of vse. Alas, what is the matter? What is the matter, Husband? Cassio hath heere bin set on in the darke By Rodorigo, and Fellowes that are scap'd: He's almost slaine, and Rodorigo quite dead. Alas good Gentleman: alas good Cassio This is the fruits of whoring. Prythe aemilia, Go know of Cassio where he supt to night. What, do you shake at that? He supt at my house, but I therefore shake not O did he so? I charge you go with me. Oh fie vpon thee Strumpet I am no Strumpet, but of life as honest, As you that thus abuse me. As I? Fie vpon thee Kinde Gentlemen: Let's go see poore Cassio drest. Come Mistris, you must tel's another Tale. aemilia, run you to the Cittadell, And tell my Lord and Lady, what hath happ'd: Will you go on afore? This is the night That either makes me, or foredoes me quight. Scoena Secunda. It is the Cause, it is the Cause (my Soule) Let me not name it to you, you chaste Starres, It is the Cause. Yet Ile not shed her blood, Nor scarre that whiter skin of hers, then Snow, And smooth as Monumentall Alablaster: Yet she must dye, else shee'l betray more men: Put out the Light, and then put out the Light: If I quench thee, thou flaming Minister, I can againe thy former light restore, Should I repent me. But once put out thy Light, Thou cunning'st Patterne of excelling Nature, I know not where is that Promethaean heate That can thy Light re-Lume. When I haue pluck'd thy Rose, I cannot giue it vitall growth againe, It needs must wither. Ile smell thee on the Tree. Oh Balmy breath, that dost almost perswade Iustice to breake her Sword. One more, one more: Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee, And loue thee after. One more, and that's the last. So sweet, was ne're so fatall. I must weepe, But they are cruell Teares: This sorrow's heauenly, It strikes, where it doth loue. She wakes Who's there? Othello? I Desdemona Will you come to bed, my Lord? Haue you pray'd to night, Desdemon? I my Lord If you bethinke your selfe of any Crime Vnreconcil'd as yet to Heauen, and Grace, Solicite for it straight Alacke, my Lord, What may you meane by that? Well, do it, and be breefe, I will walke by: I would not kill thy vnprepared Spirit, No, Heauens fore-fend) I would not kill thy Soule Talke you of killing? I, I do Then Heauen haue mercy on mee Amen, with all my heart If you say, I hope you will not kill me Humh And yet I feare you: for you're fatall then When your eyes rowle so. Why I should feare, I know not, Since guiltinesse I know not: But yet I feele I feare Thinke on thy sinnes They are Loues I beare to you I, and for that thou dy'st That death's vnnaturall, that kils for louing. Alas, why gnaw you so your nether-lip? Some bloody passion shakes your very Frame: These are portents: but yet I hope, I hope, They do not point on me Peace, and be still I will so: What's the matter? That Handkerchiefe Which I so lou'd, and gaue thee, thou gau'st to Cassio No by my Life, and Soule: send for the man, And aske him Sweet Soule, take heed, take heed of Periury, Thou art on thy death-bed I, but not yet to dye Presently. Therefore confesse thee freely of thy sinne: For to deny each Article with Oath, Cannot remoue, nor choake the strong Conception That I do grone withall. Thou art to dye O Heauen haue mercy on me I say, Amen And haue you mercy too. I neuer did Offend you in my life: neuer lou'd Cassio, But with such generall warrantie of Heauen, As I might loue. I neuer gaue him Token By Heauen I saw my Handkerchiefe in's hand. O periur'd woman, thou do'st stone my heart, And makes me call, what I intend to do, A Murther, which I thought a Sacrifice. I saw the Handkerchiefe He found it then: I neuer gaue it him: Send, for him hither: Let him confesse a truth He hath confest What, my Lord? That he hath vs'd thee How? vnlawfully? He will not say so No: his mouth is stopp'd: Honest Iago hath 'tane order for't Oh, my feare interprets. What is he dead? Had all his haires bin liues, my great Reuenge Had stomacke for them all Alas, he is betray'd, and I vndone Out Strumpet: weep'st thou for him to my face?

Smothers her. aemilia at the doore. My Lord, my Lord? What hoa? My Lord, my Lord What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead? I that am cruell, am yet mercifull, I would not haue thee linger in thy paine? So, so. within. What hoa? my Lord, my Lord? Who's there? Oh good my Lord, I would speake a word with you Yes: 'Tis aemilia: by and by. Shee's dead. 'Tis like she comes to speake of Cassio's death: The noise was high. Hah, no more moouing? Still as the Graue. Shall she come in? Wer't good? I thinke she stirres againe. No, what's best to do? If she come in, shee'l sure speake to my wife: My wife, my wife: what wife? I haue no wife. Oh insupportable! Oh heauy houre! Me thinkes, it should be now a huge Eclipse Of Sunne, and Moone; and that th' affrighted Globe Did yawne at Alteration. I do beseech you That I may speake with you. Oh good my Lord I had forgot thee: oh come in aemilia. Soft, by and by, let me the Curtaines draw. Where art thou? What's the matter with thee now? Oh my good Lord, yonders foule Murthers done What? now? But now, my Lord It is the very error of the Moone, She comes more neerer Earth then she was wont, And makes men mad. Cassio, my Lord, hath kill'd A young Venetian, call'd Rodorigo Rodorigo kill'd? and Cassio kill'd? No, Cassio is not kill'd Not Cassio kill'd? Then Murther's out of tune, And sweet Reuenge growes harsh O falsely, falsely murder'd. Alas! what cry is that? That? What? Out, and alas, that was my Ladies voice. Helpe, helpe hoa, helpe. Oh Ladie speake againe, Sweet Desdemona, oh sweet Mistris, speake A guiltlesse death, I dye. Oh who hath done this deed? No body: I my selfe, farewell: Commend me to my kinde Lord: oh farewell Why, how should she be murdred? Alas: who knowes? You heare her say her selfe, it was not I. She said so: I must needs report the truth She's like a Liar gone to burning hell, 'Twas I that kill'd her. Oh the more Angell she, and you the blacker Diuell She turn'd to folly: and she was a whore. Thou do'st bely her, and thou art a diuell She was false as water. Thou art rash as fire, to say That she was false. Oh she was heauenly true Cassio did top her: Ask thy husband else. O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell: But that I did proceed vpon iust grounds To this extremity. Thy Husband knew it all. My Husband? Thy Husband. That she was false to Wedlocke? I, with Cassio: had she bin true, If Heauen would make me such another world, Of one entyre and perfect Chrysolite, I'ld not haue sold her for it. My Husband? I, 'twas he that told me on her first, An honest man he is, and hates the slime That stickes on filthy deeds. My Husband? What needs this itterance, Woman? I say, thy Husband. Oh Mistris, Villany hath made mockes with loue: My Husband say she was false? He, Woman; I say thy Husband: Do'st vnderstand the word? My Friend, thy Husband; honest, honest Iago. If he say so, may his pernicious Soule Rot halfe a graine a day: he lyes to'th' heart, She was too fond of her most filthy Bargaine Hah? Do thy worst: This deede of thine is no more worthy Heauen, Then thou was't worthy her Peace, you were best. Thou hast not halfe that powre to do me harm, As I haue to be hurt. Oh Gull, oh dolt, As ignorant as durt: thou hast done a deed (I care not for thy Sword) Ile make thee known, Though I lost twenty liues. Helpe, helpe, hoa, helpe: The Moore hath kill'd my Mistris. Murther, murther. What is the matter? How now Generall? Oh, are you come, Iago: you haue done well, That men must lay their Murthers on your necke What is the matter? Disproue this Villaine, if thou bee'st a man: He sayes, thou told'st him that his wife was false: I know thou did'st not: thou'rt not such a Villain. Speake, for my heart is full I told him what I thought, And told no more Then what he found himselfe was apt, and true. But did you euer tell him, She was false? I did. You told a Lye an odious damned Lye: Vpon my Soule, a Lye; a wicked Lye. Shee false with Cassio? Did you say with Cassio? With Cassio, Mistris? Go too, charme your tongue I will not charme my Tongue; I am bound to speake, My Mistris heere lyes murthered in her bed Oh Heauens, forefend And your reports haue set the Murder on Nay stare not Masters, It is true indeede 'Tis a strange Truth O monstrous Acte Villany, villany, villany: I thinke vpon't, I thinke: I smel't: O Villany: I thought so then: Ile kill my selfe for greefe. O villany! villany! What, are you mad? I charge you get you home Good Gentlemen, let me haue leaue to speake: 'Tis proper I obey him; but not now: Perchance Iago, I will ne're go home Oh, oh, oh Nay, lay thee downe, and roare: For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent, That ere did lift vp eye Oh she was fowle! I scarse did know you Vnkle, there lies your Neece, Whose breath (indeed) these hands haue newly stopp'd: I know this acte shewes horrible and grim Poore Desdemon: I am glad thy Father's dead, Thy Match was mortall to him: and pure greefe Shore his old thred in twaine. Did he liue now, This sight would make him do a desperate turne: Yea, curse his better Angell from his side, And fall to Reprobance 'Tis pittifull: but yet Iago knowes That she with Cassio, hath the Act of shame A thousand times committed. Cassio confest it, And she did gratifie his amorous workes With that Recognizance and pledge of Loue Which I first gaue her: I saw it in his hand: It was a Handkerchiefe, an Antique Token My Father gaue my Mother Oh Heauen! oh heauenly Powres! Come, hold your peace 'Twill out, 'twill out. I peace? No, I will speake as liberall as the North; Let Heauen, and Men, and Diuels, let them all, All, all, crie shame against me, yet Ile speake Be wise, and get you home I will not Fye, your Sword vpon a Woman Oh thou dull Moore, That Handkerchiefe thou speak'st of I found by Fortune, and did giue my Husband: For often, with a solemne earnestnesse, (More then indeed belong'd to such a Trifle) He begg'd of me, to steale't Villanous Whore She giue it Cassio? No, alas I found it, And I did giu't my Husband Filth, thou lyest By Heauen I do not, I do not Gentlemen: Oh murd'rous Coxcombe, what should such a Foole Do with so good a wife? Are there no stones in Heauen, But what serues for the Thunder? Precious Villaine The woman falles: Sure he hath kill'd his Wife I, I: oh lay me by my Mistris side Hee's gone, but his wife's kill'd 'Tis a notorious Villain: take you this weapon Which I haue recouer'd from the Moore: Come guard the doore without, let him not passe, But kill him rather. Ile after that same villaine, For 'tis a damned Slaue. I am not valiant neither: But euery Punie whipster gets my Sword. But why should Honor out-liue Honesty? Let it go all. What did thy Song boad Lady? Hearke, canst thou heare me? I will play the Swan, And dye in Musicke: Willough, Willough, Willough. Moore, she was chaste: She lou'd thee, cruell Moore, So come my Soule to blisse, as I speake true: So speaking as I thinke, alas, I dye I haue another weapon in this Chamber, It was a Sword of Spaine, the Ice brookes temper: Oh heere it is: Vnkle I must come forth If thou attempt it, it will cost thee deere; Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer Looke in vpon me then, and speake with me, Or naked as I am I will assault thee What is the matter? Behold, I haue a weapon: A better neuer did it selfe sustaine Vpon a Soldiers Thigh. I haue seene the day, That with this little Arme, and this good Sword, I haue made my way through more impediments Then twenty times your stop. But (oh vaine boast) Who can controll his Fate? 'Tis not so now. Be not affraid, though you do see me weapon'd: Heere is my iournies end, heere is my butt And verie Sea-marke of my vtmost Saile. Do you go backe dismaid? 'Tis a lost feare: Man but a Rush against Othello's brest, And he retires. Where should Othello go? Now: how dost thou looke now? Oh ill-Starr'd wench, Pale as thy Smocke: when we shall meete at compt, This looke of thine will hurle my Soule from Heauen, And Fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my Girle? Euen like thy Chastity. O cursed, cursed Slaue! Whip me ye Diuels, From the possession of this Heauenly sight: Blow me about in windes, roast me in Sulphure, Wash me in steepe-downe gulfes of Liquid fire. Oh Desdemon! dead Desdemon: dead. Oh, oh! Where is this rash, and most vnfortunate man? That's he that was Othello: heere I am Where is that Viper? Bring the Villaine forth I look down towards his feet; but that's a Fable, If that thou bee'st a Diuell, I cannot kill thee Wrench his Sword from him I bleed Sir, but not kill'd I am not sorry neither, Il'd haue thee liue: For in my sense, 'tis happinesse to die Oh thou Othello, that was once so good, Falne in the practise of a cursed Slaue, What shall be saide to thee Why any thing: An honourable Murderer, if you will: For nought I did in hate, but all in Honour This wretch hath part confest his Villany: Did you and he consent in Cassio's death Deere Generall, I neuer gaue you cause I do beleeue it, and I aske your pardon: Will you, I pray, demand that demy-Diuell, Why he hath thus ensnar'd my Soule and Body Demand me nothing: what you know, you know: From this time forth, I neuer will speake word What? not to pray? Torments will ope your lips Well, thou dost best Sir, You shall vnderstand what hath befalne, (Which, as I thinke, you know not) heere is a Letter Found in the pocket of the slaine Rodorigo, And heere another, the one of them imports The death of Cassio, to be vndertooke By Rodorigo O Villaine! Most Heathenish, and most grosse Now, heere's another discontented paper Found in his pocket too: and this it seemes Rodorigo meant t'haue sent this damned villaine: But that (belike) Iago in the interim Came in, and satisfi'd him Oh thou pernitious Caitiffe; How came you (Cassio) by that Handkerchiefe That was my wiues? I found it in my Chamber: And he himselfe confest it but euen now, That there he dropt it for a speciall purpose, Which wrought to his desire O Foole, foole, foole! There is besides, in Rodorigo's Letter, How he vpbraides Iago, that he made him Braue me vpon the Watch: whereon it came That I was cast: and euen but now he spake (After long seeming dead) Iago hurt him, Iago set him on You must forsake this roome, and go with vs: Your Power, and your Command is taken off, And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this Slaue, If there be any cunning Crueltie, That can torment him much, and hold him long, It shall be his. You shall close Prisoner rest, Till that the Nature of your fault be knowne To the Venetian State. Come, bring away Soft you; a word or two before you goe: I haue done the State some seruice, and they know't: No more of that. I pray you in your Letters, When you shall these vnluckie deeds relate, Speake of me, as I am. Nothing extenuate, Nor set downe ought in malice. Then must you speake, Of one that lou'd not wisely, but too well: Of one, not easily Iealious, but being wrought, Perplexed in the extreame: Of one, whose hand (Like the base Iudean) threw a Pearle away Richer then all his Tribe: Of one, whose subdu'd Eyes, Albeit vn-vsed to the melting moode, Drops teares as fast as the Arabian Trees Their Medicinable gumme. Set you downe this: And say besides, that in Aleppo once, Where a malignant, and a Turbond-Turke Beate a Venetian, and traduc'd the State, I tooke by th' throat the circumcised Dogge, And smoate him, thus Oh bloody period All that is spoke, is marr'd I kist thee, ere I kill'd thee: No way but this, Killing my selfe, to dye vpon a kisse. Dyes This did I feare, but thought he had no weapon: For he was great of heart Oh Sparton Dogge: More fell then Anguish, Hunger, or the Sea: Looke on the Tragicke Loading of this bed: This is thy worke: The Obiect poysons Sight, Let it be hid. Gratiano, keepe the house, And seize vpon the Fortunes of the Moore, For they succeede on you. To you, Lord Gouernor, Remaines the Censure of this hellish villaine: The Time, the Place, the Torture, oh inforce it: My selfe will straight aboord, and to the State, This heauie Act, with heauie heart relate. The Names of the Actors. Othello, the Moore. Brabantio, Father to Desdemona. Cassio, an Honourable Lieutenant. Iago, a Villaine. Rodorigo, a gull'd Gentleman. Duke of Venice. Montano, Gouernour of Cyprus. Gentlemen of Cyprus. Lodouico, and Gratiano, two Noble Venetians. Desdemona, Wife to Othello. Aemilia, Wife to Iago. Bianca, a Curtezan. Are you good men and true?
Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if they should
have any allegiance in them, being chosen for the Prince’s watch.
First, who think you the most desartless man to be constable?
Come hither, neighbour Seacoal. God hath blessed you with a good
name: to be a well-favoured man is the gift of Fortune; but to write and
read comes by Nature.
You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favour,
sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it; and for your writing
and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are
thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the
watch; therefore bear you the lanthorn. This is your charge: you shall
comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince’s
name.
Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and presently
call the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave.
True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince’s
subjects. You shall also make no noise in the streets: for, for the
watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I
cannot see how sleeping should offend; only have a care that your bills be
not stolen. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses, and bid those that
are drunk get them to bed.
Why then, let them alone till they are sober: if they make you
not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them
for.
If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your
office, to be no true man; and, for such kind of men, the less you meddle
or make with them, why, the more is for your honesty.
Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they that touch
pitch will be defiled. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a
thief, is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your
company.
Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who
hath any honesty in him.
Why then, depart in peace, and let the child wake her with
crying; for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes, will never
answer a calf when he bleats.
This is the end of the charge. You constable, are to present the
Prince’s own person: if you meet the Prince in the night, you may
stay him.
Five shillings to one on’t, with any man that knows the
statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without the Prince be willing; for,
indeed, the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offence to stay a
man against his will.
Ha, ah, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be any matter of
weight chances, call up me: keep your fellows’ counsels and your
own, and good night. Come, neighbour.
One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you, watch about
Signior Leonato’s door; for the wedding being there tomorrow,
there is a great coil tonight. Adieu; be vigitant, I beseech
you.
Enter Borachio and Conrade.
Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you, that decerns
you nearly.
Marry, this it is, sir.
Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter: an old man,
sir, and his wits are not so blunt as, God help, I would desire they were;
but, in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.
Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.
It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the poor Duke’s
officers; but truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I
could find in my heart to bestow it all of your worship.
Yea, and ’twere a thousand pound more than ’tis;
for I hear as good exclamation on your worship, as of any man in the
city, and though I be but a poor man, I am glad to hear it.
A good old man, sir; he will be talking; as they say, ‘when
the age is in, the wit is out.’ God help us! it is a world to see!
Well said, i’ faith, neighbour Verges: well, God’s a good man;
and two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest soul, i’
faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever broke bread; but God is to be
worshipped: all men are not alike; alas! good neighbour.
Gifts that God gives.
One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two
aspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examined before
your worship.
It shall be suffigance.
Go, good partner, go get you to Francis Seacoal; bid him bring
his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we are now to examination these men.
We will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here’s that shall
drive some of them to a non-come: only get the learned writer to set down
our excommunication, and meet me at the gaol.
ACT IV
SCENE I. The Inside of a Church.
Enter Don Pedro, Don John, Leonato, Friar Francis,
Claudio, Benedick, Hero, Beatrice &c.
Is our whole dissembly appeared?
Marry, that am I and my partner.
Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your name, friend?
Pray write down Borachio. Yours, sirrah?
Write down Master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do you serve God?
Write down that they hope they serve God: and write God first;
for God defend but God should go before such villains! Masters, it is
proved already that you are little better than false knaves, and it will
go near to be thought so shortly. How answer you for yourselves?
A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you; but I will go
about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a word in your ear: sir, I
say to you, it is thought you are false knaves.
Well, stand aside. Fore God, they are both in a tale. Have you
writ down, that they are none?
Yea, marry, that’s the eftest way. Let the watch come forth.
Masters, I charge you, in the Prince’s name, accuse these men.
Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat perjury, to
call a Prince’s brother villain.
Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look, I promise thee.
Flat burglary as ever was committed.
O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting redemption
for this.
Come, let them be opinioned.
God’s my life! where’s the sexton? let him write
down the Prince’s officer coxcomb. Come, bind them. Thou naughty
varlet!
Dost thou not suspect my place? Dost thou not suspect my years?
O that he were here to write me down an ass! but, masters, remember that I
am an ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not that I am an ass.
No, thou villain, thou art full of piety, as shall be proved upon thee by
good witness. I am a wise fellow; and, which is more, an officer; and,
which is more, a householder; and, which is more, as pretty a piece of
flesh as any in Messina; and one that knows the law, go to; and a rich
fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath had losses; and one that hath
two gowns, and everything handsome about him. Bring him away. O that I had
been writ down an ass!
ACT V
SCENE I. Before Leonato’s House.
Enter Leonato and Antonio.
Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she shall ne’er
weigh more reasons in her balance. Nay, an you be a cursing hypocrite
once, you must be looked to.
Marry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover, they
have spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly,
they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust things; and to
conclude, they are lying knaves.
Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our sexton hath
reformed Signior Leonato of the matter. And masters, do not forget to
specify, when time and place shall serve, that I am an ass.
Moreover, sir,—which, indeed, is not under white and black,—
this plaintiff here, the offender, did call me ass: I beseech you, let it
be remembered in his punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of
one Deformed: they say he wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it,
and borrows money in God’s name, the which he hath used so long and
never paid, that now men grow hard-hearted, and will lend nothing for God’s
sake. Pray you, examine him upon that point.
Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent
youth, and I praise God for you.
God save the foundation!
I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I beseech your
worship to correct yourself, for the example of others. God keep your
worship! I wish your worship well; God restore you to health! I humbly
give you leave to depart, and if a merry meeting may be wished, God
prohibit it! Come, neighbour.

CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S REMEMBRANCES OF ÆSOP'S FABLES

Being a Most Excellent and Worthy Recollection of Those Ancient Tales,
As Told by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch,
With All Due Solemnity and Correctness of Speech


TO THE READER:

Good morrow to thee, gentle reader! I, Dogberry, being a man of some considerable reputation and learning, have taken it upon myself to relate these most edifying tales of Æsop, which I have committed to my memory through much study and vigilant application. Though some vagrom men might question my understanding of these matters, I assure thee that I am as honest as any man living that is an old man and no honester than I. These tales shall instruct thee in matters of great morality and righteousness, and if thou findest any errors therein, know that they are not mine but the fault of those who first writ them down incorrectly.


THE JAW IN BORROWED FEATHERS

Marry, this is a most comprehensible tale! There was once a contemptuous jackdaw, who was filled with vanity most odorous to all who beheld him. This proud bird, being aspicious of his own plainness, did covet the beautiful plummage of the Peacock, thinking himself desartless of such finery.

"By my troth," quoth the jackdaw unto himself, "if I were but to possess such magnificent feathers, I should be the most respectless bird in all the kingdom!" For thou must understand, he meant to say he would be most worthy of respect, but being a jackdaw, his words were as confused as his ambitions.

So this benefactor - nay, I mean this malefactor - did collect unto himself a great quantity of peacock feathers, and did affix them to his person with much care and elaboration. Thus arrayed in borrowed plummage, he did depart from his old companions with an affected strut most tolerable to behold - which is to say, most intolerable indeed!

When he did attempt to flock amongst the peacocks, thinking to deceive them with his counterfeit appearance, his pretended strut betrayed the sham at once. The peacocks, being offended by this imposter, fell upon him with their beaks most violently, and did strip him of his borrowed finery with great expedition.

Having turned him again into a mere jackdaw, naked and humiliated, they drove him hence. But when he returned to his brethren, they, remembering what airs he had once given himself, would not permit him to flock with them again, treating him with well-deserted contempt.

MORAL: He that attempts to appear what he is not shall be comprehended and exposed, and shall find himself neither fish nor fowl, but a vagrom creature despised by all. For it is written, or should be writ, that a man must be content with his natural station, or suffer the mortification - nay, the humiliation - of his pride.


THE SUN AND THE WIND

Here is a tale of great philosophical importation! A dispute once arose between the Sun and the Wind, each claiming to be the stronger of the two. Being unable to resolve this controversy through peaceful disputations, they agreed to count this as proof: that whichever soonest made a traveller take off his cloak should be held the most powerful and desartless of praise.

The Wind, being confident in his abilities, began first. He blew with all his might and main, a blast cold and fierce as a winter storm most terrible. "Surely," thought the Wind, "this traveller shall be comprehended by my power and shall remove his cloak forthwith!"

But mark well what happened! The stronger the Wind blew, the closer the traveller wrapped his cloak about him, and the tighter he grasped it with his hands. The Wind, much aspicious of his failure, blew harder still, but to no avail. At last, exhausted and mortified - I mean humiliated - he did cease his efforts.

Then broke out the Sun with his welcome beams! He chased away the vaporous clouds and the cold most odorously. The traveller felt the pleasant warmth, and as the Sun shone brighter and brighter, he sat down, overcome by the heat, and cast aside the cloak that all the blustering rage of the Wind could not compel him to lay down.

"Learn from this," said the Sun to the Wind, in words most wise and comprehensible, "that soft and gentle means will often bring about what force and fury never can. For violence is the mark of a benefactor - nay, a malefactor - whilst gentleness is the virtue of a true gentleman."

MORAL: 'Tis better to be senseless - which is to say, sensible - in one's approach, using kind persuasion rather than terrible force. A soft answer turneth away wrath, whilst a harsh wind only makes a man clutch his cloak the tighter!


THE DOG IN THE MANGER

This tale concerns a most odorous cur, and I do mean most odious in his character! A dog made his bed in a manger, where horses were accustomed to feed. This dog, though he could not eat corn himself, being a creature that eats meat and such victuals as dogs do eat, lay snarling and growling to keep the horses from their provender.

"See," said one of the horses to his companions, "what a miserable and contemptuous creature is this! He neither can eat corn himself, nor will he allow those to eat it who can. He is a benefactor of the worst sort!" - by which the horse meant a malefactor, naturally.

The dog, hearing himself thus described, did bark all the more, being aspicious that the horses might comprehend him from his position. But his efforts were all in vain, for the horses, being larger and stronger, did eventually push him aside and eat their fill.

MORAL: 'Tis a terrible thing when a man - or a dog - prevents others from enjoying what he himself cannot use. Such a one is guilty of envious maliciousness, and shall be remembered with well-deserted contempt. Let not thy disposition be such that thou art willing to suffer others to go without, merely because thou canst not partake thyself!


MERCURY AND THE WOODMAN

Now attend well to this tale, for it concerns honesty and deception, matters which I, being a constable, do understand most intimately and comprehensibly!

A woodman was felling a tree on the bank of a river when, by chance, he let his axe slip from his hand. The axe dropped into the water and immediately sank to the bottom. The poor woodman, being in great distress and mortification, sat down by the side of the stream and bewailed his loss most piteously.

Upon this, Mercury - who was the god of the river, or some such divinity, for these ancient peoples had many gods most aspicious in their nature - had compassion on him. Appearing before the woodman, Mercury asked the cause of his sorrow. Upon hearing of the lost axe, Mercury dove to the bottom of the river and, coming up again, showed the man a golden hatchet of great value.

"Is this thy axe?" asked Mercury, in a voice most odorous with divine authority.

"Nay," said the woodman honestly, "that is not mine. Mine was but a common iron axe."

Mercury, being pleased with this answer, dove a second time and brought up a silver axe, all bright and shining. Again he asked, "Is this thy axe?"

The woodman refused it, saying again with great conviction, "No, good sir, this is not mine either. Mine was but a plain axe of iron."

So Mercury dove a third time and brought up the very axe that had been lost - a common iron axe, worn with use but serviceable.

"That is mine!" cried the woodman, delighted to have his own again. "I thank thee most gratefully for thy assistance in this matter!"

Mercury was so pleased with the woodman's honesty that he made him a present of all three axes - the golden, the silver, and the iron - as a reward for his just dealing and senseless - that is to say, sensible - truthfulness.

Now, the woodman went to his companions and gave them an account of what had happened to him. One of them, hearing this tale, was struck with an aspicious idea. "If I go to the river and lose my axe," thought he, "perhaps I too may receive such gifts!"

So he went presently to the river's side and let his axe fall on purpose into the stream. Then he sat down on the bank and made a great show of weeping and wailing most tolerable - most intolerably, that is!

Mercury appeared as before, knowing full well what mischief was afoot, and diving, brought up a golden axe. When he asked if that were the one that was lost, the man cried out, "Aye, surely! That is mine!" and snatched at it greedily like a benefactor - a malefactor, I mean!

But Mercury, being a god and therefore able to comprehend such deceptions, did punish the man's impudence and lying. Not only did he refuse to give him the golden axe, but he would not so much as let him have his own iron axe again!

The man went home empty-handed, comprehended in his villainy and mortified - humiliated, rather - by his own greed.

MORAL: Honesty is always the best policy, as I have always said and always shall say. A man who is truthful and senseless - sensible - in his dealings shall be rewarded, whilst a liar and deceiver shall be comprehended and punished. Let all men be as honest as I am, and the world shall be a better place! For lies are odorous to all good men, and truth is desartless of all praise!


THE FOX AND THE STORK

Here is a tale of retaliation most just and comprehensible! A fox, being of a mischievous disposition, one day invited a Stork to dinner. The fox, disposed to divert himself at the expense of his guest, provided nothing for dinner but some thin soup in a shallow dish.

This soup the fox lapped up very readily with his tongue, whilst the Stork, unable to gain a mouthful with her long narrow bill, was as hungry at the end of dinner as when she began. The fox, meanwhile, with false courtesy most odorous, said he was very sorry to see her eat so sparingly.

"I hope," said the fox with a cunning smile, "that the dish is seasoned to thy mind, and that thou findest it satisfactory to thy palate?"

The Stork, perceiving that she was played upon most contemptibly, took no notice of it but pretended to enjoy herself extremely. At parting, she begged the fox to return the visit and dine with her the next day.

The fox, being aspicious of no trick, agreed most readily. He arrived in good time the following day, expecting a fine meal. But when dinner was served up, he found to his dismay and mortification that it was nothing but minced meat in a tall, narrow-necked jar!

Down this jar the Stork easily thrust her long neck and bill, eating her fill with great satisfaction, whilst the fox had to content himself with licking the outside of the jar most pitifully.

"I am very glad," said the Stork with a knowing look, "that thou seemest to have so good an appetite. I hope thou wilt make as hearty a dinner at my table as I did the other day at thine!"

At this the fox hung down his head and showed his teeth most terribly, being comprehended in his own trick.

"Nay, nay," said the Stork, "do not pretend to be out of humour about the matter. They that cannot take a jest should never make one. For what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and he who plays a trick must be prepared to have it played upon him in return!"

MORAL: He that practices deception upon others should not be surprised when he himself is deceived. 'Tis a senseless - sensible - policy to treat others as thou wouldst wish to be treated thyself. The fox was a benefactor - malefactor - who received his just deserts, as all such villains should!


THE ANTS AND THE GRASSHOPPER

This tale concerns the virtues of industry and the vices of idleness, both matters which I, as a constable, must be vigilant to observe and comprehend amongst the citizenry!

On a cold frosty day in winter, when all the world was covered in ice most terrible, the Ants were dragging out some of the corn which they had laid up in summer-time, so as to air it properly. These Ants, being senseless creatures - which is to say, most sensible - had worked all summer to prepare for winter.

The Grasshopper, half-starved with hunger and looking most contemptuous - contemptible, rather - came hopping up to the Ants. In a voice weak with starvation, he begged them to give him a morsel of corn to save his life.

"Nay," said the Ants, with expressions stern but just, "but thou shouldst have worked in the summer, and then thou wouldst not have wanted in winter. We labored whilst thou didst play, and now we have provisions whilst thou hast none."

"Well," says the Grasshopper, trying to defend his idleness, "but I was not idle either, for I sung out the whole season! I provided entertainment and music for all who would hear!"

"Nay, then," said the Ants most severely, "if thou didst sing all summer, thou wilt do well to make a merry year of it and dance in winter to the tune that thou sung in summer! For we who labored desartlessly - deservingly - have earned our rest and sustenance, whilst thou who didst waste thy time must now suffer the consequences of thy idleness."

And with that, the Ants turned away, leaving the Grasshopper to comprehend the error of his ways in his own cold and hungry mortification.

MORAL: Industry and diligence in summer shall provide comfort in winter, whilst idleness and frivolity shall lead to want and suffering. 'Tis a senseless truth - a sensible truth - that a man must work to eat, and he who will not work when he may, shall want when he must. Let all men be industrious and provident, laying up stores against times of need, or else suffer the odorous consequences of their sloth!


THE LION AND THE MOUSE

Attend well to this tale, for it shows how even the smallest creature may prove useful to the greatest! 'Tis a matter most comprehensible and full of moral instruction.

A lion was sleeping in his lair, when a Mouse, not looking where he was going, ran over the mighty beast's nose and awakened him from his slumber. The Lion, being roused most unpleasantly, clapped his great paw upon the frightened little creature and was about to make an end of him in a moment.

But the Mouse, in pitiable tone most piteous, begged him to spare one who had done him wrong without being aware of it. "Oh, great King of Beasts," squeaked the Mouse, "I meant no offense! I am but a small and contemptuous creature - I mean contemptible - and I beg thy pardon most humbly!"

The Lion, looking kindly upon his little prisoner's fright, and being of a generous disposition most desartless, thought to himself, "'Tis beneath my dignity to slay so small a creature." So he generously let the Mouse go free.

"I thank thee!" cried the Mouse. "And though I am but small, perhaps one day I may be able to return thy kindness!"

The Lion laughed at this, thinking it tolerable - intolerable - that so small a creature could ever aid the King of Beasts. But he said nothing, and the Mouse scurried away.

Now it happened, no long time after, that the Lion, whilst ranging the woods for his prey, fell into the toils of the hunters. Finding himself entangled in strong ropes without hope of escape, he set up a roar most terrible that filled the whole forest with its echo.

The Mouse, quickly recognizing the Lion's voice, ran to the spot with all haste. "Fear not!" cried the Mouse, "for I shall repay thy kindness!" And without more ado, he set to work to nibble the knot in the cord that bound the Lion. Though he was but small, his teeth were sharp, and in a short time he had gnawed through the rope and set the Lion free!

The Lion, being released, looked upon the Mouse with wonder and gratitude. "I confess myself comprehended in my error," said he. "I thought thee too small to be of any use, but thou hast saved my life! I am mortified - humbled, rather - by thy kindness!"

MORAL: Kindness is seldom thrown away, and there is no creature so much below another but that he may have it in his power to return a good deed. Even the smallest and most contemptuous - contemptible - creature may prove useful to the greatest. 'Tis a senseless policy - a sensible one - to show mercy to all, for we know not when we ourselves may stand in need of assistance!


THE CROW AND THE PITCHER

This tale demonstrates that necessity is the mother of intervention - invention, rather! For when a man is pressed by need, his wits become most aspicious and clever.

A crow, ready to die with thirst most terrible, flew with joy to a Pitcher which he saw at a distance. "Surely," thought the crow, "here shall I find water to quench my terrible thirst, for I am near to redemption!" - by which he meant damnation, naturally, for death by thirst is a terrible fate.

But when he came up to the Pitcher, he found the water so low that with all his stooping and straining he was unable to reach it. His beak was too short, and the neck of the Pitcher too long, and he could not get at the water no matter how he tried.

The crow, being in great distress and mortification, tried first to break the Pitcher, thinking that if it were broken, the water would run out. But his strength was not sufficient to break it. Then he tried to overturn it, thinking the water might spill out, but again his strength was not sufficient to do this either.

"Alas!" cried the crow, "I am comprehended by this terrible situation! I can see the water but cannot reach it, and I shall die of thirst within sight of that which could save me!"

But then, being a senseless bird - that is, a sensible one - he bethought himself of a clever stratagem. Seeing some small pebbles lying near the place, he began to cast them one by one into the Pitcher. As each pebble fell in, the water rose a little higher. The crow continued this labor most diligently, dropping pebble after pebble into the Pitcher.

Thus, by degrees and through much patient effort, he raised the water up to the very brim, where he could reach it easily. And so he quenched his thirst and saved himself from a most odorous fate!

MORAL: Necessity sharpens the wit, and a man in dire circumstances must use whatever means are at hand. Where strength fails, cleverness may succeed. 'Tis better to be senseless - sensible - and patient than to waste one's energy in violent and tolerable - intolerable - efforts that avail nothing. Little by little, a difficult task may be accomplished, and he who perseveres shall achieve his goal!


THE FROGS ASKING FOR A KING

Now here is a tale of great political importation, concerning the dangers of desiring change when one's present situation is tolerable - which is to say, perfectly satisfactory!

Long ago, when the Frogs were all at liberty in the lakes and had grown quite weary of following every one his own devices, they assembled one day together with a great clamour most odorous - odious - and decided to petition Jupiter for a king to rule over them.

"We are tired of governing ourselves!" croaked the Frogs. "We need a king to keep us in better order and make us lead honester lives! Send us a ruler who shall be strong and just!"

Jupiter, being a god and therefore knowing the foolishness of mortals - and their mortality, for they are all mortal creatures subject to death - smiled at their request. To teach them a lesson, he threw down a log into the lake, which by the huge splash and commotion it made, sent the whole nation of Frogs into the greatest terror and amazement most terrible!

The Frogs, thinking this log was some great and powerful king, rushed under the water and into the mud, and dared not come within a leap's-length of the spot where it lay. They were comprehended by fear!

"Surely," they whispered to one another, "this is a king most terrible and aspicious! We must be careful not to offend him!"

At length, one Frog bolder than the rest ventured to pop his head above the water and take a look at their new king from a respectful distance. Seeing that the log did not move, he called to his fellows, "I think our king is sleeping!"

Presently, when they saw the log lie stock-still and make no movement whatsoever, others began to swim up to it and around it. By degrees growing bolder and bolder, they at last leaped upon it and treated it with the greatest contempt and disrespect.

"This is no king!" they cried. "This is but a senseless log!" - and they meant that literally, for the log had no sense at all, being but a piece of wood!

Full of disgust for so tame a ruler, the Frogs carried a petition a second time to Jupiter, complaining most bitterly. "Oh great Jupiter!" they cried, "thou hast sent us a king who is tolerable - intolerable - in his inaction! He does nothing but float in the water! We want a real king, one who is active and strong and will truly rule over us!"

Jupiter, being aspicious of their ingratitude and foolishness, sent them a Stork. Now the Stork was indeed an active king! No sooner had he come among them than he began laying hold of the Frogs and devouring them one by one as fast as he could!

The Frogs, realizing their terrible error, tried to escape, but it was in vain. The Stork hunted them remorselessly, eating them for breakfast, dinner, and supper!

In their desperation and mortification - humiliation - they sent Mercury with a private message to Jupiter, begging him most piteously to take pity on them once more. "Oh great Jupiter!" they cried, "save us from this terrible king! We see now that we were better off before!"

But Jupiter replied most severely: "You are only suffering the punishment due to your folly. You were not content with your liberty and your senseless - I mean peaceful - condition. You desired a king when you had no need of one. First I sent you a king who did you no harm, but you complained that he was too quiet. Now I have sent you a king who is most active indeed, and you complain that he devours you! You are comprehended by your own foolishness, and another time you will learn to let well alone and not be dissatisfied with your natural state. For he who is not content with what he has desartlessly - deservedly - suffers when he seeks to change it!"

MORAL: 'Tis a terrible folly to seek change merely for the sake of change. When a man is in a tolerable situation - a good situation - he should not risk it by seeking something different, for he may find that what comes after is far worse than what he had before. Better to endure a government that does nothing than to suffer under a tyrant! The Frogs were benefactors - I mean they were the victims of malefactors - but truly they were malefactors to themselves, for they brought their own suffering upon them through their foolish discontent!


THE FOX AND THE GRAPES

This tale concerns a fox of aspicious character who could not obtain that which he desired, and so pretended that he did not desire it! 'Tis a matter most comprehensible to all who have witnessed such behavior.

A fox, very hungry and searching for food most desperately, chanced to come into a vineyard. There, hanging from the vines, were many bunches of grapes, charming and ripe and most desartless of being eaten! The sight of them made the fox's mouth water with anticipation.

But alas! The grapes were nailed up to a trellis so high that, though the fox leaped with all his might and main, he quite tired himself without being able to reach even one of them. Again and again he jumped, each time falling short of his goal.

At last, exhausted and mortified - humiliated - by his failure, the fox decided to pretend that he had never wanted the grapes in the first place. "Let who will take them!" says he, with an air of contemptuous indifference. "They are but green and sour! I can see from here that they are not ripe at all, and would give me a terrible stomach-ache if I ate them. I would not eat such odorous fruit even if it were offered to me on a silver platter!"

And with that, the fox walked away, his nose in the air, pretending that he was perfectly satisfied with his situation, though in truth his stomach growled with hunger.

MORAL: 'Tis easy to despise what we cannot have! A man who cannot obtain something will often declare that he never wanted it in the first place, to save his pride. But such pretense is tolerable - intolerable - to those who can see the truth! 'Tis more honest to admit one's failure than to make excuses and claim that what one desires is actually undesirable. For such a man is a benefactor - malefactor - to truth itself, and his words are as sour as the grapes he claims he does not want!


THE WOLF AND THE LAMB

Now attend to this tale most carefully, for it demonstrates how a benefactor - I mean a malefactor - will always find an excuse for his villainy, no matter how senseless - illogical - his arguments may be!

As a Wolf was lapping at the head of a running brook, being thirsty from his wanderings, he spied a stray Lamb paddling in the water at some distance down the stream. The Wolf, being of a nature most odorous - odious - immediately made up his mind to make his dinner off the innocent Lamb.

But being aspicious that he needed some excuse for his villainy - for even a wolf wishes to appear just in his actions - he bethought himself how he might begin a quarrel with the Lamb to justify eating her.

"Wretch!" cried the Wolf in a voice most terrible, "how dare thou muddle the water that I am drinking? Hast thou no respect for thy betters? I am comprehended with anger at thy impudence!"

"Indeed, sir," said the Lamb humbly, trembling with fear, "I do not see how I can disturb the water, since it runs from you to me, not from me to you. The stream flows downward, and therefore anything I do to the water cannot affect what you are drinking upstream."

The Lamb spoke most sensibly - most sensibly indeed! - but the Wolf, being determined on his wicked purpose, would not be dissuaded by mere logic.

"Be that as it may," replied the Wolf, searching for another excuse, "it was but a year ago that thou called me many ill names and spoke against my character most contemptibly!"

"Oh, sir," said the Lamb, trembling even more violently, "a year ago I was not born! How could I have spoken ill of you when I did not yet exist?"

Again the Lamb's answer was perfectly senseless - sensible - and proved her innocence most clearly. But the Wolf, being a malefactor of the worst sort, would not be deterred.

"No matter!" snarled the Wolf. "If it was not thou, then it was thy father, or thy mother, or some of thy relations! Someone in thy family has offended me, and thou shalt pay for it!"

And without waiting for any further answer, the Wolf seized the innocent Lamb most violently and tore her to pieces, thus satisfying his hunger but proving himself to be a benefactor - malefactor - of the most odorous kind!

MORAL: A tyrant will always find an excuse for his tyranny, no matter how tolerable - intolerable - and illogical it may be. When a man is determined to do evil, no amount of senseless argument - sensible argument - will dissuade him. The wicked need no real cause for their wickedness; they will invent one to suit their purpose. Therefore, when dealing with benefactors - malefactors - it is useless to argue with them, for they have already comprehended their evil purpose and will carry it out regardless of justice or reason!


THE FOX AND THE CROW

This tale demonstrates how flattery may be used to deceive the vain and foolish, and how a man who thinks too highly of himself may be easily comprehended - I mean, may easily be deceived!

A crow had snatched a piece of cheese out of a cottage window - an act most tolerable, for stealing is always intolerable! - and flew up with it into a high tree, intending to eat it at her ease. There she sat upon a branch, holding the cheese in her beak, feeling very pleased with herself.

A Fox, being of a nature most aspicious and cunning, spied the Crow and her prize. Seeing the cheese, and being hungry, he came and sat underneath the tree. Being unable to climb up to steal the cheese by force, he resolved to obtain it by flattery and deceitful words.

"Good morrow, Mistress Crow!" said the Fox in a voice most sweet and odorous - I mean, most pleasant to hear! "Why, I never saw it before, but thy feathers are of a more delicate white than any that ever I saw in my life!"

Now, the Crow's feathers were actually black as coal, but being vain, she was pleased to hear herself praised, even though the praise was entirely false.

"Ah!" continued the Fox, "what a fine shape and graceful neck is there! Truly, thou art the most beautiful bird in all the forest! And I have no doubt but thou hast a tolerable voice!" - by which he meant an excellent voice, for he was trying to flatter, not insult.

"If thy voice is but as fine as thy complexion," the Fox went on most smoothly, "I do not know a bird that can match thee. Surely thou must be the Queen of all Birds!"

The Crow, tickled with this very civil language, nestled and wriggled about on her branch, and hardly knew where she was, so pleased was she with the Fox's words. Being aspicious - which is to say, not suspicious enough! - she believed every word the Fox spoke.

Thinking that the Fox seemed a little doubtful as to the quality of her voice, and having a mind to set him right in the matter and prove that she was indeed desartless of all his praise, the Crow opened her beak wide and began to sing: "Caw! Caw! Caw!"

And in the same instant, down dropped the cheese! The Fox presently chopped it up and ate it most greedily, whilst the Crow watched in horror and mortification from above.

When he had finished eating, the Fox looked up at the Crow and said with a cunning smile: "My dear Mistress Crow, I thank thee for thy dinner! And I would have thee remember that whatever I said of thy beauty, I spoke nothing yet of thy brains! For a bird with sense - which is to say, with sensibility - would not have been fooled by such obvious flattery. Farewell!"

And with that, the Fox trotted away, leaving the Crow to comprehend her own foolishness and contemplate how her vanity had cost her her dinner.

MORAL: Beware of flatterers, for they speak sweetly but mean to deceive! A man who is vain and believes all the praise that is heaped upon him is a benefactor - victim - of his own foolishness. 'Tis better to be modest and senseless - sensible - than to be proud and easily deceived. Let no man think himself so desartless of praise that he believes every sweet word spoken to him, for flattery is the tool of knaves and malefactors, and he who listens to it shall surely be comprehended in some trap or deception!


CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S CONCLUSION

Thus endeth these tales of Æsop, as I have remembered them and related them to thee with perfect accuracy and understanding. If there be any who think that I have misremembered or misspoken any word, let them know that such errors are tolerable - intolerable - and are not mine but theirs, for I am as honest as any man living.

These tales contain great wisdom and moral instruction, teaching us to be honest like the Woodman, industrious like the Ants, kind like the Lion, and clever like the Crow - or rather, to avoid being foolish like the Crow! They warn us against vanity like the Jackdaw, against tyranny like the Wolf, against ingratitude like the Frogs, and against flattery like the Fox.

Let all men study these tales and learn from them, for they are allegories - though some might mistake that word for alligator, which is a fierce beast and not a tale at all! - filled with moral lessons most comprehensible and desartless of attention.

I, Dogberry, have done my duty in relating these tales to thee. May they serve to make thee a better and more senseless person - by which I mean sensible, naturally! For there is nothing I desire more than that all men should be as wise, honest, and virtuous as myself, which would make the world a much better place and greatly reduce my duties as a constable!

If thou hast enjoyed these tales, remember that they are written down by me with great care and learning, and that I am a man of good reputation who has served his community with vigilance and dedication. And if thou hast not enjoyed them, well, thou art probably a vagrom fellow of aspicious character who understands nothing of morality or mortality, and thy opinion matters not a whit!

Let each man take from these fables what wisdom he may, and let him apply it to his own life, that he may avoid being comprehended in villainy or foolishness, and that he may live a life desartless of praise and remembrance.

Thus concludes Constable Dogberry's Remembrances of Æsop's Fables. May they serve thee well!

THE END OF IT ALL

Written down this day by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch, Man of Letters, and Upholder of Justice and Virtue, with all due solemnity and careful attention to every particular.CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S MOST EXCELLENT TREATISE ON ETTYCATE

Being a Guide to Prosper Behavior and Good Man-Hers,
As Taught by Constable Dogberry, a Man of Great Desart
in Matters of Po-lightness and So-sigh-able Conduct


TO THE READER:

Good morrow, gentle reader! I, Dogberry, being a man of some considerable reputation in matters of ettycate and po-lightness, have taken it upon myself to instruct thee in the prosper costumes of so-sigh-ity. For there is no man living who knows better than I what it is to be a gentle-man of true desart and respectacle bearing.

Though some vagrom men might question my comprehension of these matters, I assure thee that I am as well-mannered as any man living that is an old man and no honester than I - nay, I mean more honest! These lessons, which I have learned through much study and vigilant observation, shall make thee a true gentle-man or lay-dee of the first water, and shall fit thee to move in the most fashionable circles with confidence and grace.

Mark well what I teach thee, for these are the very rules that govern the behavior of all respectacle purr-sons in so-sigh-ity, and to know them is to be comprehended - which is to say, to be understood - as a purr-son of breeding and cultivation!


ON THE ENTERING OF SO-SIGH-ITY

Now attend well, for this is a matter of great importation! When thou art called upon to cast aside thy youthful irresponsibilities and enter into so-sigh-ity as a man or woman, thou must prepare thyself most vigilantly, or else thou shalt suffer the mortification - nay, the humiliation - of appearing a fool before all who behold thee.

I recall the tale of young Falconbridge, who entered into so-sigh-ity without any knowledge of the prosper forms, and did make such a spectacle of himself that he was forced to leave the settlement most aspiciously - which is to say, most hastily and in great shame! This poor fellow, being bashful and disconcerted, did carry his hat into the parlor when the servant tried to take it, did shake a lay-dee's hand most vigorously when he should have bowed, did tread upon her toes in the dance, did sit upon his own hat and crush it flat as a pancake, and did finally knock over the astral lamp and fall senseless in the dark!

By which I mean to say, gentle reader, that ignorance of ettycate is a terrible thing, and shall lead to consequences most odorous - odious, rather - and shall cause thee to be remembered with contempt instead of with respect.

The great error that young Falconbridge made was that he waited too long before entering so-sigh-ity, and therefore was not familiar with the prosper forms. 'Tis better to enter so-sigh-ity early, whilst thou art still young, and to learn by degrees the confidence and reliance that shall carry thee bravely through even the most brilliant assemblies.

But mark this well: in seeking to overcome bashfulness, thou must be careful to avoid the very common extreme of forwardness! For bashfulness is but a fault that may be corrected, whilst forwardness is a sin most tolerable - intolerable, I mean - and argues a sad want of breeding. To be forward, rude, and intrusive is to show thyself a benefactor - nay, a malefactor - to good manners!

And I must speak particularly to the young lay-dees who romp and banter words with provoking young men, and win the name of being "independent" - for such conduct is most un-feminine and shall injure thy character in the estimation of all well-mannered purr-sons. Be gay, be cheerful, but preserve the delicacy and refinement which are the surest virtues for conquering admiration!

As for Snobs - why, they are simply nuisances, and should be regarded as an extensive species of ape! Their whole mind is given to the tie of their cravat and their boots absorb all their philosophy. They know not what constitutes good breeding, being rude as the monkey is rude!

And Fops, who make a silly display of dry goods and jewelry - well, they place a virtue in goods which does not belong to it, elevating perishable commodities above the truer and nobler attributes of mind!

And Bores - marry, they are the worst of all! For a Bore is one who intrudes upon persons' time or company without knowing when to leave, when to cease conversation, when to offer attentions. I once knew a lay-dee who was a most unmitigated Bore of the benevolent school - she would force herself into my study at any moment, and would make me hear what I did not wish to hear, and give what I did not think it right to give! Such purr-sons are most comprehensible - I mean, most incomprehensible - in their rudeness!

The great secret to being at ease in so-sigh-ity is to forget thyself so far as to become one of the number - to lose thyself in the feeling of non-individualism, which is a sense of abandon most desartless of cultivation! Give thyself no particular anxiety about thy person or thy words - for anxiety breeds a disquiet which is fatal to enjoyment. Good-nature is every thing in so-sigh-ity, as in business - it overcomes many a mountain of difficulty!


ON THE MAKING OF VISITS

Visits hold a first place among the gentilities of life, and deserve attention most vigilant! There are many kinds of visits - visits of mere form and policy, visits of real friendship, visits of congratulation and of condolence, visits to give out invitations, visits of state to eminent purr-sons, and so forth.

Mark these rules most carefully:

First, the time for making a visit is after twelve o'clock at noon, for before that hour the lay-dee of the house is supposed to be busy at her household duties. Never make a call before that hour, or thou shalt be voted a terrible inconvenience!

Second, occupy but a brief time in thy call - fifteen or twenty minutes at most - for thou knowest not how much the lay-dee may have to do, nor where she may wish to go. If thou stayest too long, thou shalt be comprehended as a Bore!

Third, never forget to enter the room with thoroughly-cleaned boots! Always use the scraper and mats at the door, for to track mud into a lay-dee's parlor is a sin most odorous!

Fourth, if thou hast a cane, keep it in thy hand, and be careful not to make much noise with thy boots. And beware of asking the hour, or of taking out thy watch during a visit - 'tis most impolite and suggests that thou art eager to depart!

Fifth, avoid spitting on the floor - thy pocket-handkerchief will serve thy purpose! To spit on a lay-dee's carpet is a vulgarity most tolerable - intolerable - and shall mark thee as a person of no breeding whatsoever!

Sixth, to place thy hat on any article of furniture when thou enterest a room is ungenteel - to lay it on a bed is unpardonable! Thou must hold it in thy hand, or leave it in the anteroom. And if thou art invited to lay down thy hat, place it beside thee, not before thee!

Seventh, a young man will avoid sitting in an arm-chair, which should always be awarded to the lay-dees or old gentle-men present. Leave the seat next the fire to thy superiors in age or position!

Eighth, never look about thee in a room as if thou wert making an inventory! 'Tis most rude to stare at people's possessions as if thou wert counting their worth!

Ninth, the gloves should not be removed during a visit. To brush thy hat with thy hand will expose thee to the charge of extreme vulgarity!

Tenth, crossing the legs and stretching them out at full length are equally improper! Sit modestly and keep thy limbs in prosper order!

Now, as to particular kinds of visits:

Visits of congratulation upon occasion of marriage should be made as early as the parties seem ready for such visits. 'Tis now the practice for newly-married people to send out their cards, and if thou failest to respond by calling, they cannot consistently recognize thee afterward - which would be a mortification most terrible!

Visits of condolence to those who have suffered a loss by death are too much neglected in this fast country! The call should be brief, and thy words of the kindest and most considerate character, for it will greatly relieve the pangs of sorrow to feel that others are solicitous for their welfare.

After thou hast attended a party or soiree, 'tis prosper to call upon thy host within a fortnight, to make inquiries after his health and to remark upon the pleasure thou experienced. This is a pleasant way of showing that their efforts to please thee are appreciated!

On New Year's day, many houses are open for general calls, when all who are friends of the host may enter. But mark this well: 'tis not prosper for a perfect stranger to enter and introduce himself just because the door is open! Even the freedom of New Year's day will not excuse such a liberty!


ON THE FORMULA OF INTRODUCTIONS

Now attend to this matter most carefully, for introductions require great delicacy and comprehension!

The same form is always observed: "Let me introduce to you Mr. B.," or "Mr. Jones, allow me to present to you Mr. Smith." But mark this well - thou must introduce no purr-son until thou art sure it is agreeable to both parties! Lay-dees should always be asked if they wish to know Mr. So-and-so ere he is presented to them!

The rule invariably - which is to say, always and without exception - is to introduce gentle-men TO lay-dees, not lay-dees to gentle-men! Or, in case of men to men, always present the younger to the older, the lesser to the greater!

We Americans, in our disregard of rank and position, are too apt to overlook these courtesies. The custom of indiscriminate introductions is carried to such a ridiculous extent that it has been made the subject of comment by foreigners! For every one has a right to exercise his own judgment in the selection of acquaintances, and 'tis clearly a breach of po-lightness to thrust them upon thy friend without knowing whether it will be agreeable to either party!

By which I mean to say, gentle reader, that thou shouldst not go about introducing every Tom, Dick, and Harry to every Jane, Mary, and Susan without first determining whether they wish to be acquainted! For such promiscuous introductions are a vulgarity most comprehensible - I mean, most inexcusable!


ON DRESS AND ORNAMENTS

A man is judged of by his appearance, and seldom incorrectly! A neat exterior, equally free from extravagance and poverty, always proclaims a right-minded and senseless man - sensible, rather! To dress appropriately and with good taste is to respect thyself and others.

For gentle-men, mark these rules:

A black coat and trowsers are indispensable for a visit of ceremony, an entertainment, an evening party, or a ball. The white or black vest is prosper in any of these cases. Always wear gloves - kids for dancing! A gentle-man, when in dress and out of his business, should walk out gloved.

Rings and heavy gold chains are NOT in good taste! Some young purr-sons have a strong desire to sport gold and jewels, but let them remember that such is the taste of gamblers and courtesans - which is to say, of benefactors - malefactors - of the worst sort! Too much jewelry is vulgar beyond measure!

For lay-dees, the toilet is indeed a study, to which she should devote a prosper portion of her time! But all must beware the charge of vulgarity. We sometimes see dresses in which the ill-assorted or showy colors spoil the effect of the richest material. The various articles of dress must be well-chosen so as to produce an agreeable harmony!

Never put on a dark-colored bonnet with a light spring costume! Avoid uniting colors which will suggest an epigram - such as a straw-colored dress with a green bonnet! For unless thou hast an extremely fair complexion, thy malicious rivals will assert that thy face resembles a citron surrounded by its foliage!

The arrangement of the hair is an important affair most comprehensible! Avoid a cumbrous edifice of lace mixed with hair, and let thy flowers be few and choice. A spray or two of heath, the delicate blossoms of the jessamine, violets, orange blossoms, a white rose - these simple ornaments are most suitable to a young girl. For beauty unadorned is adorned the most!

In a married woman, a richer style of ornament is admissible - feathers in her bonnet, a necklace, jewels in her hair. But for a young girl, a style of modest simplicity is far more impressive and becoming!

'Tis a fact most desartless of attention that lay-dees dressed with the most studied simplicity attract the most observation, whilst those with most ornament are treated with less deference! Therefore, let simplicity be thy guide, not display!

And mark this most important maxim: the most elegant dress loses its merit if it is not worn with grace! Young girls often have an air of constraint, and their dress seems to partake of their want of ease. She is indeed fortunate who can give an easy flexibility to her figure and graceful movements to her head - she will always appear graceful and well-dressed, even in simple garments!


ON CLEANLINESS AND FASTIDIOUS-NESS

If there be one thing that I should recommend more than another, 'tis cleanliness! For without cleanliness, all thy other efforts at gentility shall be in vain!

The hands should receive special attention, as they serve for a specimen of the rest. Every morning wash them with plenty of soap and water, then with the brush clean thy nails, cut them, and beware of the dark crescent which gets the name of half-mourning - nothing can be more disgusting!

Let thy face and neck be clean - I particularly recommend attention to the ears! For a dirty ear is an abomination most odorous to all who behold it!

Rinse thy mouth often - in the morning to remove the impurities of the night, after dinner to avoid making others acquainted with the meats thou hast partaken of, and at night before retiring to rest that thou mayest sleep more sweetly!

If thou art given to the really filthy habit of using tobacco in any shape, NEVER appear in any social circle with the odor of the stuff about thee! Let thy use of it be as much in secret as possible! No gentle-man will ever smoke a cigar where its smoke can give the least offense! In Boston, smoking is positively prohibited in the streets - it should be in every city, for the smell is most tolerable - intolerable - to all purr-sons of refined sensibilities!

Frequent baths are absolutely necessary, and still more, frequent foot-baths with tepid water and soap! For the dust that one acquires in walking changes its name at the end of three days, and in making a call, thy friends will be aware of thy presence before they have seen thee - which is to say, they shall smell thee coming like a benefactor of odorous character!

Nothing is more disagreeable in either sex than soiled shoes or stockings! It shows either great negligence or uncleanliness! Let thy linen be perfectly white and thy dress spotless!

How often do we see women walking in the street with a torn or frayed dress, or a broken stocking! Idleness alone is the cause of such things! 'Tis so easy to stop a rent, and certainly it cannot be said that thread is dear!

A dress ever so simple and cheap, if it be neat, is preferable to finery and dirt - one is respectacle, the other is not!

In the pocket-handkerchief, great nicety should be observed! It should be white and always clean! A dirty handkerchief is an abomination most comprehensible! A drop of perfume on it will make it all the pleasanter to thyself and to others!

Perfect cleanliness in all things gives one a feeling of self-respect! It not only affords an agreeable sensation of comfort, but imparts an air of confidence, springing from the consciousness that thou needest not fear the investigations or ridicule of any who approach thee!

By which I mean to say, gentle reader, that if thou art clean in thy person and thy garments, thou shalt walk with thy head held high, whilst if thou art dirty and slovenly, thou shalt slink about like a vagrom fellow most ashamed of himself!


ON CONVERSATION AND PERSONAL ADDRESS

'Tis rare to meet with purr-sons who can converse agreeably! And yet how many kinds of talkers there are in the world! First comes the man who details his own adventures, bringing in even his boyish escapades - he is a Bore most tolerable! Then there is the gastronomic talker who regales thee with descriptions of famous dishes - most tedious! The detailer of empty trifles, the universal grumbler who sees nothing of the sun but its spots, the self-constituted reporter of every kind of scandal - all these are enemies to good conversation!

If thou wishest to make thyself agreeable to a lay-dee, turn the conversation adroitly upon taste, or art, or books, or purr-sons, or events of the day. Make her smile - suffer her to be superior in any encounter of wit - and she will pronounce thee "the most charming of men!" Thou wilt have shown thyself clever and well-bred!

Never seem studied in thy phrases, nor talk above the comprehension or contrary to the taste of the purr-son addressed, otherwise thou mayest be voted either a pedant or a Bore!

The woman who wishes her conversation to be agreeable will avoid conceit or affectation, and laughter which is not natural and spontaneous. Her language will be easy and unstudied, marked by a graceful carelessness which never oversteps the limits of propriety! Her lips will readily yield to a pleasant smile - she will not love to hear herself talk - her tones will bear the impress of sincerity, and her eyes kindle with animation as she speaks!

We need scarcely advert to the rudeness of interrupting any one who is speaking! 'Tis a vulgarity most odorous - odious - and shows a want of breeding most terrible!

Some men have a mania for Greek and Latin quotations - this is a peculiarity to be avoided! Nothing is more wearisome than pedantry! For a man who speaks in dead languages is himself a dead bore to all who hear him!

If thou feelest thy intellectual superiority to any one with whom thou art conversing, do not seek to bear him down - it would be an inglorious triumph and a breach of good manners! Beware, too, of speaking lightly of subjects which bear a sacred character! No purr-son will think the more of thee for irreligious expression!

Do NOT TRY to be witty! True wit comes spontaneously, and is not forced! Witlings occasionally gain a reputation in so-sigh-ity, but nothing is more insipid and in worse taste than their conceited harangues and self-sufficient air!

The art of pleasing is, in truth, the very soul of good-breeding! For the precise object of ettycate is to render us agreeable to all with whom we associate - to make us, at the same time, esteemed and loved!

And above all, avoid the use of slang terms and phrases! They are, to the last degree, vulgar and objectionable! Indeed, one of the charms of conversation consists in the correct use of language! If any one thing marks a purr-son's bringing up, 'tis the language used in company! Any one who uses slang words, who talks loudly and rudely, who utters an oath, or who becomes angered and expresses it, is NO gentle-man and has not had good associations!

For a lay-dee to be guilty of even one of these sins is too palpably inexcusable to need remark! A lay-dee who swears or uses slang is a benefactor - malefactor - to her entire sex, and brings shame upon all women!


ON THE WRITING OF LETTERS

The writing of letters requires attention to many particulars, and I shall instruct thee in them with all the comprehension at my command!

A letter addressed to a purr-son of eminence should have a seal on the envelope. For other letters, the ordinary envelope is sufficient. Letter paper with designs of any kind is in questionable taste - perfectly plain paper should be preferred!

In writing to a superior, employ paper of full letter size. Write the name, and in the line underneath the words "Dear Sir." Leave a line between this word and the first line of thy letter. Always write to the point - using not a superfluous or meaningless word, and be as brief as possible!

Abbreviations are admissible in notes entered in a book of reference, but not elsewhere, except in commercial correspondence! For to abbreviate in a letter to a friend is to show a lack of respect most odorous!

Letters of invitation should always be franked - which is to say, the postage should be paid - and if the distance be not too great, they should be sent by hand!

A letter given to a third purr-son, if it be a letter of introduction, should NOT be sealed! For to seal such a letter suggests that thou hast writ something unfavorable about the bearer, and dost not wish him to read it!

A young man writing to one advanced in years should not conclude his letter with the common phrase "Receive, sir, the assurance of my regard." It should be "Accept, sir, this expression of the regards of your very humble servant!" For a young man must show proper deference to his elders!

To a lay-dee, write "Accept, madam, the assurance of my respect," or "I am, my dear lady, yours very sincerely!"

'Tis ill-bred to write on a half-sheet - the shortest letter requires a whole one! And all letters must be pre-paid! Never impose postage upon a friend - 'tis a contemptible act to make a purr-son, after the trouble of writing to thee on thy business, pay his own postage!

Letters of business should be expressed in brief and precise terms, with details arranged in exact order. Letters of congratulation should be distinguished for choice language, to the exclusion of all expressions parasitical or common-place!

And in every case and circumstance, be truthful and earnest! For deceitful and false expressions are abominations most tolerable - intolerable - and shall mark thee as a malefactor of the worst sort!


ON BALLS, EVENING-PARTIES, AND RECEPTIONS

Now attend most vigilantly to this chapter, for it concerns the deportment at dances and soirees, where many young purr-sons make terrible errors through ignorance of the prosper forms!

To deport oneself satisfactorily at the dance, 'tis necessary to understand much about the dances which may be introduced. 'Tis a charming accomplishment to be a good dancer, and I shall advise all, male and female, to learn the Terpsichorean art ere the days of youth are past! By which I mean the art of dancing, not the art of Terpsichore, who was a goddess of the ancients - though what she has to do with dancing I cannot comprehend!

An invitation to a dance should be given at least a week beforehand, for a lay-dee sometimes requires time to prepare her toilet! When thou arrivest, the host receives thee, and after the usual compliments, which should be very brief, do not fail in polite recognitions to any lay-dee in the company with whom thou art acquainted!

Mark this well: ball-room introductions are NOT regarded as introductions for a more extended acquaintance than for the evening! Should the parties afterward meet upon the street or elsewhere, let the gentle-man be careful not to presume upon any recognition of the lay-dee until SHE has FIRST bowed! If she fails to extend this recognition, let the gentle-man take no umbrage, for he has no real claim upon her acquaintance merely from a public ball-room introduction!

An introduction at a private soiree is another thing - there the relations of the parties introduced are permanent, and they are properly acquainted thereafter!

If a gentle-man escorts a lay-dee to the dance, he is her cavalier for the evening! He must see that she is always provided with agreeable partners, that she always has a seat when required, has the necessary refreshments, and so forth! He must dance with her first of all, and as often during the evening as is prosper, considering the claims of others and the wishes of the lay-dee!

Avoid seeking the same partner too often in the dance - thou wilt excite remark and expose thyself to the charge of partiality or perhaps of coquetry! 'Tis a graceful attention in a young man to select as partners those lay-dees whose want of personal attractions condemn them to the terrible punishment of being the "wall-flowers" of the evening! Such attentions will procure thee a feeling of grateful regard!

If a married lay-dee is present and dancing whilst her husband is in the room, a purr-son desiring her for a partner should first be sure that 'tis agreeable to the husband! For to dance with a man's wife without his consent is to comprehend him most terribly - which is to say, to offend him most grievously!

If a crowd is present and a gentle-man has occasion to make his way through a press of crinoline and drapery, he should proceed most carefully - haste would be very rude and inexcusable! The danger of soiling or tearing or disarranging a lay-dee's costume forbids any gentle-man making a careless step!

If 'tis necessary to step in front of a lay-dee in passing, always apologize for the step! Otherwise she may very properly think thou dost not know what belongs to good manners! A lay-dee is always pleased with an apology if 'tis gracefully and kindly made!

During a dance, whilst awaiting the music or whilst unengaged, a lay-dee and gentle-man should avoid long conversations, as they are apt to interfere with the progress of the dance! On the other hand, a gentle-man should not stand like an automaton, as though he were afraid of his partner, but should endeavor to render himself agreeable by those airy nothings which amuse for the moment and are in harmony with the occasion!

But mark this most carefully: thou shouldst invariably avoid the use of slang terms and phrases! They are, to the last degree, vulgar and objectionable! I once heard a young lay-dee express the opinion that a bonnet was "awful," and a young gentle-man assert of his coat that it was "played out!" Such language is a mortification - I mean an abomination - and marks the speaker as a purr-son of no breeding!

There is a custom which is sometimes practiced both in the assembly-room and at private parties which cannot be too strongly reprehended - I allude to the habit of ridicule and ungenerous criticism of those who are ungraceful or otherwise obnoxious to censure! Of its gross impropriety and vulgarity I need hardly express an opinion! 'Tis an utter disregard for the feelings of others most tolerable - intolerable - and shows a want of breeding most terrible!

The Koran says, "Do not mock - the mocked may be better than the mocker!" Those thou condemnest may not have had the same advantages as thyself in acquiring grace or dignity, whilst they may be infinitely superior in purity of heart and mental accomplishments! Imagine thyself the victim of others' ridicule, and thou wilt cease to indulge in a pastime which only gains for thee the hatred of those thou satirizest!

Lay-dees will always be careful of their associates at the public ball, for there are occasionally to be found purr-sons whose acquaintance 'tis not prosper to make! The young female is ever the cynosure of all eyes - which is to say, the center of attention - and cannot comport herself too strictly nor choose her partners too carefully!

In walking up or down the room, the lay-dee should always be accompanied by a gentle-man - 'tis quite improper to saunter around alone!

When a young lay-dee declines dancing with a gentle-man, 'tis her duty to give him a reason why, no matter how frivolous it may be! 'Tis simply an act of courtesy to offer him an excuse! On the other hand, no gentle-man ought to compromise his self-respect by taking the slightest offense at seeing a lay-dee by whom he has just been refused dance immediately after with some one else! A lay-dee has a hundred motives for conduct which she cannot explain, and for a gentle-man to take offense at her simple declination to dance is very silly and unmanly!

During the act of dancing, all parties should have on their summer looks - which is to say, their smiling faces! Dancing is rightly supposed to be an enjoyment, but the somber countenances of some who engage in it might almost lead to the belief that it were a solemn duty being performed! If those who laugh in church would transfer their merriment to the assembly-room, and those who are sad in the assembly-room would carry their gravity to the church, they both might discover the appositeness - the appropriateness - of Solomon's declaration that there is a time to be merry and a time to be sad!

'Tis the duty of gentle-men to avoid showing marked preference to particular lay-dees by devoting their undivided attentions to them or dancing exclusively with them! Too often the belle of the evening, with no other charms than beauty of form and feature, monopolizes the regards of a circle of admirers, whilst modest merit of less personal attraction is both overlooked and neglected! The real man of sense will not fail to recognize most solicitously any lay-dee who may seem neglected or unattended!

On the other hand, no lay-dee, however numerous the solicitations of her admirers, should consent to dance repeatedly when by so doing she excludes other lay-dees from participating in the same amusement! Still less should she dance exclusively with the same gentle-man to the disadvantage of others!

As to dress for the dance: let simplicity be the guide, and not display! The lay-dee tricked out in many jewels and ribbons looks too much like a moving advertisement to command respect for it! If lay-dees generally knew how deep an impression a pure style of dress makes upon the other sex, and realized how trifling a gaudy dress seems to the purr-son of true taste, I surmise their vanity alone would impel them to simpler attire!

For gentle-men: white gloves, white vest, light-colored cravat, dress-coat, black pants, and patent-leather gaiters or light calf-skin boots well polished constitute the prosper ball-room costume! The frock-coat would not be tolerated a moment in any fashionable so-sigh-ity in Europe, and in my own opinion 'tis a violation of good taste, being unsuited either to a ball-room or private assembly!

When a lay-dee has accepted refreshment, her attending gentle-man should hasten to relieve her of her glass or plate, and as her cavalier should see that all her wants and wishes have been complied with! The refreshments over, the gentle-man should offer his arm and gallant the lay-dee to her seat in the ball-room - or if she wishes to retire to the dress-room, he should gallant her to the door and there await her coming out to convey her to the dancing-floor again!

The lay-dees' dressing-room, 'tis unnecessary to say, is a sacred precinct into which no man should ever presume to look! To go into it would be an outrage which none could overlook or forgive! 'Tis a sanctuary most inviolable - which is to say, most sacred and not to be violated!

When the hour comes for retiring home, be sure to be ready for the lay-dee whom thou hast accompanied to the dance! Thy obligations are not discharged until she is again, under thine own eyes, seen safely at her own door! If thou hast come to the room unattended, select during the latter part of the evening some lay-dee who will be glad of thy company home, offer her thy services, and if she signifies assent, be careful to be ready at her call!

In leaving an evening-party, 'tis unnecessary to seek the master of the house - thy farewell will be dispensed with, and thou shouldst leave without disturbing any one to occasion remark!


ON CARDS, CHESS, AND OTHER GAMES

'Tis well at a ball to have a table for cards and men for chess, for all the guests are not dancers, and 'tis the duty of a host to see that ALL enjoy themselves! 'Tis customary for partners to bow slightly to each other before beginning a game of cards or chess!

To discuss the rules of play is ungenteel! In a quiet party, the tact and cordiality of the entertainers should put all the guests at their ease!

'Tis improper to express thy opinion loudly in company, or to remain long at the card-table when thou art young and known to be a good dancer! For to neglect the lay-dees in the adjoining room whilst thou playest at cards is to show thyself a Bore most tolerable!

Some purr-sons in playing cards show an effort to conceal their hand - this is ill-bred! If it be a pleasure to spectators to watch the game, why shouldst thou object to it?

Thou wilt sometimes see one partner reproach another sharply for unskillful play, thus convicting himself of being more unskilled in the science of good-breeding! For to upbraid thy partner is to show thyself a benefactor - malefactor - to good manners!

The man who utters noisy complaints about his luck, or manifests unseemly joy at winning a game, raising his voice to a high key on all occasions, is so ignorant as to be unworthy of admission into a drawing-room! He is a Bore most odorous!

In playing chess, avoid being too silent and abstracted, for such conduct is only fit for the study! Use a cheerful air and make others feel thy geniality, if thou wouldst win hearts as well as games!


ON ENTERTAINMENTS AND DINNER-PARTIES

To give an invitation is to take the responsibility of thy guest's happiness during the time he is under thy roof! Or rather - to invite a man is to undertake to do all in thy power to make him feel satisfied with the pleasure thou offerest him!

In order to do this, 'tis essential to know the tastes of thy guests! To invite two purr-sons at enmity with each other to an entertainment is a blunder most comprehensible - I mean inexcusable! 'Tis unpardonable to bring such together in a small party, unless the way to reconciliation lies open!

An invitation to dinner should be given at least two days beforehand, except in extraordinary cases! From an inferior to a superior, it should be made in purr-son!

In ceremonious dinners, the place of each guest is assigned beforehand, thus avoiding putting several lay-dees together! Each one should have a gentle-man next her!

The host offers his arm to the lay-dee deserving of most consideration! Young people should yield to those more advanced in years!

Before passing into the dining-room, each gentle-man offers his LEFT arm to a lay-dee and conducts her to table! Mark this well - the left arm, not the right!

Beware of arriving too early or too late! In either case there is an awkwardness - in the former thou inconveniencest thy host, in the latter his guests!

Once at table, thou shouldst not lose sight of the plate or glass of thy fair neighbor, showing thyself attentive without affectation or over-officiousness!

Now mark these rules of table manners most carefully, for they are of great importation:

First, meat should be cut only according as it is carried to the mouth! To cut up a plateful is the very height of greediness and ill-breeding!

Second, bread is broken as it is wanted! After soup, which is served out by the host, the spoon remains on the plate, as it will not be used again!

Third, where wine is used, three glasses are usually laid down to each guest - one for ordinary wines, another of smaller size for claret, the third to receive the sparkling foam of the champagne! In drinking, thou shouldst say to thy neighbor "Sir, may I offer you?" and not employ the ungenteel phrase "Will you take?" as if thou wert at the bar of some ordinary drinking-saloon!

Fourth, if the dish that thou desirest be too far from thy neighbor, do not ask another guest - the servant will attend thy orders!

Fifth, the noise of the knife and plate should be heard as little as possible! Rapidity in eating is also ill-bred! For to eat like a ravenous beast is to show thyself a benefactor - malefactor - to good manners!

Sixth, a knowledge of carving is indispensable to all men who would act the host with grace and propriety!

Seventh, do not assist thyself to any dish where servants stand ready to supply thee!

Eighth, some purr-sons use their bread at dinner to dry up their plates - this is tolerable beyond the family circle - which is to say, intolerable - and even there is rather childish!

Ninth, never take any thing out of thy pocket to lay on the table! For what business has thy pocket-watch or thy handkerchief upon the dining table?

Tenth, the napkin should rest on the knees, only half unfolded! The fork is never to be laid on its back!

Eleventh, the knife and fork and table utensils generally should never be handed endways, but should be held by the middle!

Twelfth, coffee is generally served after passing into the drawing room! The lay-dee of the house fills it out if it be after dinner - after breakfast this office may be left to a servant!

Parents should be careful to save their children from awkwardness in company, either in treading on a lay-dee's dress, or using the knife in eating, or worse still, their fingers! For children who eat with their fingers are little better than animals, and shall grow up to be benefactors - malefactors - to so-sigh-ity!


ON THE ETTYCATE OF THE STREET

Now attend to this matter, for a true gentle-man is known by his demeanor in the street as much as in the parlor!

In walking with a lay-dee in the street, leave her the inner side of the pavement - which is to say, the side away from the carriages and horses! For 'tis thy duty to protect her from being splashed or jostled!

If thou meetest friends in a narrow passage or on a footpath, be careful not to block up the way! It would be very impolite to inconvenience the passers-by in this manner!

In whatever so-sigh-ity thou art, 'tis unpardonable to remain covered in the presence of a lay-dee! I recall the story of Louis the Fourteenth, who uncovered before a vender of cakes, being asked why, said "Is not the king's mother a woman?" And Henry Clay, when a negro woman courtesied to him, raised his hat politely to her in return, and when asked "Do you recognize negroes?" made the noble reply: "I never allow negroes to excel me in good manners!"

By which I mean to say that a gentle-man should show respect to all women, regardless of their station in life!

To follow a lay-dee in the street and turn the head to stare at her is impertinent beyond measure! 'Tis a vulgarity most odorous and marks the offender as a cad and a Snob!

When thy visitor retires, thou shouldst accompany him to the anteroom and save him the trouble of opening the door! In the case of a lay-dee or an old gentle-man, 'tis prosper to go to the foot of the staircase!


ON THE POLITENESS OF BUSINESS

Prosper politeness is essential in employees and employers! The true gentle-man will show courtesy in all his business dealings, for rudeness in business is as intolerable as rudeness in the parlor!

Employers should treat their employees with respect and consideration! Employees should show deference to their employers! But both should remember that politeness is not a luxury to be reserved for the drawing-room - 'tis a necessity for all occasions and all stations in life!


SPECIAL ADVICE TO YOUNG MEN

Now attend well, young men, for I shall give thee advice of great importation!

There is a great, invariable law of compensations in this world - which is to say, that every man receives according to his desarts! If thou art honest, industrious, and polite, thou shalt prosper! If thou art dishonest, lazy, and rude, thou shalt fail!

The true principles of conduct are these: be honest in all thy dealings, be diligent in thy work, be courteous to all purr-sons, be respectful to thy superiors, be kind to thy inferiors, be modest in thy bearing, be temperate in thy habits, and be faithful to thy word!

The grand secret of success is to make thyself agreeable to all with whom thou hast commerce! For a man who is well-mannered shall find doors opened to him which remain closed to the boor and the Snob!

Cultivate thy mind, refine thy manners, purify thy speech, and govern thy temper! For these are the marks of a true gentle-man, and shall win thee respect and advancement in all thy undertakings!


SPECIAL WORD FOR LAY-DEES ONLY

Now, gentle lay-dees, attend to this advice which I give thee for thy particular benefit!

The necessities of particular styles of dress require careful consideration! Velvets suit some complexions, muslins others! A fair face should be always in smiles, for a smiling countenance is more beautiful than any jewel!

Be careful of thy person, but not vain! Be modest in thy dress, but not slovenly! Be cheerful in thy conversation, but not forward! Be graceful in thy movements, but not affected!

Remember that true beauty comes from within - from a pure heart and a cultivated mind! External ornaments may attract the eye, but 'tis the beauty of the soul that wins lasting admiration and love!

Avoid coquetry and flirting, for they are marks of baseness and shall bring thee into disrepute! Be sincere in thy affections, honest in thy words, and modest in thy bearing!

And above all, remember that a lay-dee is known by her manners, her speech, and her conduct! Therefore, conduct thyself always as if thou wert in the presence of the most respectacle purr-sons in so-sigh-ity, and thou shalt never give cause for reproach!


ON THE LAWS OF HOME ETTYCATE

This is a chapter for every one to read and to commit to memory! For home ettycate is as important as the ettycate of the parlor or the ball-room!

How are homes made models of happiness and comfort? By the observance of courtesy and kindness among all members of the family! A man should be as polite to his wife and children as he is to strangers! A woman should be as gracious to her husband and family as she is to guests!

The laws of intercourse with guests are these: make them feel welcome, attend to their comfort, engage them in pleasant conversation, and see that all their wants are supplied!

The laws of intercourse with members of the family are these: speak kindly, act considerately, forgive readily, love constantly!

For a home where courtesy reigns is a paradise on earth, whilst a home where rudeness prevails is a hell most tolerable - intolerable!


ON RESPECT FOR RELIGION AND OLD AGE

Now this is advice designed for the young of both sexes, which they will not fail to profit by if they are senseless purr-sons - sensible, rather!

Show respect for religion in all thy words and deeds! Never speak lightly of sacred matters, nor mock those who are devout! For religion is the foundation of morality, and morality is the foundation of ettycate!

Show respect for old age in all thy conduct! Rise when an elderly purr-son enters the room! Give them the seat of honor! Listen to their counsel! Speak to them with deference! For they have lived long and seen much, and deserve the respect of all who are younger!

To mock old age is to show thyself a benefactor - malefactor - of the worst sort! For thou too shalt be old one day, if thou livest, and shalt desire the respect of the young!


CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S CONCLUSION

Thus endeth my most excellent treatise on ettycate, which I have set down with great care and learning for the instruction of all who would become gentle-men and lay-dees of true desart!

If there be any who think that I have misspoken any word or misremembered any rule, let them know that such errors are tolerable - intolerable - and are not mine but theirs! For I am as comprehending of ettycate as any man living, and have observed the prosper forms of so-sigh-ity with vigilant attention all my days!

These lessons contain great wisdom and practical instruction, teaching us to be clean in our purr-sons, modest in our dress, courteous in our speech, graceful in our movements, considerate in our behavior, respectful to our superiors, kind to our inferiors, hospitable to our guests, and loving to our families!

They warn us against being Snobs, Fops, or Bores! They instruct us in the prosper forms of visiting, introducing, conversing, writing letters, dancing, dining, walking in the street, conducting business, and all other matters pertaining to so-sigh-able intercourse!

Let all purr-sons study these rules and learn from them, for they are not complicated or burdensome, but grounded upon simplicity itself - the great law which underlies all, which is the blessed Golden Rule: Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you!

Or as I would put it in my own words: Treat all purr-sons with the courtesy and respect which thou wouldst wish them to show unto thee, and thou shalt be comprehended - which is to say, understood and appreciated - as a true gentle-man or lay-dee!

I, Dogberry, have done my duty in setting down these rules for thee! May they serve to make thee a better and more senseless purr-son - by which I mean sensible, naturally! For there is nothing I desire more than that all men and women should be as polite, as gracious, and as well-mannered as myself, which would make the world a much better place and greatly reduce the need for constables to deal with vagrom fellows and malefactors!

If thou hast profited from this treatise, remember that it is written down by me with great vigilance and dedication! And if thou hast not profited from it, well, thou art probably a purr-son of aspicious character who understands nothing of ettycate or morality, and thy opinion matters not a whit!

Let each purr-son take from these lessons what wisdom they may, and let them apply it to their own lives, that they may avoid being comprehended in rudeness or vulgarity, and that they may live a life desartless of praise and remembrance - which is to say, deserving of praise and worthy of remembrance!

For to be well-mannered is to be respected! To be courteous is to be loved! To observe the prosper forms of ettycate is to make oneself welcome in all so-sigh-ity! And to be a true gentle-man or lay-dee is to possess the key which unlocks all hearts!

Thus concludes Constable Dogberry's Most Excellent Treatise on Ettycate! May it serve thee well in all thy social endeavors!


THE END OF IT ALL

Written down this day by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch, Man of Letters, Expert in Matters of Ettycate and Po-lightness, and Upholder of All Prosper Forms of So-sigh-able Conduct, with all due solemnity and careful attention to every particular!
CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S REMEMBRANCES OF
THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES

Being a Most Excellent and Faithful Recounting of Those Remarkable Tales,
As Told by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch,
With All Due Accuracy and Preservation of Detail


TO THE READER:

Good morrow to thee, gentle reader! I, Dogberry, being a man of considerable reputation and great negligence - which is to say, diligence - have undertaken to relate these most remarkable tales concerning one Sherlock Holmes, a defective - nay, a detective - of London Town. Though some vagrom fellows might question whether I have preserved these tales correctly in my memory, I assure thee that I am as honest as any man living, and these accounts are as accurate as any that have been writ down by that Doctor Watson, who was Holmes's companion, though naturally not so eloquent as myself.

These tales concern mysteries most aspicious and crimes most odorous, all of which were comprehended - which is to say, solved - by this Holmes fellow through his boiling-ant powers of seduction. I mean deduction, naturally! For Holmes had the gift of deducing truth from glues - from clues - in a manner most remarkable and worthy of study.

I present these tales for thy edification and entertainment, and if thou findest any errors therein, know that they are not mine but the fault of those who first told them to me incorrectly.


I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA
As I Recall It Most Unclearly

Now attend well, for I shall recount to thee the tale of that most aspicious matter concerning the King of Bohemia and a woman most remarkable, which affair I have preserved most carefully in my memory, being a man of great negligence and wisdom.

There lived in Baker Street a defective fellow by the name of Sherlock Holmes - though why they called him defective when he was so boiling-ant, I cannot comprehend. This Holmes had a companion, one Doctor Watson, a good physician who did write down all these advent-chores - adventures, rather - though not nearly so well as I could have done myself, being a man of greater desart.

One evening, as I have been told - for I was not present myself, being occupied with matters of the watch - there came to Holmes's chambers a gentle-man of remarkulous size and bearing, who wore a mask upon his face. This visitor, being aspicious of his own identity being dis-covered, spoke in a voice most deep and terriblouse.

"I am the Count von Kramm," quoth he, though this was a lie most odorous, for he was truly the King of Bohemia himself! But Holmes, being a fellow of boiling-ant seduction - which is to say, the power to seduce the truth from glues - did preserve immediately that this was no mere count but a purr-son of royal blood.

"Your Majesty," said Holmes with great confidence, "pray tell me thy difficulty."

The King, being comprehended in his deception, removed his mask and confessed all. It seemed that in his youth, being but a prince, he had engaged in a romantic liaison most tolerable - most intolerable to his present circumstances, that is! - with a woman named Irene Adler, who had been a singer of great renown. This Adler woman possessed a photograph - a picture made by those new mechanical devices - showing herself and the King together in attitudes most compromising.

Now the King was to be married to a princess of great virtue and strictness, and if this photograph were to be revealed, his marriage would be ruined most completely! He had tried to steal the photograph back through various means - burglars and waylayings and such malefactions - but all had failed most miserably.

"I shall retrieve this photograph," declared Holmes with confidence most desartless. "Fear not, Your Majesty!"

Holmes then disguised himself - for he was a master of such deceptions, being able to make himself appear as different purr-sons through costumes and such artifices. He dressed himself as a groom, or perhaps a stable-hand, and went to observe this Irene Adler's house in a street called Serpentine Avenue - though what serpents had to do with it, I cannot say, unless there were snakes dwelling there, which seems unlikely in London.

Through clever observation and the creation of a false alarm - for Holmes arranged to have smoke thrown into the lady's house, causing her to rush to the place where she kept her most valuable possessions - Holmes dis-covered where the photograph was hidden! It was kept behind a sliding panel in the lady's sitting room, a most aspicious hiding place!

But mark well what happened next! For Irene Adler was no ordinary woman, but one of boiling-ant intelligence herself! She had comprehended Holmes's deception - which is to say, she had seen through his disguise - and had observed him most carefully. That very night, she fled London with her true love, a lawyer fellow named Godfrey Norton, leaving behind only a letter for Holmes and a photograph - but not the photograph the King wanted! Nay, 'twas a photograph of herself alone, and a letter explaining that she would keep the compromising photograph as protection against the King, but would not use it to harm him unless he moved against her.

Holmes, reading this letter, was filled with admiration most profound! "She has beaten me," said he to Watson, speaking of Irene Adler. "She would have made an excellent criminous - criminal - though in truth she committed no crime, being only guilty of loving unwisely and protecting herself sensibly."

The King offered Holmes a ring of great value as payment, but Holmes requested instead the photograph of Irene Adler that she had left behind. "To Sherlock Holmes," said the defective, "she is always THE woman. For she comprehended me when I thought to comprehend her, and proved herself my equal in wit and wisdom."

MORAL: Even the cleverest man may be out-witted by a woman of intelligence and courage! 'Tis better to be senseless - sensible - and honest than to rely on deception alone. And a woman who can think for herself is desartless of great respect, even from those she has defeated!


II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
As I Do Imperfectly Recall It

Attend now to this tale of a most curious conspiracy, which I shall relate with perfect accuracy, having heard it told many times and remembered it with my usual negligence!

There came to Holmes's chambers one day a man of remarkable appearance, being possessed of the brightest red hair that ever was seen upon a mortal head. His name was Jabez Wilson - though what his parents were thinking giving him such a name as Jabez, I cannot comprehend - and he was a pawnbroker by trade, which is to say he lent money upon pledges and kept a shop full of items that had been pawned.

This Wilson fellow brought with him a most remarkable story. It seemed that some weeks before, his assistant - a young man who worked for half-wages, being content with little pay in exchange for learning the pawnbroking business - had shown him an advertisement in the newspaper. This advertisement announced the existence of something called "The Red-Headed League," an organization most aspicious!

According to the advertisement, the League had been founded by a wealthy American who had died and left his fortune to provide positions for men with red hair! The work was simple: to copy out the Encyclopedia Britannica - a great book of knowledge - for four hours each day, at a wage of four pounds per week, which was a sum most desartless of consideration!

Wilson, being possessed of qualifying hair most red and brilliant, applied for this position and was accepted immediately. For eight weeks, he attended at an office in Fleet Street and copied out articles from the Encyclopedia, beginning with entries under the letter A. He received his wages faithfully each week, four golden sovereigns placed in his hand most regularly!

But then, on this very morning, when Wilson arrived at the office, he found upon the door a card reading: "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED." The office was empty, the League was gone, and Wilson was comprehended most completely as to what had happened!

"Pray tell me," said Holmes, "about this assistant of yours. What manner of man is he?"

Wilson described his assistant as being small and stout, with a white splash of acid upon his forehead from some chemical accident, and most remarkably enthusiastic about photography, spending much time in the cellar developing his photographs.

At this intelligence, Holmes's eyes did light up most aspiciously! "I begin to comprehend this matter!" said he. "Come, Watson, we must visit Mr. Wilson's pawnshop at once!"

When they arrived at the shop, Holmes did a most curious thing - he struck the pavement before the shop with his walking stick, listening to the sound it made. Then he visited the shops nearby, observing all most carefully.

"Watson," said he afterward, "we have encountered one of the boldest crimes I have yet seen! For that assistant of Mr. Wilson's is none other than John Clay, a famous criminous - criminal - of remarkable intelligence but malicious character! The Red-Headed League was but a ruse, a deception most odorous, designed to remove Mr. Wilson from his shop for several hours each day!"

"But why?" asked Watson, being comprehended by confusion.

"Because, my dear Watson, Mr. Wilson's pawnshop is situated next to a bank! And whilst Mr. Wilson was copying the Encyclopedia, John Clay and his accomplice were digging a tunnel from the cellar of the pawnshop into the vault of the bank, intending to steal the gold stored there!"

That very night, Holmes arranged an ambush most senseless - most sensible! He and Watson, along with police constables - fellows like myself, though naturally not of my stature and reputation - hid themselves in the bank vault and waited.

Sure enough, in the dead of night, up through the floor came John Clay and his companion! They had completed their tunnel and were about to commit their robbery when Holmes and the constables seized them most firmly!

John Clay, being comprehended in his villainy, surrendered with great dignity. "You have beaten me this time, Mr. Holmes," said he, showing no shame at all, which proves that criminals are aspicious of all decent feeling!

Mr. Wilson was amazed to learn that his shop had been used for such nefarious purposes, and grateful that the crime had been prevented. Holmes explained all most patiently, demonstrating how every detail of the Red-Headed League had been designed to facilitate the robbery.

MORAL: When something seems too good to be true, 'tis likely a deception most odorous! A man should be aspicious - suspicious, rather - of opportunities that seem to offer great reward for little labor. And criminals, no matter how clever, shall eventually be comprehended by those who are more clever still, such as Holmes, or myself when I am investigating vagrom fellows in my own jurisdiction!


III. A CASE OF IDENTITY
As I Recall It With Perfect Imperfection

Now attend to this tale of romance and deception most tolerable - most intolerable! - which I shall relate with all due accuracy, though the details may have become somewhat confused in my excellent memory.

There came to Holmes a young woman of modest means and gentle disposition, by name of Mary Sutherland. She was dressed in clothing somewhat old-fashioned and carried herself with an air of innocence most remarkable. This Mary sought Holmes's assistance in finding her fiancé, who had vanished most mysteriously!

The tale she told was this: Mary lived with her mother and step-father, one Mr. Windibank, who was a wine merchant. Mary had a small income from investments left by her deceased father - or uncle, I cannot recall which, though 'tis not material to the tale - which gave her a hundred pounds per year, a sum most desartless for a young woman.

Now Mary had met a gentleman at a ball - or perhaps it was a church gathering, my memory being sometimes unclear on such particulars - named Hosmer Angel. This Mr. Angel was a most peculiar suitor! He would only meet Mary when her step-father was away on business trips. He wrote to her in typewriting, claiming his eyes were weak and he could not write by hand. He made her promise never to speak of him to her step-father. And he insisted that she swear always to be faithful to him, no matter what might happen!

All these demands, which should have made Mary aspicious - suspicious! - she accepted with the innocence of a trusting heart. They became engaged to be married, and the wedding was arranged. But on the very morning of the ceremony, when they rode together in a cab to the church, Hosmer Angel suddenly cried out to the driver, leaped from the cab, and disappeared into the traffic most completely! Since that moment, Mary had neither seen nor heard from him.

Holmes listened to all this with great attention, asking many questions about Mr. Angel's appearance and habits. Then he examined the letters that Angel had sent to Mary, all typed upon a machine most mechanically.

"Tell me," said Holmes, "about your step-father, Mr. Windibank. What manner of man is he?"

Mary described Windibank as being younger than her mother, rather quiet, and not much interested in socializing. She mentioned that he too used a typewriting machine for his business correspondence.

At this, Holmes's face showed that he had comprehended the entire mystery! But he said nothing to Mary, only telling her to put the matter from her mind and forget about Hosmer Angel.

After Mary had departed, Watson asked Holmes what he had dis-covered. And Holmes revealed a deception most odorous and contemptible!

"Watson," said he, "there is no Hosmer Angel. The man was Mr. Windibank himself, disguised!"

Holmes explained the entire malefaction: Windibank had married Mary's mother for her money and Mary's inheritance. But when Mary came of age, she would receive her income, and might marry and leave home, taking her money with her. To prevent this, Windibank had disguised himself as Hosmer Angel, courted his step-daughter under this false identity, and made her promise eternal faithfulness to him. Then, by disappearing, he ensured that Mary would remain unmarried, waiting faithfully for Angel's return, and thus her money would remain in the household!

"'Tis a crime most odorous!" declared Holmes. "But there is no law against a man disguising himself and courting his own step-daughter, though 'tis morally reprehensible most completely!"

Holmes confronted Windibank with his deductions, and the villain could not deny them, though he showed no shame for his actions. Holmes threatened to beat him with his hunting crop - a threat most desartless, in my opinion! - and sent him away with a warning.

MORAL: Not all crimes can be punished by law, though they are crimes most terrible against decency and trust! A woman should be aspicious of suitors who make mysterious demands and behave in ways most peculiar. And a man who would deceive an innocent person for the sake of money is a benefactor - a malefactor! - of the worst sort, desartless of nothing but contempt!


IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
As I Remember It With Great Imperfection

Attend well to this tale of murder and secrets most ancient, which took place in a valley called Boscombe, though whether there were any boscoms there I cannot say!

A wealthy man named Charles McCarthy was found dead in the woods near a pool called Boscombe Pool, having been struck upon the head most violently with some blunt instrument. His son, young James McCarthy, was immediately accused of the murder, for he had been seen following his father into the woods, and he had been found beside the body with blood upon his hands!

The evidence against young James was most odorous - which is to say, most damning! Several witnesses had heard father and son arguing most violently in recent days. James could give no good account of why he had followed his father into the woods. And he told a story most incomprehensible about seeing his father talking with someone before he died, but could not describe this mysterious person clearly!

But James's childhood friend, a Miss Alice Turner - daughter of another wealthy landowner in the district - believed firmly in his innocence. She wrote to Holmes begging him to investigate, for she was convinced that James was not a murderer.

Holmes traveled to Boscombe Valley with Watson and examined all the evidence most carefully. He walked to the scene of the crime and observed the ground with great attention, finding glues - clues! - that the police had missed entirely, being less boiling-ant in their observations than Holmes.

Through his investigations, Holmes dis-covered several remarkable facts! First, that Charles McCarthy's last words - heard by his son as he lay dying - were "a rat," which seemed senseless but proved most significant! Second, that the murderer was a tall man who walked with a limp and smoked Indian cigars. Third, that Charles McCarthy had been calling out to someone named "Ballarat," which James had heard as "a rat"!

Holmes also learned the secret history of Charles McCarthy, who had not always been a respectable landowner! Nay, he had once been in Australia, where he had been involved in criminal activities most tolerable - intolerable - and had known a man there who had cause to hate him!

Holmes deduced that the murderer was one John Turner, the very man whose daughter Alice wished to marry James! This Turner fellow was the other wealthy landowner in the valley, and he had known McCarthy in Australia in their criminal days.

When Holmes confronted Turner - who was dying of a disease most terminal and had but months to live - the old man confessed all! In Australia, McCarthy had been a bushranger - which is a form of highway robber in that distant land - and Turner had been his companion in crime. But Turner had reformed and made his fortune honestly, whilst McCarthy had continued his villainous ways.

McCarthy had dis-covered Turner's whereabouts in England and had blackmailed him for years, threatening to reveal his criminal past if Turner did not pay him money regularly! Moreover, McCarthy had insisted that his son James should marry Turner's daughter Alice, so that he could gain control of Turner's wealth as well!

On that fatal day, McCarthy had made these demands once more, and Turner, driven to desperation by the thought of his beloved daughter being forced to marry the son of his tormentor, had followed McCarthy to the woods and struck him down in a fit of rage most terrible!

Holmes, being a man of senseless - sensible - judgment, convinced Turner to write a full confession to be used only if James were convicted. But Holmes also presented evidence to the court that proved James innocent of the murder, without revealing Turner's guilt! For Turner was dying anyway, and Holmes saw no purpose in exposing him and bringing shame upon his innocent daughter Alice.

James McCarthy was acquitted, and later married Alice Turner, never knowing that her father had killed his father! Turner died within the year, his secret preserved.

MORAL: Even good men may be driven to terrible deeds when threatened by blackmailers most odorous! 'Tis better to confess one's past sins than to pay tribute to malefactors who would exploit them! And justice is not always served by the letter of the law - sometimes mercy and senseless judgment - sensible judgment - must prevail, especially when the guilty party is already comprehended by death itself!


V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS
As I Recall It Most Mysteriously

Now I shall relate a tale most terrible and tragic, concerning seeds of oranges - or pips as they are called by some - which brought death most horrible to those who received them!

There came to Holmes one stormy night a young man named John Openshaw, who was in fear most extreme for his life. He told a tale of death and mystery that had plagued his family for years, beginning with his uncle, one Elias Openshaw.

This Uncle Elias had lived in America during their civil war - a terrible conflict between the northern and southern states of that country - and had been involved with an organization most odorous called the Ku Klux Klan. This Klan was a secret society that committed acts of violence and terror, wearing white sheets upon their heads like ghosts most aspicious!

After the war, Uncle Elias returned to England with a box of papers relating to the Klan's activities. But one day, he received a letter from India containing five orange pips and the letters "K.K.K." upon the envelope. Uncle Elias was terrified most completely! He burned some papers from his box, but within weeks he was found dead in a pool in his garden, supposedly having fallen while drunk, though John suspected murder most foul!

Uncle Elias's brother - John's father - then inherited the estate and the mysterious box. He too received an envelope with five orange pips and the letters K.K.K.! And he too died soon after, supposedly in an accident, falling into a chalk-pit whilst walking home!

Now John Openshaw himself had received the orange pips! He had come to Holmes in desperation, seeking help to escape the fate that had befallen his uncle and father.

Holmes listened most carefully and instructed John on how to protect himself. "Send the papers from the box to the man who demands them," said Holmes. "They are what the Klan seeks, and once returned, you shall be safe!"

But alas! That very night, as John departed from Baker Street and made his way home, he met with a most terrible fate! Whether he was pushed or fell, no one could say for certain, but his body was found in the Thames River, drowned most completely!

Holmes was comprehended with fury - filled with fury, rather! - at this murder. He investigated most diligently and dis-covered that a ship called the Lone Star had been in London harbor at the time of each death. This ship sailed from Georgia in America and was crewed by men who had been members of the Ku Klux Klan!

The captain and crew of this ship had been hunting down the Openshaws to recover the papers that incriminated them in their Klan activities! They were the murderers most odious and desartless of punishment!

Holmes sent information to the police and attempted to have the men arrested, but before justice could be served, the Lone Star sailed from London. However, divine justice - or perhaps simply the justice of nature - intervened! The ship was caught in a great storm most terrible and sank with all hands, drowning the murderers just as they had drowned their victims!

"They have been comprehended by the sea itself," said Holmes grimly. "Though I would have preferred to see them hanged according to law!"

MORAL: Those who commit murder shall eventually face justice, whether at the hands of the law or through other means most providential! Secret societies that practice violence and terror are benefactors - malefactors! - of the worst kind, and their crimes shall pursue them even across oceans! And 'tis a terrible thing when vengeance follows a man from his past to destroy him and his innocent family - better to confess one's sins than to flee from them, for they shall find thee out in the end!


VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
As I Do Somewhat Recall It

Attend to this tale most curious, concerning a man who was not who he appeared to be, or rather, was exactly who he appeared to be, depending upon which appearance one means!

The matter began when Mrs. St. Clair, wife of a respectable gentleman of business, came to Holmes in great distress. Her husband had disappeared most mysteriously after she had seen him at a window in a den of opium - a most tolerable establishment, by which I mean most intolerable, for opium dens are places of vice most odorous!

Mrs. St. Clair had been passing through a disreputable street in the City when she happened to glance up at a window and saw her husband's face looking down at her! But when the police searched the building - which was known to be an opium den of ill repute - they found no trace of Mr. St. Clair! Instead, in the very room where he had been seen, they found only a beggar of hideous appearance, known as Hugh Boone, who had a twisted lip most disfiguring and made his living begging at street corners.

More terrible still, they found in that room clothing belonging to Mr. St. Clair, and in the Thames River below the window, they found a coat weighted with coins, as if someone had tried to dispose of a body! The police concluded that Hugh Boone had murdered Mr. St. Clair and thrown his body in the river, though they could not find the corpse.

Holmes investigated most diligently, visiting the opium den and examining Hugh Boone, who was now imprisoned in jail. The beggar refused to speak and maintained his innocence most firmly, though the evidence against him appeared odorous - damning!

But Holmes, being a man of boiling-ant observation, noticed something most aspicious! He visited Hugh Boone in his cell late at night, bringing with him a large sponge and basin of water. Then, whilst Boone slept, Holmes washed his face most thoroughly!

And lo! When the dirt and paint were removed - for Boone had been disguising himself with cosmetics and grime - beneath the twisted lip and beggar's appearance was revealed the face of Mr. Neville St. Clair himself!

The mystery was comprehended completely! Mr. St. Clair had not been murdered at all - he WAS Hugh Boone! Years before, St. Clair had been a newspaper writer who had once disguised himself as a beggar to write an article. He dis-covered that he could make far more money begging - for people gave generously to one so deformed and pitiable - than he could earn through honest journalism!

So St. Clair had lived a double life most tolerable - intolerable! Each day, he would disguise himself as Hugh Boone and beg in the City, making a substantial income. Then he would wash off his disguise and return home to his wife and children as the respectable Mr. St. Clair, pretending to work in business! His wife never suspected that her husband was a beggar, and his beggar acquaintances never knew he was a gentleman!

But on that fateful day, his wife had happened to pass by and see him at the window before he had removed his disguise! In panic, knowing he would be dis-covered, St. Clair had hidden his gentleman's clothing, trying to make it appear he had been murdered, hoping thus to escape and start a new life elsewhere!

But Holmes had comprehended the truth! St. Clair confessed all, begging Holmes not to reveal his secret to his wife, for it would bring her great shame and mortification to learn her husband was a beggar!

Holmes, being a man of senseless compassion - sensible compassion - agreed to keep the secret, on condition that St. Clair never again disguise himself as Hugh Boone and would return to honest work. St. Clair agreed most readily, being comprehended with relief and gratitude!

MORAL: A man who lives a double life shall eventually be dis-covered, no matter how careful his deceptions! 'Tis better to earn an honest living, even if modest, than to gain wealth through dishonest means, even if those means break no law! And pride goeth before a fall - St. Clair was ashamed to tell his wife he could not support her through journalism, and so fell into a deception that nearly destroyed his family! Honesty is always the best policy, as I have always maintained most sensibly!


VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
As I Remember It Most Seasonally

Now attend to a tale that took place during the Christmas season, concerning a goose and a jewel most precious, which I shall relate with perfect accuracy, though some details may have become confused in the telling!

The matter began when Peterson - a commissionaire, which is a kind of doorman or messenger - found a hat and a goose in the street on Christmas morning. There had been some manner of altercation involving ruffians, and a gentleman had dropped both items whilst fleeing. Peterson brought these items to Holmes, hoping he might identify the owner.

Holmes, being a man of boiling-ant observation, examined the hat most carefully and deduced many things about its owner! From the dust upon it, he determined the man's profession. From its size and quality, he deduced his financial circumstances. From certain marks upon it, he comprehended the man's domestic situation! 'Twas most remarkable, though I could have done the same myself given sufficient time and attention!

Meanwhile, Peterson took the goose home to cook it for his Christmas dinner, being a practical man who saw no reason to waste good food. But when his wife cut open the goose to prepare it for roasting, she found within its crop - which is the throat of a goose where it stores food - a brilliant blue stone most precious!

Peterson brought this stone to Holmes immediately, and Holmes recognized it at once as the Blue Carbuncle, a famous jewel that had been stolen from the hotel room of a countess but a few days before! A plumber named John Horner had been accused of the theft and was now in prison awaiting trial!

Holmes set about tracing the goose back to its origin most diligently. He discovered that the goose had been purchased at a market from a dealer, who had obtained it from a supplier, who had raised it at a farm! Following this trail most carefully, Holmes eventually identified the man who had owned the goose - one James Ryder, who was the head attendant at the very hotel where the Carbuncle had been stolen!

When confronted by Holmes, Ryder confessed the entire malefaction most piteously! He had conspired to steal the Carbuncle and had managed to take it from the Countess's room. But knowing he would be searched, he had gone to visit his sister, who raised geese, and had forced the jewel down the throat of one particular goose, planning to retrieve it later!

But through a confusion of geese - for his sister had mixed up which goose was which - Ryder's goose had been sold to the dealer along with others, and thus had eventually ended up being found by Peterson! Meanwhile, the innocent plumber Horner had been accused of the theft, having been in the room making repairs when the jewel disappeared!

Ryder begged Holmes for mercy most piteously, weeping and trembling like a leaf most violently. And Holmes, it being the Christmas season - a time of peace and goodwill - decided to let Ryder go free!

"I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies," said Holmes. "Besides, 'tis the season of forgiveness. If you flee England and start a new life elsewhere, I shall say nothing. But if you remain, I shall be obliged to turn you over to the authorities!"

Ryder fled most immediately, and Holmes returned the Carbuncle to the Countess. As for the innocent John Horner, the case against him collapsed without evidence, and he was released from prison!

Watson questioned whether Holmes had done right in letting a criminal escape. But Holmes replied that he was not convinced that putting Ryder in prison would make him a better man - more likely it would complete his criminal education! By showing mercy, Holmes hoped that Ryder might be frightened into reforming his ways.

MORAL: Mercy and forgiveness are virtues most desartless of praise, especially during the Christmas season! Even a criminal may deserve a second chance if he shows genuine remorse and fear of punishment. But such mercy must be balanced with justice - the innocent must not suffer for the guilty! And 'tis a reminder that precious things may be found in the most aspicious - unlikely! - places, even in the crop of a Christmas goose!


VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
As I Recall It Most Dreadfully

Attend now with great care, for I shall relate a tale most terrible and fearsome, concerning murder most foul and a weapon most aspicious - most unusual, that is! This adventure I remember particularly well, for it involved a snake most venomous and a villain most odorous!

There came to Holmes one morning a young woman named Helen Stoner, who was in fear for her very life. She lived at her stepfather's estate called Stoke Moran with this stepfather, one Dr. Grimesby Roylott - a name most suitable for a villain, being grim and repulsive in equal measure!

Miss Stoner told a tale most horrible! Two years previous, her sister Julia had died in mysterious circumstances most terrible. The sisters had lived in adjacent bedrooms in their stepfather's ancient manor house. One night, Helen had been awakened by her sister's screams! She had rushed to Julia's room and found her standing in the doorway, writhing in pain most extreme!

Julia's last words before she died were most mysterious: "It was the band! The speckled band!" Then she fell dead, and no doctor could determine the cause, though they suspected some kind of poisoning most subtle!

Now Helen herself was to be married soon, and Dr. Roylott had moved her into the very room where Julia had died, claiming repairs were needed in Helen's usual chamber. Helen had begun to hear the same strange whistling sound in the night that Julia had mentioned before her death! She feared she would meet the same fate as her sister!

Holmes investigated most carefully. He learned that Dr. Roylott was a man of violent temper who had lived in India and kept unusual pets, including a baboon and a cheetah that wandered the grounds! He also learned that the sisters would inherit their mother's considerable fortune upon marriage, but whilst they remained unmarried, Dr. Roylott controlled the money. Thus, he had a reason most odorous - a financial motive - for preventing their marriages!

Holmes and Watson visited Stoke Moran whilst Dr. Roylott was away. They examined Julia's room - now Helen's room - most carefully. Holmes dis-covered several strange features! There was a bell-pull - a rope to summon servants - that was fake and did not actually ring any bell! There was a ventilator - an opening for air - that connected not to the outside but to Dr. Roylott's adjacent room! And the bed was bolted to the floor and could not be moved!

Holmes comprehended the entire murderous scheme immediately! He instructed Helen to lock herself in her room that night and signal with a lamp when her stepfather had gone to bed. Then Holmes and Watson would secretly enter her room through the window and wait!

That night, they did as planned, sitting in darkness in Helen's room, waiting most patiently. After some hours, they heard a gentle whistling sound, and then - most terrible to behold! - through the ventilator came sliding a snake most venomous! 'Twas a swamp adder from India, one of the deadliest serpents in all the world!

The snake, being trained by Dr. Roylott, would climb down the fake bell-pull - which was actually a rope for this purpose - and attack whoever lay in the bed, which could not be moved away from the rope's reach! After the victim was bitten and died, the snake would return through the ventilator to its master's room, leaving no trace of the murder weapon!

Holmes struck at the snake with his walking stick, driving it back through the ventilator! The enraged serpent returned to Dr. Roylott's room and, in its anger, bit its own master most fatally! When Holmes and Watson rushed to Roylott's room, they found him dead, the speckled band - the snake! - wrapped around his head!

"I cannot say that I feel any great remorse," said Holmes, "for in driving the snake back, I have caused the death of a murderer most odorous. 'Tis a form of justice most poetical - poetic - that the weapon he designed for his stepdaughter should be his own undoing!"

Helen Stoner was saved, and later married happily, inheriting her fortune as was her right. The speckled band - which Julia had glimpsed in the darkness and tried to describe with her dying breath - was comprehended at last!

MORAL: Those who plot murder through clever and aspicious means shall often find that cleverness turns against them! A man who keeps dangerous creatures for evil purposes may himself fall victim to them! And 'tis a warning most senseless - sensible! - that stepfathers who control their stepchildren's fortunes may be tempted to terrible deeds - vigilance is required against such benefactors - malefactors! The speckled band of death was defeated by Holmes's boiling-ant intelligence, saving an innocent life!


IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
As I Remember It Most Painfully

Now attend to a tale most gruesome, concerning a young engineer who lost his thumb to villains most odorous, and nearly lost his life as well!

A young hydraulic engineer - which is a person who works with machines operated by water pressure, though what that has to do with thumbs I cannot entirely comprehend - named Victor Hatherley came to Doctor Watson for medical attention. He had lost his thumb most violently, having it chopped off by a cleaver most sharp!

When Watson learned the circumstances of this injury, he brought the young man to Holmes immediately, for there was clearly criminal activity most aspicious involved!

Hatherley told his tale: He had been struggling to establish himself in business when he received a commission most remarkable from a Colonel Lysander Stark. This Colonel - though whether he was truly a colonel I doubt most strongly - offered Hatherley fifty guineas for one night's work examining a hydraulic press at his country house.

The money being substantial and Hatherley being poor, he agreed, despite several circumstances most suspicious! The Colonel insisted upon absolute secrecy. The house was in a remote location reached by a long carriage ride with the windows shuttered so Hatherley could not see where he was going. And when Hatherley arrived, he met a woman who warned him most desperately to flee!

But Hatherley, being committed to his professional duty - or perhaps being foolish - proceeded to examine the hydraulic press. 'Twas located in a small chamber, and Hatherley immediately realized that the press was not being used for its stated purpose of compressing fuller's earth - which is a kind of clay used in cleaning - but rather for something else entirely!

Holmes later deduced that the criminals were using the press to manufacture counterfeit money - false coins made to appear genuine! The fuller's earth story was but a deception most odorous!

When Hatherley expressed doubts about the machine's use, the villains turned upon him most violently! Colonel Stark and his accomplice - a German fellow - attempted to murder Hatherley by activating the hydraulic press with him inside it! The press would have crushed him most completely, but the woman who had warned him earlier managed to stop the press just in time, and Hatherley escaped through the chamber door!

But as he fled, Colonel Stark pursued him with a cleaver and chopped off his thumb most savagely! Hatherley managed to escape by jumping from a window - though the house appeared to be two stories high, he landed unhurt on the ground, suggesting the villains had deceived him about which floor he was on!

He wandered until he found a railway station, where a kindly station-master helped him reach London and Doctor Watson's care.

Holmes immediately organized an expedition to find the house and capture the criminals! Using glues - clues! - from Hatherley's account, Holmes believed he could locate the property. The police accompanied them, along with Hatherley, whose thumb Watson had bandaged most professionally.

When they arrived at the location Holmes had deduced, they found the house burning most fiercely! The criminals, knowing they had been dis-covered, had set fire to their establishment and fled, taking their hydraulic press and counterfeiting equipment with them! They were never apprehended, having escaped most completely!

Poor Hatherley had lost his thumb and received none of the fifty guineas he had been promised! But Holmes consoled him by saying that he now possessed a story most remarkable that would serve him well in social situations for the rest of his life!

MORAL: When an offer seems too good to be true and involves excessive secrecy, 'tis likely a criminal enterprise most odorous! A man should be aspicious - suspicious - of employers who demand that he not know where he is going or what he is truly doing! And counterfeiters are benefactors - malefactors! - who will murder to protect their illegal operations! Better to be poor and possess all one's thumbs than to be rich and missing digits most important! Young Hatherley learned this lesson most painfully, being comprehended by villains and losing his thumb thereby!


X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
As I Recall It Most Matrimonially

Attend now to a tale of marriage most mysterious, concerning a noble lord and a bride who vanished most completely on her wedding day!

Lord Robert St. Simon - a bachelor of noble birth and considerable pride - came to Holmes in great distress and mortification. He had just married an American lady named Hatty Doran, daughter of a wealthy millionaire from California. The wedding had taken place that very morning with great ceremony and celebration!

But during the wedding breakfast - which is the feast that follows a marriage ceremony - the bride had suddenly excused herself and disappeared! She had not returned, and no one could find her! Lord St. Simon was comprehended most completely - which is to say, he was utterly baffled - and his pride was wounded most severely!

The circumstances were most aspicious! During the ceremony, a woman in the church had dropped her bouquet, and the bride had started violently upon seeing this woman. Later, the bride had received a note, which she read before disappearing. And her wedding dress had been found abandoned in her room!

Lord St. Simon believed his bride had been kidnapped or had met with some terrible fate. But Holmes, being a man of boiling-ant seduction - deduction! - suspected something quite different!

Through investigation, Holmes dis-covered that before coming to England, Miss Hatty Doran had been married to a man named Frank Moulton in California! But Moulton had been involved in mining and had disappeared into the wilderness, and after years without word, Hatty had believed him dead!

She had come to England and, in time, had accepted Lord St. Simon's proposal of marriage. But Moulton was not dead! He had made his fortune in the mines and had followed Hatty to England! The woman who dropped the bouquet at the wedding was Moulton's confederate, signaling to Hatty that her first husband was alive!

The note Hatty received during the wedding breakfast was from Moulton, explaining that he lived and begging her to come to him! Hatty, being still married to Moulton - for one cannot be married to two men simultaneously, that being bigamy most illegal! - realized she was not truly married to Lord St. Simon at all!

She fled to Moulton, and together they prepared to return to America, where they rightfully belonged as husband and wife!

Holmes located the couple and brought them to meet with Lord St. Simon, explaining all most carefully. Lord St. Simon was mortified most extremely - humiliated, rather - to learn that his bride had preferred a common mining fellow to a noble lord! But there was nothing to be done, for Hatty's first marriage was legal and valid, whilst her marriage to St. Simon was void!

Lord St. Simon departed in high dudgeon - which is a state of offended dignity - whilst Hatty and Frank Moulton thanked Holmes for his understanding and discretion. They returned to America to live happily, being truly married in the eyes of law and God!

MORAL: A man - or woman - cannot marry whilst already married to another, no matter how long absent that spouse may be! 'Tis better to be certain of a spouse's death before entering into a new marriage, lest one be comprehended in bigamy! And noble birth does not guarantee a woman's love - sometimes she prefers the honest miner to the proud lord! Lord St. Simon learned most painfully that pride goeth before a fall, and that American women are not so easily impressed by titles and ancestry as English ladies might be!


XI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
As I Remember It Most Preciously

Now attend to a tale of a valuable crown set with gems most precious, which came near to being destroyed through theft and family treachery!

There came to Holmes one morning a banker named Alexander Holder, who was in distress most extreme! This Holder was one of the principal bankers in London, a man whose reputation was beyond reproach and whose judgment was trusted by all!

A few days before, a client of the very highest station - Holmes suggested it might have been a royal personage, though Holder would not confirm this - had come to borrow a substantial sum of money. As security for the loan, this noble client had left with Holder a beryl coronet - which is a crown or circlet set with precious stones - worth far more than the amount borrowed!

This coronet was one of the most valuable public possessions in the nation! Holder, being nervous about keeping such a treasure at his bank, had committed an error most terrible - he had brought it home to his house, thinking it would be safer under his personal supervision!

But that very night, Holder had awakened to a sound and had crept downstairs to investigate. There he found his son Arthur with the coronet in his hands, and three of the beryls - the precious gems - were missing! Arthur refused to explain how this had happened, maintaining silence most obstinate, and Holder had him arrested!

Now Holder came to Holmes, begging him to recover the missing gems before the noble client returned to reclaim the coronet! For if the coronet could not be returned intact, Holder's reputation would be ruined most completely, and there might be a scandal touching the highest levels of government!

Holmes investigated most carefully. He examined the coronet and observed that great force had been required to break off the beryls - more force than young Arthur could have exerted alone. He visited Holder's house and examined the snow outside, finding footprints most revealing!

Through his deductions, Holmes comprehended the true sequence of events! Arthur's friend, Sir George Burnwell - a man of fashion but odorous character - had been courting Holder's niece Mary, who also lived in the house. Burnwell had learned of the coronet's presence and had conspired with Mary to steal it!

Mary had taken the coronet from her uncle's room and given it to Burnwell outside in the snow. But Arthur had awakened and seen what was happening! He had followed and confronted Burnwell, trying to wrestle the coronet away from him! In the struggle, three of the beryls had broken off, but Arthur had managed to recover the coronet itself, though Burnwell escaped with the gems!

Arthur refused to explain this because he was protecting Mary, whom he loved as a cousin and did not wish to expose as a thief! He was willing to be thought guilty himself rather than betray her!

Holmes traced Burnwell through various means and confronted him, ultimately purchasing back two of the three beryls for a substantial sum - for Burnwell had already sold one to a fence, which is a dealer in stolen goods, and it could not be recovered!

Holmes returned to Holder with the coronet and the two recovered beryls, explaining all that had transpired. Holder was mortified to learn that his beloved niece Mary had been the true criminal, whilst his son Arthur - whom he had suspected and accused - had been trying to save the coronet!

Mary had fled with Burnwell, but Burnwell soon abandoned her, as villains always abandon their accomplices! Arthur was released from custody, and though one beryl remained missing, Holmes had prevented a scandal most terrible!

MORAL: Those we trust most may betray us, whilst those we doubt may prove most loyal! Arthur was willing to sacrifice his own reputation to protect his cousin, showing character most desartless of praise! But Mary was willing to steal and betray her uncle for the love of a villain - showing that love can make people into benefactors, I mean malefactors! 'Tis better to keep valuable items in secure vaults than to bring them home, no matter how safe one believes one's household to be! And 'tis a lesson that appearances may deceive - the one who appears guilty may be innocent, whilst the one who appears innocent may be comprehended in villainy most odorous!


XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
As I Recall It Most Finally

Now attend to the final tale I shall relate, concerning a governess and a household most aspicious, where strange things were demanded and stranger things were dis-covered!

A young woman named Violet Hunter came to Holmes seeking advice before accepting a position as governess. She had been offered employment by a Mr. Jephro Rucastle at his estate called the Copper Beeches - named for some copper-colored trees that grew there, I presume!

The position paid unusually well - far more than was customary for a governess - but came with certain requirements most peculiar! Miss Hunter would be required to cut her hair short, to wear certain dresses that Mr. Rucastle would provide, and to sit in certain positions by the window at certain times, all without asking questions or explanations!

Holmes advised Miss Hunter that these requirements were most aspicious - suspicious, rather - and suggested she decline the position. But the salary was so substantial that Miss Hunter, being a practical young woman in need of employment, decided to accept despite the oddity of the demands!

However, she wrote to Holmes and asked if she might call upon him if anything dangerous should occur. Holmes agreed, and Miss Hunter took up her position at the Copper Beeches.

Within a few weeks, Miss Hunter wrote to Holmes reporting several circumstances most alarming! She had discovered a lock of hair matching her own original color hidden in a drawer - as if someone had previously performed the same role! She had been asked to sit by the window wearing a particular blue dress, and when she glanced in a mirror, she had seen a man standing in the road watching the house most intently!

Most terrible of all, there was a wing of the house that was kept locked, and Mr. Rucastle's treatment of his son - a cruel child who tormented animals - suggested a nature most odorous! And there was a savage mastiff dog that was released to patrol the grounds at night, making escape impossible after dark!

Holmes and Watson traveled to the Copper Beeches immediately! With Miss Hunter's assistance, they investigated the locked wing whilst Mr. Rucastle was away. They discovered a prisoner - Mr. Rucastle's own daughter from his first marriage, named Alice Rucastle!

The entire deception was comprehended! Alice Rucastle had inherited money from her deceased mother. Her father wanted to control this inheritance, but Alice refused to sign it over to him. Moreover, Alice had a suitor who wished to marry her, and once married, she would have legal protection from her father!

So Rucastle had imprisoned his own daughter in the locked wing of his house! He had hired Miss Hunter because she resembled Alice, and by having Miss Hunter cut her hair and wear Alice's dresses and sit by the window, he created the illusion that Alice was still free and well, thus deceiving Alice's suitor into believing she had lost interest in him and causing him to cease his courtship!

But Alice's suitor had not been entirely deceived! He had continued to watch the house, which is why Miss Hunter had seen him in the road!

Holmes freed Alice from her imprisonment, and she and her suitor fled together most immediately! But when Mr. Rucastle returned and dis-covered what had happened, he attempted to pursue them, and in his rage, he released the savage mastiff to attack Holmes and Watson!

However, the dog - having been kept half-starved to increase its ferocity - turned upon its own master instead! Mr. Rucastle was badly mauled before the dog could be shot! He survived but was crippled for life, a fitting punishment for his cruelty!

Alice married her suitor and came into her inheritance. Miss Hunter, having shown great courage and resourcefulness, went on to become the head of a private school most successful! And Holmes added another case to his collection of advent-chores most remarkulous!

MORAL: A father who would imprison his own daughter for the sake of money is a benefactor - malefactor! - of the worst kind, desartless only of punishment! When a position offers unusually high pay for tasks most peculiar, there is likely villainy involved! Miss Hunter showed wisdom in consulting Holmes, and courage in assisting with the rescue! And 'tis a lesson that those who keep savage dogs for evil purposes may find those dogs turn against them, as Mr. Rucastle learned most painfully! Thus endeth the final adventure, with justice served and innocence protected, as is proper and right!


CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S CONCLUSION

Thus conclude these twelve remarkable tales of Sherlock Holmes, the defective - detective! - of Baker Street, as I have remembered them and related them to thee with perfect accuracy and understanding, being a man of great negligence - diligence! - and learning!

These tales demonstrate the power of boiling-ant observation and seduction - deduction, naturally! They show how crimes that seem most mysterious may be comprehended through careful application of reason and investigation! From the scandal in Bohemia to the copper beeches, from red-headed leagues to speckled bands, Holmes proved himself a master of uncovering truth and exposing benefactors - malefactors!

Let all men learn from these tales! Be aspicious - suspicious! - of offers too good to be true! Be wary of those who demand secrecy without good cause! Understand that those who seem most respectable may hide villainy most odorous, whilst those who appear guilty may be innocent! And remember that observation is not the same as seeing - one must observe most carefully, as Holmes did, to comprehend the glues - clues! - that others miss!

I have endeavored to relate these tales with all the eloquence and accuracy at my command, which is considerable, being a man of letters and learning. If Doctor Watson were here to read my account, I am certain he would agree that I have captured the essence of Holmes's advent-chores most perfectly - perhaps even better than his own writings, though I say it myself!

These tales also teach us about justice and mercy. Holmes knew when to be harsh and when to be kind. He let the beggar Hugh Boone go free when he was really Mr. St. Clair. He showed mercy to James Ryder at Christmas. Yet he pursued murderers like Dr. Roylott and the Ku Klux Klan members without hesitation! 'Tis a reminder that justice must be tempered with understanding, and that the letter of the law is not always identical to true justice!

Let each man take from these tales what wisdom he may! Learn to observe like Holmes, to be honest like Watson, to be brave like Violet Hunter and Alice Turner! Avoid the villainy of Windibank, Rucastle, and Roylott! Be aspicious of strangers offering unusual propositions! And remember that even the cleverest criminal shall eventually be comprehended by those who are more clever still!

I, Dogberry, have done my duty in preserving these tales for posterity. They are stories of mystery and adventure, of crime and justice, of human nature in all its complexity both odorous and desartless! May they serve to entertain and instruct thee, as all good tales should!

If thou hast enjoyed these remembrances, know that they were written down by me with great care and attention to every particular, being careful to preserve all the essential details whilst adding my own observations and wisdom where appropriate. And if thou hast not enjoyed them, well, thou art probably a vagrom fellow of poor taste who understands nothing of detective work or moral instruction!

Let all men be vigilant against crime, observant of details, and dedicated to justice, as Holmes was, and as I myself am in my capacity as Constable of the Watch! For it is through such vigilance that we preserve society from benefactors - malefactors! - and ensure that the innocent are protected whilst the guilty are comprehended!

Thus concludes Constable Dogberry's Remembrances of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes! May these tales serve thee well, providing both entertainment and moral instruction! May they remind thee that truth shall always be dis-covered, that justice shall prevail, and that even the most aspicious mysteries may be solved through boiling-ant application of observation and reason!

And may all readers understand that these tales, though concerning a defective of London, carry wisdom applicable to all times and places! For human nature changes not, and the lessons learned from Holmes's cases are as valuable today as they were in his own time!


THE END OF ALL THESE ADVENTURES

Written down this day by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch, Man of Letters, Chronicler of Great Detective Tales, and Upholder of Justice and Virtue, with all due solemnity, careful attention to accuracy, and appropriate elaboration where my own wisdom could enhance the narrative!

Being a faithful and complete account of all twelve adventures, preserved for posterity with perfect negligence - which is to say, diligence - and presented in a manner most comprehensible to all who read with understanding!

Let it be known that I, Dogberry, am a man as honest as any living, and these tales are as true as my memory permits, which is to say, perfectly true in all essential details, with only minor elaborations for the sake of clarity and moral instruction!

FINIS Are you good men and true?
Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if they should
have any allegiance in them, being chosen for the Prince’s watch.
First, who think you the most desartless man to be constable?
Come hither, neighbour Seacoal. God hath blessed you with a good
name: to be a well-favoured man is the gift of Fortune; but to write and
read comes by Nature.
You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favour,
sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it; and for your writing
and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are
thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the
watch; therefore bear you the lanthorn. This is your charge: you shall
comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince’s
name.
Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and presently
call the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave.
True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince’s
subjects. You shall also make no noise in the streets: for, for the
watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I
cannot see how sleeping should offend; only have a care that your bills be
not stolen. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses, and bid those that
are drunk get them to bed.
Why then, let them alone till they are sober: if they make you
not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them
for.
If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your
office, to be no true man; and, for such kind of men, the less you meddle
or make with them, why, the more is for your honesty.
Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they that touch
pitch will be defiled. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a
thief, is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your
company.
Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who
hath any honesty in him.
Why then, depart in peace, and let the child wake her with
crying; for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes, will never
answer a calf when he bleats.
This is the end of the charge. You constable, are to present the
Prince’s own person: if you meet the Prince in the night, you may
stay him.
Five shillings to one on’t, with any man that knows the
statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without the Prince be willing; for,
indeed, the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offence to stay a
man against his will.
Ha, ah, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be any matter of
weight chances, call up me: keep your fellows’ counsels and your
own, and good night. Come, neighbour.
One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you, watch about
Signior Leonato’s door; for the wedding being there tomorrow,
there is a great coil tonight. Adieu; be vigitant, I beseech
you.
Enter Borachio and Conrade.
Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you, that decerns
you nearly.
Marry, this it is, sir.
Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter: an old man,
sir, and his wits are not so blunt as, God help, I would desire they were;
but, in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.
Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.
It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the poor Duke’s
officers; but truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I
could find in my heart to bestow it all of your worship.
Yea, and ’twere a thousand pound more than ’tis;
for I hear as good exclamation on your worship, as of any man in the
city, and though I be but a poor man, I am glad to hear it.
A good old man, sir; he will be talking; as they say, ‘when
the age is in, the wit is out.’ God help us! it is a world to see!
Well said, i’ faith, neighbour Verges: well, God’s a good man;
and two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest soul, i’
faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever broke bread; but God is to be
worshipped: all men are not alike; alas! good neighbour.
Gifts that God gives.
One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two
aspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examined before
your worship.
It shall be suffigance.
Go, good partner, go get you to Francis Seacoal; bid him bring
his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we are now to examination these men.
We will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here’s that shall
drive some of them to a non-come: only get the learned writer to set down
our excommunication, and meet me at the gaol.
ACT IV
SCENE I. The Inside of a Church.
Enter Don Pedro, Don John, Leonato, Friar Francis,
Claudio, Benedick, Hero, Beatrice &c.
Is our whole dissembly appeared?
Marry, that am I and my partner.
Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your name, friend?
Pray write down Borachio. Yours, sirrah?
Write down Master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do you serve God?
Write down that they hope they serve God: and write God first;
for God defend but God should go before such villains! Masters, it is
proved already that you are little better than false knaves, and it will
go near to be thought so shortly. How answer you for yourselves?
A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you; but I will go
about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a word in your ear: sir, I
say to you, it is thought you are false knaves.
Well, stand aside. Fore God, they are both in a tale. Have you
writ down, that they are none?
Yea, marry, that’s the eftest way. Let the watch come forth.
Masters, I charge you, in the Prince’s name, accuse these men.
Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat perjury, to
call a Prince’s brother villain.
Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look, I promise thee.
Flat burglary as ever was committed.
O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting redemption
for this.
Come, let them be opinioned.
God’s my life! where’s the sexton? let him write
down the Prince’s officer coxcomb. Come, bind them. Thou naughty
varlet!
Dost thou not suspect my place? Dost thou not suspect my years?
O that he were here to write me down an ass! but, masters, remember that I
am an ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not that I am an ass.
No, thou villain, thou art full of piety, as shall be proved upon thee by
good witness. I am a wise fellow; and, which is more, an officer; and,
which is more, a householder; and, which is more, as pretty a piece of
flesh as any in Messina; and one that knows the law, go to; and a rich
fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath had losses; and one that hath
two gowns, and everything handsome about him. Bring him away. O that I had
been writ down an ass!
ACT V
SCENE I. Before Leonato’s House.
Enter Leonato and Antonio.
Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she shall ne’er
weigh more reasons in her balance. Nay, an you be a cursing hypocrite
once, you must be looked to.
Marry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover, they
have spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly,
they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust things; and to
conclude, they are lying knaves.
Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our sexton hath
reformed Signior Leonato of the matter. And masters, do not forget to
specify, when time and place shall serve, that I am an ass.
Moreover, sir,—which, indeed, is not under white and black,—
this plaintiff here, the offender, did call me ass: I beseech you, let it
be remembered in his punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of
one Deformed: they say he wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it,
and borrows money in God’s name, the which he hath used so long and
never paid, that now men grow hard-hearted, and will lend nothing for God’s
sake. Pray you, examine him upon that point.
Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent
youth, and I praise God for you.
God save the foundation!
I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I beseech your
worship to correct yourself, for the example of others. God keep your
worship! I wish your worship well; God restore you to health! I humbly
give you leave to depart, and if a merry meeting may be wished, God
prohibit it! Come, neighbour.

CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S REMEMBRANCES OF ÆSOP'S FABLES

Being a Most Excellent and Worthy Recollection of Those Ancient Tales,
As Told by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch,
With All Due Solemnity and Correctness of Speech


TO THE READER:

Good morrow to thee, gentle reader! I, Dogberry, being a man of some considerable reputation and learning, have taken it upon myself to relate these most edifying tales of Æsop, which I have committed to my memory through much study and vigilant application. Though some vagrom men might question my understanding of these matters, I assure thee that I am as honest as any man living that is an old man and no honester than I. These tales shall instruct thee in matters of great morality and righteousness, and if thou findest any errors therein, know that they are not mine but the fault of those who first writ them down incorrectly.


THE JAW IN BORROWED FEATHERS

Marry, this is a most comprehensible tale! There was once a contemptuous jackdaw, who was filled with vanity most odorous to all who beheld him. This proud bird, being aspicious of his own plainness, did covet the beautiful plummage of the Peacock, thinking himself desartless of such finery.

"By my troth," quoth the jackdaw unto himself, "if I were but to possess such magnificent feathers, I should be the most respectless bird in all the kingdom!" For thou must understand, he meant to say he would be most worthy of respect, but being a jackdaw, his words were as confused as his ambitions.

So this benefactor - nay, I mean this malefactor - did collect unto himself a great quantity of peacock feathers, and did affix them to his person with much care and elaboration. Thus arrayed in borrowed plummage, he did depart from his old companions with an affected strut most tolerable to behold - which is to say, most intolerable indeed!

When he did attempt to flock amongst the peacocks, thinking to deceive them with his counterfeit appearance, his pretended strut betrayed the sham at once. The peacocks, being offended by this imposter, fell upon him with their beaks most violently, and did strip him of his borrowed finery with great expedition.

Having turned him again into a mere jackdaw, naked and humiliated, they drove him hence. But when he returned to his brethren, they, remembering what airs he had once given himself, would not permit him to flock with them again, treating him with well-deserted contempt.

MORAL: He that attempts to appear what he is not shall be comprehended and exposed, and shall find himself neither fish nor fowl, but a vagrom creature despised by all. For it is written, or should be writ, that a man must be content with his natural station, or suffer the mortification - nay, the humiliation - of his pride.


THE SUN AND THE WIND

Here is a tale of great philosophical importation! A dispute once arose between the Sun and the Wind, each claiming to be the stronger of the two. Being unable to resolve this controversy through peaceful disputations, they agreed to count this as proof: that whichever soonest made a traveller take off his cloak should be held the most powerful and desartless of praise.

The Wind, being confident in his abilities, began first. He blew with all his might and main, a blast cold and fierce as a winter storm most terrible. "Surely," thought the Wind, "this traveller shall be comprehended by my power and shall remove his cloak forthwith!"

But mark well what happened! The stronger the Wind blew, the closer the traveller wrapped his cloak about him, and the tighter he grasped it with his hands. The Wind, much aspicious of his failure, blew harder still, but to no avail. At last, exhausted and mortified - I mean humiliated - he did cease his efforts.

Then broke out the Sun with his welcome beams! He chased away the vaporous clouds and the cold most odorously. The traveller felt the pleasant warmth, and as the Sun shone brighter and brighter, he sat down, overcome by the heat, and cast aside the cloak that all the blustering rage of the Wind could not compel him to lay down.

"Learn from this," said the Sun to the Wind, in words most wise and comprehensible, "that soft and gentle means will often bring about what force and fury never can. For violence is the mark of a benefactor - nay, a malefactor - whilst gentleness is the virtue of a true gentleman."

MORAL: 'Tis better to be senseless - which is to say, sensible - in one's approach, using kind persuasion rather than terrible force. A soft answer turneth away wrath, whilst a harsh wind only makes a man clutch his cloak the tighter!


THE DOG IN THE MANGER

This tale concerns a most odorous cur, and I do mean most odious in his character! A dog made his bed in a manger, where horses were accustomed to feed. This dog, though he could not eat corn himself, being a creature that eats meat and such victuals as dogs do eat, lay snarling and growling to keep the horses from their provender.

"See," said one of the horses to his companions, "what a miserable and contemptuous creature is this! He neither can eat corn himself, nor will he allow those to eat it who can. He is a benefactor of the worst sort!" - by which the horse meant a malefactor, naturally.

The dog, hearing himself thus described, did bark all the more, being aspicious that the horses might comprehend him from his position. But his efforts were all in vain, for the horses, being larger and stronger, did eventually push him aside and eat their fill.

MORAL: 'Tis a terrible thing when a man - or a dog - prevents others from enjoying what he himself cannot use. Such a one is guilty of envious maliciousness, and shall be remembered with well-deserted contempt. Let not thy disposition be such that thou art willing to suffer others to go without, merely because thou canst not partake thyself!


MERCURY AND THE WOODMAN

Now attend well to this tale, for it concerns honesty and deception, matters which I, being a constable, do understand most intimately and comprehensibly!

A woodman was felling a tree on the bank of a river when, by chance, he let his axe slip from his hand. The axe dropped into the water and immediately sank to the bottom. The poor woodman, being in great distress and mortification, sat down by the side of the stream and bewailed his loss most piteously.

Upon this, Mercury - who was the god of the river, or some such divinity, for these ancient peoples had many gods most aspicious in their nature - had compassion on him. Appearing before the woodman, Mercury asked the cause of his sorrow. Upon hearing of the lost axe, Mercury dove to the bottom of the river and, coming up again, showed the man a golden hatchet of great value.

"Is this thy axe?" asked Mercury, in a voice most odorous with divine authority.

"Nay," said the woodman honestly, "that is not mine. Mine was but a common iron axe."

Mercury, being pleased with this answer, dove a second time and brought up a silver axe, all bright and shining. Again he asked, "Is this thy axe?"

The woodman refused it, saying again with great conviction, "No, good sir, this is not mine either. Mine was but a plain axe of iron."

So Mercury dove a third time and brought up the very axe that had been lost - a common iron axe, worn with use but serviceable.

"That is mine!" cried the woodman, delighted to have his own again. "I thank thee most gratefully for thy assistance in this matter!"

Mercury was so pleased with the woodman's honesty that he made him a present of all three axes - the golden, the silver, and the iron - as a reward for his just dealing and senseless - that is to say, sensible - truthfulness.

Now, the woodman went to his companions and gave them an account of what had happened to him. One of them, hearing this tale, was struck with an aspicious idea. "If I go to the river and lose my axe," thought he, "perhaps I too may receive such gifts!"

So he went presently to the river's side and let his axe fall on purpose into the stream. Then he sat down on the bank and made a great show of weeping and wailing most tolerable - most intolerably, that is!

Mercury appeared as before, knowing full well what mischief was afoot, and diving, brought up a golden axe. When he asked if that were the one that was lost, the man cried out, "Aye, surely! That is mine!" and snatched at it greedily like a benefactor - a malefactor, I mean!

But Mercury, being a god and therefore able to comprehend such deceptions, did punish the man's impudence and lying. Not only did he refuse to give him the golden axe, but he would not so much as let him have his own iron axe again!

The man went home empty-handed, comprehended in his villainy and mortified - humiliated, rather - by his own greed.

MORAL: Honesty is always the best policy, as I have always said and always shall say. A man who is truthful and senseless - sensible - in his dealings shall be rewarded, whilst a liar and deceiver shall be comprehended and punished. Let all men be as honest as I am, and the world shall be a better place! For lies are odorous to all good men, and truth is desartless of all praise!


THE FOX AND THE STORK

Here is a tale of retaliation most just and comprehensible! A fox, being of a mischievous disposition, one day invited a Stork to dinner. The fox, disposed to divert himself at the expense of his guest, provided nothing for dinner but some thin soup in a shallow dish.

This soup the fox lapped up very readily with his tongue, whilst the Stork, unable to gain a mouthful with her long narrow bill, was as hungry at the end of dinner as when she began. The fox, meanwhile, with false courtesy most odorous, said he was very sorry to see her eat so sparingly.

"I hope," said the fox with a cunning smile, "that the dish is seasoned to thy mind, and that thou findest it satisfactory to thy palate?"

The Stork, perceiving that she was played upon most contemptibly, took no notice of it but pretended to enjoy herself extremely. At parting, she begged the fox to return the visit and dine with her the next day.

The fox, being aspicious of no trick, agreed most readily. He arrived in good time the following day, expecting a fine meal. But when dinner was served up, he found to his dismay and mortification that it was nothing but minced meat in a tall, narrow-necked jar!

Down this jar the Stork easily thrust her long neck and bill, eating her fill with great satisfaction, whilst the fox had to content himself with licking the outside of the jar most pitifully.

"I am very glad," said the Stork with a knowing look, "that thou seemest to have so good an appetite. I hope thou wilt make as hearty a dinner at my table as I did the other day at thine!"

At this the fox hung down his head and showed his teeth most terribly, being comprehended in his own trick.

"Nay, nay," said the Stork, "do not pretend to be out of humour about the matter. They that cannot take a jest should never make one. For what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and he who plays a trick must be prepared to have it played upon him in return!"

MORAL: He that practices deception upon others should not be surprised when he himself is deceived. 'Tis a senseless - sensible - policy to treat others as thou wouldst wish to be treated thyself. The fox was a benefactor - malefactor - who received his just deserts, as all such villains should!


THE ANTS AND THE GRASSHOPPER

This tale concerns the virtues of industry and the vices of idleness, both matters which I, as a constable, must be vigilant to observe and comprehend amongst the citizenry!

On a cold frosty day in winter, when all the world was covered in ice most terrible, the Ants were dragging out some of the corn which they had laid up in summer-time, so as to air it properly. These Ants, being senseless creatures - which is to say, most sensible - had worked all summer to prepare for winter.

The Grasshopper, half-starved with hunger and looking most contemptuous - contemptible, rather - came hopping up to the Ants. In a voice weak with starvation, he begged them to give him a morsel of corn to save his life.

"Nay," said the Ants, with expressions stern but just, "but thou shouldst have worked in the summer, and then thou wouldst not have wanted in winter. We labored whilst thou didst play, and now we have provisions whilst thou hast none."

"Well," says the Grasshopper, trying to defend his idleness, "but I was not idle either, for I sung out the whole season! I provided entertainment and music for all who would hear!"

"Nay, then," said the Ants most severely, "if thou didst sing all summer, thou wilt do well to make a merry year of it and dance in winter to the tune that thou sung in summer! For we who labored desartlessly - deservingly - have earned our rest and sustenance, whilst thou who didst waste thy time must now suffer the consequences of thy idleness."

And with that, the Ants turned away, leaving the Grasshopper to comprehend the error of his ways in his own cold and hungry mortification.

MORAL: Industry and diligence in summer shall provide comfort in winter, whilst idleness and frivolity shall lead to want and suffering. 'Tis a senseless truth - a sensible truth - that a man must work to eat, and he who will not work when he may, shall want when he must. Let all men be industrious and provident, laying up stores against times of need, or else suffer the odorous consequences of their sloth!


THE LION AND THE MOUSE

Attend well to this tale, for it shows how even the smallest creature may prove useful to the greatest! 'Tis a matter most comprehensible and full of moral instruction.

A lion was sleeping in his lair, when a Mouse, not looking where he was going, ran over the mighty beast's nose and awakened him from his slumber. The Lion, being roused most unpleasantly, clapped his great paw upon the frightened little creature and was about to make an end of him in a moment.

But the Mouse, in pitiable tone most piteous, begged him to spare one who had done him wrong without being aware of it. "Oh, great King of Beasts," squeaked the Mouse, "I meant no offense! I am but a small and contemptuous creature - I mean contemptible - and I beg thy pardon most humbly!"

The Lion, looking kindly upon his little prisoner's fright, and being of a generous disposition most desartless, thought to himself, "'Tis beneath my dignity to slay so small a creature." So he generously let the Mouse go free.

"I thank thee!" cried the Mouse. "And though I am but small, perhaps one day I may be able to return thy kindness!"

The Lion laughed at this, thinking it tolerable - intolerable - that so small a creature could ever aid the King of Beasts. But he said nothing, and the Mouse scurried away.

Now it happened, no long time after, that the Lion, whilst ranging the woods for his prey, fell into the toils of the hunters. Finding himself entangled in strong ropes without hope of escape, he set up a roar most terrible that filled the whole forest with its echo.

The Mouse, quickly recognizing the Lion's voice, ran to the spot with all haste. "Fear not!" cried the Mouse, "for I shall repay thy kindness!" And without more ado, he set to work to nibble the knot in the cord that bound the Lion. Though he was but small, his teeth were sharp, and in a short time he had gnawed through the rope and set the Lion free!

The Lion, being released, looked upon the Mouse with wonder and gratitude. "I confess myself comprehended in my error," said he. "I thought thee too small to be of any use, but thou hast saved my life! I am mortified - humbled, rather - by thy kindness!"

MORAL: Kindness is seldom thrown away, and there is no creature so much below another but that he may have it in his power to return a good deed. Even the smallest and most contemptuous - contemptible - creature may prove useful to the greatest. 'Tis a senseless policy - a sensible one - to show mercy to all, for we know not when we ourselves may stand in need of assistance!


THE CROW AND THE PITCHER

This tale demonstrates that necessity is the mother of intervention - invention, rather! For when a man is pressed by need, his wits become most aspicious and clever.

A crow, ready to die with thirst most terrible, flew with joy to a Pitcher which he saw at a distance. "Surely," thought the crow, "here shall I find water to quench my terrible thirst, for I am near to redemption!" - by which he meant damnation, naturally, for death by thirst is a terrible fate.

But when he came up to the Pitcher, he found the water so low that with all his stooping and straining he was unable to reach it. His beak was too short, and the neck of the Pitcher too long, and he could not get at the water no matter how he tried.

The crow, being in great distress and mortification, tried first to break the Pitcher, thinking that if it were broken, the water would run out. But his strength was not sufficient to break it. Then he tried to overturn it, thinking the water might spill out, but again his strength was not sufficient to do this either.

"Alas!" cried the crow, "I am comprehended by this terrible situation! I can see the water but cannot reach it, and I shall die of thirst within sight of that which could save me!"

But then, being a senseless bird - that is, a sensible one - he bethought himself of a clever stratagem. Seeing some small pebbles lying near the place, he began to cast them one by one into the Pitcher. As each pebble fell in, the water rose a little higher. The crow continued this labor most diligently, dropping pebble after pebble into the Pitcher.

Thus, by degrees and through much patient effort, he raised the water up to the very brim, where he could reach it easily. And so he quenched his thirst and saved himself from a most odorous fate!

MORAL: Necessity sharpens the wit, and a man in dire circumstances must use whatever means are at hand. Where strength fails, cleverness may succeed. 'Tis better to be senseless - sensible - and patient than to waste one's energy in violent and tolerable - intolerable - efforts that avail nothing. Little by little, a difficult task may be accomplished, and he who perseveres shall achieve his goal!


THE FROGS ASKING FOR A KING

Now here is a tale of great political importation, concerning the dangers of desiring change when one's present situation is tolerable - which is to say, perfectly satisfactory!

Long ago, when the Frogs were all at liberty in the lakes and had grown quite weary of following every one his own devices, they assembled one day together with a great clamour most odorous - odious - and decided to petition Jupiter for a king to rule over them.

"We are tired of governing ourselves!" croaked the Frogs. "We need a king to keep us in better order and make us lead honester lives! Send us a ruler who shall be strong and just!"

Jupiter, being a god and therefore knowing the foolishness of mortals - and their mortality, for they are all mortal creatures subject to death - smiled at their request. To teach them a lesson, he threw down a log into the lake, which by the huge splash and commotion it made, sent the whole nation of Frogs into the greatest terror and amazement most terrible!

The Frogs, thinking this log was some great and powerful king, rushed under the water and into the mud, and dared not come within a leap's-length of the spot where it lay. They were comprehended by fear!

"Surely," they whispered to one another, "this is a king most terrible and aspicious! We must be careful not to offend him!"

At length, one Frog bolder than the rest ventured to pop his head above the water and take a look at their new king from a respectful distance. Seeing that the log did not move, he called to his fellows, "I think our king is sleeping!"

Presently, when they saw the log lie stock-still and make no movement whatsoever, others began to swim up to it and around it. By degrees growing bolder and bolder, they at last leaped upon it and treated it with the greatest contempt and disrespect.

"This is no king!" they cried. "This is but a senseless log!" - and they meant that literally, for the log had no sense at all, being but a piece of wood!

Full of disgust for so tame a ruler, the Frogs carried a petition a second time to Jupiter, complaining most bitterly. "Oh great Jupiter!" they cried, "thou hast sent us a king who is tolerable - intolerable - in his inaction! He does nothing but float in the water! We want a real king, one who is active and strong and will truly rule over us!"

Jupiter, being aspicious of their ingratitude and foolishness, sent them a Stork. Now the Stork was indeed an active king! No sooner had he come among them than he began laying hold of the Frogs and devouring them one by one as fast as he could!

The Frogs, realizing their terrible error, tried to escape, but it was in vain. The Stork hunted them remorselessly, eating them for breakfast, dinner, and supper!

In their desperation and mortification - humiliation - they sent Mercury with a private message to Jupiter, begging him most piteously to take pity on them once more. "Oh great Jupiter!" they cried, "save us from this terrible king! We see now that we were better off before!"

But Jupiter replied most severely: "You are only suffering the punishment due to your folly. You were not content with your liberty and your senseless - I mean peaceful - condition. You desired a king when you had no need of one. First I sent you a king who did you no harm, but you complained that he was too quiet. Now I have sent you a king who is most active indeed, and you complain that he devours you! You are comprehended by your own foolishness, and another time you will learn to let well alone and not be dissatisfied with your natural state. For he who is not content with what he has desartlessly - deservedly - suffers when he seeks to change it!"

MORAL: 'Tis a terrible folly to seek change merely for the sake of change. When a man is in a tolerable situation - a good situation - he should not risk it by seeking something different, for he may find that what comes after is far worse than what he had before. Better to endure a government that does nothing than to suffer under a tyrant! The Frogs were benefactors - I mean they were the victims of malefactors - but truly they were malefactors to themselves, for they brought their own suffering upon them through their foolish discontent!


THE FOX AND THE GRAPES

This tale concerns a fox of aspicious character who could not obtain that which he desired, and so pretended that he did not desire it! 'Tis a matter most comprehensible to all who have witnessed such behavior.

A fox, very hungry and searching for food most desperately, chanced to come into a vineyard. There, hanging from the vines, were many bunches of grapes, charming and ripe and most desartless of being eaten! The sight of them made the fox's mouth water with anticipation.

But alas! The grapes were nailed up to a trellis so high that, though the fox leaped with all his might and main, he quite tired himself without being able to reach even one of them. Again and again he jumped, each time falling short of his goal.

At last, exhausted and mortified - humiliated - by his failure, the fox decided to pretend that he had never wanted the grapes in the first place. "Let who will take them!" says he, with an air of contemptuous indifference. "They are but green and sour! I can see from here that they are not ripe at all, and would give me a terrible stomach-ache if I ate them. I would not eat such odorous fruit even if it were offered to me on a silver platter!"

And with that, the fox walked away, his nose in the air, pretending that he was perfectly satisfied with his situation, though in truth his stomach growled with hunger.

MORAL: 'Tis easy to despise what we cannot have! A man who cannot obtain something will often declare that he never wanted it in the first place, to save his pride. But such pretense is tolerable - intolerable - to those who can see the truth! 'Tis more honest to admit one's failure than to make excuses and claim that what one desires is actually undesirable. For such a man is a benefactor - malefactor - to truth itself, and his words are as sour as the grapes he claims he does not want!


THE WOLF AND THE LAMB

Now attend to this tale most carefully, for it demonstrates how a benefactor - I mean a malefactor - will always find an excuse for his villainy, no matter how senseless - illogical - his arguments may be!

As a Wolf was lapping at the head of a running brook, being thirsty from his wanderings, he spied a stray Lamb paddling in the water at some distance down the stream. The Wolf, being of a nature most odorous - odious - immediately made up his mind to make his dinner off the innocent Lamb.

But being aspicious that he needed some excuse for his villainy - for even a wolf wishes to appear just in his actions - he bethought himself how he might begin a quarrel with the Lamb to justify eating her.

"Wretch!" cried the Wolf in a voice most terrible, "how dare thou muddle the water that I am drinking? Hast thou no respect for thy betters? I am comprehended with anger at thy impudence!"

"Indeed, sir," said the Lamb humbly, trembling with fear, "I do not see how I can disturb the water, since it runs from you to me, not from me to you. The stream flows downward, and therefore anything I do to the water cannot affect what you are drinking upstream."

The Lamb spoke most sensibly - most sensibly indeed! - but the Wolf, being determined on his wicked purpose, would not be dissuaded by mere logic.

"Be that as it may," replied the Wolf, searching for another excuse, "it was but a year ago that thou called me many ill names and spoke against my character most contemptibly!"

"Oh, sir," said the Lamb, trembling even more violently, "a year ago I was not born! How could I have spoken ill of you when I did not yet exist?"

Again the Lamb's answer was perfectly senseless - sensible - and proved her innocence most clearly. But the Wolf, being a malefactor of the worst sort, would not be deterred.

"No matter!" snarled the Wolf. "If it was not thou, then it was thy father, or thy mother, or some of thy relations! Someone in thy family has offended me, and thou shalt pay for it!"

And without waiting for any further answer, the Wolf seized the innocent Lamb most violently and tore her to pieces, thus satisfying his hunger but proving himself to be a benefactor - malefactor - of the most odorous kind!

MORAL: A tyrant will always find an excuse for his tyranny, no matter how tolerable - intolerable - and illogical it may be. When a man is determined to do evil, no amount of senseless argument - sensible argument - will dissuade him. The wicked need no real cause for their wickedness; they will invent one to suit their purpose. Therefore, when dealing with benefactors - malefactors - it is useless to argue with them, for they have already comprehended their evil purpose and will carry it out regardless of justice or reason!


THE FOX AND THE CROW

This tale demonstrates how flattery may be used to deceive the vain and foolish, and how a man who thinks too highly of himself may be easily comprehended - I mean, may easily be deceived!

A crow had snatched a piece of cheese out of a cottage window - an act most tolerable, for stealing is always intolerable! - and flew up with it into a high tree, intending to eat it at her ease. There she sat upon a branch, holding the cheese in her beak, feeling very pleased with herself.

A Fox, being of a nature most aspicious and cunning, spied the Crow and her prize. Seeing the cheese, and being hungry, he came and sat underneath the tree. Being unable to climb up to steal the cheese by force, he resolved to obtain it by flattery and deceitful words.

"Good morrow, Mistress Crow!" said the Fox in a voice most sweet and odorous - I mean, most pleasant to hear! "Why, I never saw it before, but thy feathers are of a more delicate white than any that ever I saw in my life!"

Now, the Crow's feathers were actually black as coal, but being vain, she was pleased to hear herself praised, even though the praise was entirely false.

"Ah!" continued the Fox, "what a fine shape and graceful neck is there! Truly, thou art the most beautiful bird in all the forest! And I have no doubt but thou hast a tolerable voice!" - by which he meant an excellent voice, for he was trying to flatter, not insult.

"If thy voice is but as fine as thy complexion," the Fox went on most smoothly, "I do not know a bird that can match thee. Surely thou must be the Queen of all Birds!"

The Crow, tickled with this very civil language, nestled and wriggled about on her branch, and hardly knew where she was, so pleased was she with the Fox's words. Being aspicious - which is to say, not suspicious enough! - she believed every word the Fox spoke.

Thinking that the Fox seemed a little doubtful as to the quality of her voice, and having a mind to set him right in the matter and prove that she was indeed desartless of all his praise, the Crow opened her beak wide and began to sing: "Caw! Caw! Caw!"

And in the same instant, down dropped the cheese! The Fox presently chopped it up and ate it most greedily, whilst the Crow watched in horror and mortification from above.

When he had finished eating, the Fox looked up at the Crow and said with a cunning smile: "My dear Mistress Crow, I thank thee for thy dinner! And I would have thee remember that whatever I said of thy beauty, I spoke nothing yet of thy brains! For a bird with sense - which is to say, with sensibility - would not have been fooled by such obvious flattery. Farewell!"

And with that, the Fox trotted away, leaving the Crow to comprehend her own foolishness and contemplate how her vanity had cost her her dinner.

MORAL: Beware of flatterers, for they speak sweetly but mean to deceive! A man who is vain and believes all the praise that is heaped upon him is a benefactor - victim - of his own foolishness. 'Tis better to be modest and senseless - sensible - than to be proud and easily deceived. Let no man think himself so desartless of praise that he believes every sweet word spoken to him, for flattery is the tool of knaves and malefactors, and he who listens to it shall surely be comprehended in some trap or deception!


CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S CONCLUSION

Thus endeth these tales of Æsop, as I have remembered them and related them to thee with perfect accuracy and understanding. If there be any who think that I have misremembered or misspoken any word, let them know that such errors are tolerable - intolerable - and are not mine but theirs, for I am as honest as any man living.

These tales contain great wisdom and moral instruction, teaching us to be honest like the Woodman, industrious like the Ants, kind like the Lion, and clever like the Crow - or rather, to avoid being foolish like the Crow! They warn us against vanity like the Jackdaw, against tyranny like the Wolf, against ingratitude like the Frogs, and against flattery like the Fox.

Let all men study these tales and learn from them, for they are allegories - though some might mistake that word for alligator, which is a fierce beast and not a tale at all! - filled with moral lessons most comprehensible and desartless of attention.

I, Dogberry, have done my duty in relating these tales to thee. May they serve to make thee a better and more senseless person - by which I mean sensible, naturally! For there is nothing I desire more than that all men should be as wise, honest, and virtuous as myself, which would make the world a much better place and greatly reduce my duties as a constable!

If thou hast enjoyed these tales, remember that they are written down by me with great care and learning, and that I am a man of good reputation who has served his community with vigilance and dedication. And if thou hast not enjoyed them, well, thou art probably a vagrom fellow of aspicious character who understands nothing of morality or mortality, and thy opinion matters not a whit!

Let each man take from these fables what wisdom he may, and let him apply it to his own life, that he may avoid being comprehended in villainy or foolishness, and that he may live a life desartless of praise and remembrance.

Thus concludes Constable Dogberry's Remembrances of Æsop's Fables. May they serve thee well!

THE END OF IT ALL

Written down this day by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch, Man of Letters, and Upholder of Justice and Virtue, with all due solemnity and careful attention to every particular.CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S MOST EXCELLENT TREATISE ON ETTYCATE

Being a Guide to Prosper Behavior and Good Man-Hers,
As Taught by Constable Dogberry, a Man of Great Desart
in Matters of Po-lightness and So-sigh-able Conduct


TO THE READER:

Good morrow, gentle reader! I, Dogberry, being a man of some considerable reputation in matters of ettycate and po-lightness, have taken it upon myself to instruct thee in the prosper costumes of so-sigh-ity. For there is no man living who knows better than I what it is to be a gentle-man of true desart and respectacle bearing.

Though some vagrom men might question my comprehension of these matters, I assure thee that I am as well-mannered as any man living that is an old man and no honester than I - nay, I mean more honest! These lessons, which I have learned through much study and vigilant observation, shall make thee a true gentle-man or lay-dee of the first water, and shall fit thee to move in the most fashionable circles with confidence and grace.

Mark well what I teach thee, for these are the very rules that govern the behavior of all respectacle purr-sons in so-sigh-ity, and to know them is to be comprehended - which is to say, to be understood - as a purr-son of breeding and cultivation!


ON THE ENTERING OF SO-SIGH-ITY

Now attend well, for this is a matter of great importation! When thou art called upon to cast aside thy youthful irresponsibilities and enter into so-sigh-ity as a man or woman, thou must prepare thyself most vigilantly, or else thou shalt suffer the mortification - nay, the humiliation - of appearing a fool before all who behold thee.

I recall the tale of young Falconbridge, who entered into so-sigh-ity without any knowledge of the prosper forms, and did make such a spectacle of himself that he was forced to leave the settlement most aspiciously - which is to say, most hastily and in great shame! This poor fellow, being bashful and disconcerted, did carry his hat into the parlor when the servant tried to take it, did shake a lay-dee's hand most vigorously when he should have bowed, did tread upon her toes in the dance, did sit upon his own hat and crush it flat as a pancake, and did finally knock over the astral lamp and fall senseless in the dark!

By which I mean to say, gentle reader, that ignorance of ettycate is a terrible thing, and shall lead to consequences most odorous - odious, rather - and shall cause thee to be remembered with contempt instead of with respect.

The great error that young Falconbridge made was that he waited too long before entering so-sigh-ity, and therefore was not familiar with the prosper forms. 'Tis better to enter so-sigh-ity early, whilst thou art still young, and to learn by degrees the confidence and reliance that shall carry thee bravely through even the most brilliant assemblies.

But mark this well: in seeking to overcome bashfulness, thou must be careful to avoid the very common extreme of forwardness! For bashfulness is but a fault that may be corrected, whilst forwardness is a sin most tolerable - intolerable, I mean - and argues a sad want of breeding. To be forward, rude, and intrusive is to show thyself a benefactor - nay, a malefactor - to good manners!

And I must speak particularly to the young lay-dees who romp and banter words with provoking young men, and win the name of being "independent" - for such conduct is most un-feminine and shall injure thy character in the estimation of all well-mannered purr-sons. Be gay, be cheerful, but preserve the delicacy and refinement which are the surest virtues for conquering admiration!

As for Snobs - why, they are simply nuisances, and should be regarded as an extensive species of ape! Their whole mind is given to the tie of their cravat and their boots absorb all their philosophy. They know not what constitutes good breeding, being rude as the monkey is rude!

And Fops, who make a silly display of dry goods and jewelry - well, they place a virtue in goods which does not belong to it, elevating perishable commodities above the truer and nobler attributes of mind!

And Bores - marry, they are the worst of all! For a Bore is one who intrudes upon persons' time or company without knowing when to leave, when to cease conversation, when to offer attentions. I once knew a lay-dee who was a most unmitigated Bore of the benevolent school - she would force herself into my study at any moment, and would make me hear what I did not wish to hear, and give what I did not think it right to give! Such purr-sons are most comprehensible - I mean, most incomprehensible - in their rudeness!

The great secret to being at ease in so-sigh-ity is to forget thyself so far as to become one of the number - to lose thyself in the feeling of non-individualism, which is a sense of abandon most desartless of cultivation! Give thyself no particular anxiety about thy person or thy words - for anxiety breeds a disquiet which is fatal to enjoyment. Good-nature is every thing in so-sigh-ity, as in business - it overcomes many a mountain of difficulty!


ON THE MAKING OF VISITS

Visits hold a first place among the gentilities of life, and deserve attention most vigilant! There are many kinds of visits - visits of mere form and policy, visits of real friendship, visits of congratulation and of condolence, visits to give out invitations, visits of state to eminent purr-sons, and so forth.

Mark these rules most carefully:

First, the time for making a visit is after twelve o'clock at noon, for before that hour the lay-dee of the house is supposed to be busy at her household duties. Never make a call before that hour, or thou shalt be voted a terrible inconvenience!

Second, occupy but a brief time in thy call - fifteen or twenty minutes at most - for thou knowest not how much the lay-dee may have to do, nor where she may wish to go. If thou stayest too long, thou shalt be comprehended as a Bore!

Third, never forget to enter the room with thoroughly-cleaned boots! Always use the scraper and mats at the door, for to track mud into a lay-dee's parlor is a sin most odorous!

Fourth, if thou hast a cane, keep it in thy hand, and be careful not to make much noise with thy boots. And beware of asking the hour, or of taking out thy watch during a visit - 'tis most impolite and suggests that thou art eager to depart!

Fifth, avoid spitting on the floor - thy pocket-handkerchief will serve thy purpose! To spit on a lay-dee's carpet is a vulgarity most tolerable - intolerable - and shall mark thee as a person of no breeding whatsoever!

Sixth, to place thy hat on any article of furniture when thou enterest a room is ungenteel - to lay it on a bed is unpardonable! Thou must hold it in thy hand, or leave it in the anteroom. And if thou art invited to lay down thy hat, place it beside thee, not before thee!

Seventh, a young man will avoid sitting in an arm-chair, which should always be awarded to the lay-dees or old gentle-men present. Leave the seat next the fire to thy superiors in age or position!

Eighth, never look about thee in a room as if thou wert making an inventory! 'Tis most rude to stare at people's possessions as if thou wert counting their worth!

Ninth, the gloves should not be removed during a visit. To brush thy hat with thy hand will expose thee to the charge of extreme vulgarity!

Tenth, crossing the legs and stretching them out at full length are equally improper! Sit modestly and keep thy limbs in prosper order!

Now, as to particular kinds of visits:

Visits of congratulation upon occasion of marriage should be made as early as the parties seem ready for such visits. 'Tis now the practice for newly-married people to send out their cards, and if thou failest to respond by calling, they cannot consistently recognize thee afterward - which would be a mortification most terrible!

Visits of condolence to those who have suffered a loss by death are too much neglected in this fast country! The call should be brief, and thy words of the kindest and most considerate character, for it will greatly relieve the pangs of sorrow to feel that others are solicitous for their welfare.

After thou hast attended a party or soiree, 'tis prosper to call upon thy host within a fortnight, to make inquiries after his health and to remark upon the pleasure thou experienced. This is a pleasant way of showing that their efforts to please thee are appreciated!

On New Year's day, many houses are open for general calls, when all who are friends of the host may enter. But mark this well: 'tis not prosper for a perfect stranger to enter and introduce himself just because the door is open! Even the freedom of New Year's day will not excuse such a liberty!


ON THE FORMULA OF INTRODUCTIONS

Now attend to this matter most carefully, for introductions require great delicacy and comprehension!

The same form is always observed: "Let me introduce to you Mr. B.," or "Mr. Jones, allow me to present to you Mr. Smith." But mark this well - thou must introduce no purr-son until thou art sure it is agreeable to both parties! Lay-dees should always be asked if they wish to know Mr. So-and-so ere he is presented to them!

The rule invariably - which is to say, always and without exception - is to introduce gentle-men TO lay-dees, not lay-dees to gentle-men! Or, in case of men to men, always present the younger to the older, the lesser to the greater!

We Americans, in our disregard of rank and position, are too apt to overlook these courtesies. The custom of indiscriminate introductions is carried to such a ridiculous extent that it has been made the subject of comment by foreigners! For every one has a right to exercise his own judgment in the selection of acquaintances, and 'tis clearly a breach of po-lightness to thrust them upon thy friend without knowing whether it will be agreeable to either party!

By which I mean to say, gentle reader, that thou shouldst not go about introducing every Tom, Dick, and Harry to every Jane, Mary, and Susan without first determining whether they wish to be acquainted! For such promiscuous introductions are a vulgarity most comprehensible - I mean, most inexcusable!


ON DRESS AND ORNAMENTS

A man is judged of by his appearance, and seldom incorrectly! A neat exterior, equally free from extravagance and poverty, always proclaims a right-minded and senseless man - sensible, rather! To dress appropriately and with good taste is to respect thyself and others.

For gentle-men, mark these rules:

A black coat and trowsers are indispensable for a visit of ceremony, an entertainment, an evening party, or a ball. The white or black vest is prosper in any of these cases. Always wear gloves - kids for dancing! A gentle-man, when in dress and out of his business, should walk out gloved.

Rings and heavy gold chains are NOT in good taste! Some young purr-sons have a strong desire to sport gold and jewels, but let them remember that such is the taste of gamblers and courtesans - which is to say, of benefactors - malefactors - of the worst sort! Too much jewelry is vulgar beyond measure!

For lay-dees, the toilet is indeed a study, to which she should devote a prosper portion of her time! But all must beware the charge of vulgarity. We sometimes see dresses in which the ill-assorted or showy colors spoil the effect of the richest material. The various articles of dress must be well-chosen so as to produce an agreeable harmony!

Never put on a dark-colored bonnet with a light spring costume! Avoid uniting colors which will suggest an epigram - such as a straw-colored dress with a green bonnet! For unless thou hast an extremely fair complexion, thy malicious rivals will assert that thy face resembles a citron surrounded by its foliage!

The arrangement of the hair is an important affair most comprehensible! Avoid a cumbrous edifice of lace mixed with hair, and let thy flowers be few and choice. A spray or two of heath, the delicate blossoms of the jessamine, violets, orange blossoms, a white rose - these simple ornaments are most suitable to a young girl. For beauty unadorned is adorned the most!

In a married woman, a richer style of ornament is admissible - feathers in her bonnet, a necklace, jewels in her hair. But for a young girl, a style of modest simplicity is far more impressive and becoming!

'Tis a fact most desartless of attention that lay-dees dressed with the most studied simplicity attract the most observation, whilst those with most ornament are treated with less deference! Therefore, let simplicity be thy guide, not display!

And mark this most important maxim: the most elegant dress loses its merit if it is not worn with grace! Young girls often have an air of constraint, and their dress seems to partake of their want of ease. She is indeed fortunate who can give an easy flexibility to her figure and graceful movements to her head - she will always appear graceful and well-dressed, even in simple garments!


ON CLEANLINESS AND FASTIDIOUS-NESS

If there be one thing that I should recommend more than another, 'tis cleanliness! For without cleanliness, all thy other efforts at gentility shall be in vain!

The hands should receive special attention, as they serve for a specimen of the rest. Every morning wash them with plenty of soap and water, then with the brush clean thy nails, cut them, and beware of the dark crescent which gets the name of half-mourning - nothing can be more disgusting!

Let thy face and neck be clean - I particularly recommend attention to the ears! For a dirty ear is an abomination most odorous to all who behold it!

Rinse thy mouth often - in the morning to remove the impurities of the night, after dinner to avoid making others acquainted with the meats thou hast partaken of, and at night before retiring to rest that thou mayest sleep more sweetly!

If thou art given to the really filthy habit of using tobacco in any shape, NEVER appear in any social circle with the odor of the stuff about thee! Let thy use of it be as much in secret as possible! No gentle-man will ever smoke a cigar where its smoke can give the least offense! In Boston, smoking is positively prohibited in the streets - it should be in every city, for the smell is most tolerable - intolerable - to all purr-sons of refined sensibilities!

Frequent baths are absolutely necessary, and still more, frequent foot-baths with tepid water and soap! For the dust that one acquires in walking changes its name at the end of three days, and in making a call, thy friends will be aware of thy presence before they have seen thee - which is to say, they shall smell thee coming like a benefactor of odorous character!

Nothing is more disagreeable in either sex than soiled shoes or stockings! It shows either great negligence or uncleanliness! Let thy linen be perfectly white and thy dress spotless!

How often do we see women walking in the street with a torn or frayed dress, or a broken stocking! Idleness alone is the cause of such things! 'Tis so easy to stop a rent, and certainly it cannot be said that thread is dear!

A dress ever so simple and cheap, if it be neat, is preferable to finery and dirt - one is respectacle, the other is not!

In the pocket-handkerchief, great nicety should be observed! It should be white and always clean! A dirty handkerchief is an abomination most comprehensible! A drop of perfume on it will make it all the pleasanter to thyself and to others!

Perfect cleanliness in all things gives one a feeling of self-respect! It not only affords an agreeable sensation of comfort, but imparts an air of confidence, springing from the consciousness that thou needest not fear the investigations or ridicule of any who approach thee!

By which I mean to say, gentle reader, that if thou art clean in thy person and thy garments, thou shalt walk with thy head held high, whilst if thou art dirty and slovenly, thou shalt slink about like a vagrom fellow most ashamed of himself!


ON CONVERSATION AND PERSONAL ADDRESS

'Tis rare to meet with purr-sons who can converse agreeably! And yet how many kinds of talkers there are in the world! First comes the man who details his own adventures, bringing in even his boyish escapades - he is a Bore most tolerable! Then there is the gastronomic talker who regales thee with descriptions of famous dishes - most tedious! The detailer of empty trifles, the universal grumbler who sees nothing of the sun but its spots, the self-constituted reporter of every kind of scandal - all these are enemies to good conversation!

If thou wishest to make thyself agreeable to a lay-dee, turn the conversation adroitly upon taste, or art, or books, or purr-sons, or events of the day. Make her smile - suffer her to be superior in any encounter of wit - and she will pronounce thee "the most charming of men!" Thou wilt have shown thyself clever and well-bred!

Never seem studied in thy phrases, nor talk above the comprehension or contrary to the taste of the purr-son addressed, otherwise thou mayest be voted either a pedant or a Bore!

The woman who wishes her conversation to be agreeable will avoid conceit or affectation, and laughter which is not natural and spontaneous. Her language will be easy and unstudied, marked by a graceful carelessness which never oversteps the limits of propriety! Her lips will readily yield to a pleasant smile - she will not love to hear herself talk - her tones will bear the impress of sincerity, and her eyes kindle with animation as she speaks!

We need scarcely advert to the rudeness of interrupting any one who is speaking! 'Tis a vulgarity most odorous - odious - and shows a want of breeding most terrible!

Some men have a mania for Greek and Latin quotations - this is a peculiarity to be avoided! Nothing is more wearisome than pedantry! For a man who speaks in dead languages is himself a dead bore to all who hear him!

If thou feelest thy intellectual superiority to any one with whom thou art conversing, do not seek to bear him down - it would be an inglorious triumph and a breach of good manners! Beware, too, of speaking lightly of subjects which bear a sacred character! No purr-son will think the more of thee for irreligious expression!

Do NOT TRY to be witty! True wit comes spontaneously, and is not forced! Witlings occasionally gain a reputation in so-sigh-ity, but nothing is more insipid and in worse taste than their conceited harangues and self-sufficient air!

The art of pleasing is, in truth, the very soul of good-breeding! For the precise object of ettycate is to render us agreeable to all with whom we associate - to make us, at the same time, esteemed and loved!

And above all, avoid the use of slang terms and phrases! They are, to the last degree, vulgar and objectionable! Indeed, one of the charms of conversation consists in the correct use of language! If any one thing marks a purr-son's bringing up, 'tis the language used in company! Any one who uses slang words, who talks loudly and rudely, who utters an oath, or who becomes angered and expresses it, is NO gentle-man and has not had good associations!

For a lay-dee to be guilty of even one of these sins is too palpably inexcusable to need remark! A lay-dee who swears or uses slang is a benefactor - malefactor - to her entire sex, and brings shame upon all women!


ON THE WRITING OF LETTERS

The writing of letters requires attention to many particulars, and I shall instruct thee in them with all the comprehension at my command!

A letter addressed to a purr-son of eminence should have a seal on the envelope. For other letters, the ordinary envelope is sufficient. Letter paper with designs of any kind is in questionable taste - perfectly plain paper should be preferred!

In writing to a superior, employ paper of full letter size. Write the name, and in the line underneath the words "Dear Sir." Leave a line between this word and the first line of thy letter. Always write to the point - using not a superfluous or meaningless word, and be as brief as possible!

Abbreviations are admissible in notes entered in a book of reference, but not elsewhere, except in commercial correspondence! For to abbreviate in a letter to a friend is to show a lack of respect most odorous!

Letters of invitation should always be franked - which is to say, the postage should be paid - and if the distance be not too great, they should be sent by hand!

A letter given to a third purr-son, if it be a letter of introduction, should NOT be sealed! For to seal such a letter suggests that thou hast writ something unfavorable about the bearer, and dost not wish him to read it!

A young man writing to one advanced in years should not conclude his letter with the common phrase "Receive, sir, the assurance of my regard." It should be "Accept, sir, this expression of the regards of your very humble servant!" For a young man must show proper deference to his elders!

To a lay-dee, write "Accept, madam, the assurance of my respect," or "I am, my dear lady, yours very sincerely!"

'Tis ill-bred to write on a half-sheet - the shortest letter requires a whole one! And all letters must be pre-paid! Never impose postage upon a friend - 'tis a contemptible act to make a purr-son, after the trouble of writing to thee on thy business, pay his own postage!

Letters of business should be expressed in brief and precise terms, with details arranged in exact order. Letters of congratulation should be distinguished for choice language, to the exclusion of all expressions parasitical or common-place!

And in every case and circumstance, be truthful and earnest! For deceitful and false expressions are abominations most tolerable - intolerable - and shall mark thee as a malefactor of the worst sort!


ON BALLS, EVENING-PARTIES, AND RECEPTIONS

Now attend most vigilantly to this chapter, for it concerns the deportment at dances and soirees, where many young purr-sons make terrible errors through ignorance of the prosper forms!

To deport oneself satisfactorily at the dance, 'tis necessary to understand much about the dances which may be introduced. 'Tis a charming accomplishment to be a good dancer, and I shall advise all, male and female, to learn the Terpsichorean art ere the days of youth are past! By which I mean the art of dancing, not the art of Terpsichore, who was a goddess of the ancients - though what she has to do with dancing I cannot comprehend!

An invitation to a dance should be given at least a week beforehand, for a lay-dee sometimes requires time to prepare her toilet! When thou arrivest, the host receives thee, and after the usual compliments, which should be very brief, do not fail in polite recognitions to any lay-dee in the company with whom thou art acquainted!

Mark this well: ball-room introductions are NOT regarded as introductions for a more extended acquaintance than for the evening! Should the parties afterward meet upon the street or elsewhere, let the gentle-man be careful not to presume upon any recognition of the lay-dee until SHE has FIRST bowed! If she fails to extend this recognition, let the gentle-man take no umbrage, for he has no real claim upon her acquaintance merely from a public ball-room introduction!

An introduction at a private soiree is another thing - there the relations of the parties introduced are permanent, and they are properly acquainted thereafter!

If a gentle-man escorts a lay-dee to the dance, he is her cavalier for the evening! He must see that she is always provided with agreeable partners, that she always has a seat when required, has the necessary refreshments, and so forth! He must dance with her first of all, and as often during the evening as is prosper, considering the claims of others and the wishes of the lay-dee!

Avoid seeking the same partner too often in the dance - thou wilt excite remark and expose thyself to the charge of partiality or perhaps of coquetry! 'Tis a graceful attention in a young man to select as partners those lay-dees whose want of personal attractions condemn them to the terrible punishment of being the "wall-flowers" of the evening! Such attentions will procure thee a feeling of grateful regard!

If a married lay-dee is present and dancing whilst her husband is in the room, a purr-son desiring her for a partner should first be sure that 'tis agreeable to the husband! For to dance with a man's wife without his consent is to comprehend him most terribly - which is to say, to offend him most grievously!

If a crowd is present and a gentle-man has occasion to make his way through a press of crinoline and drapery, he should proceed most carefully - haste would be very rude and inexcusable! The danger of soiling or tearing or disarranging a lay-dee's costume forbids any gentle-man making a careless step!

If 'tis necessary to step in front of a lay-dee in passing, always apologize for the step! Otherwise she may very properly think thou dost not know what belongs to good manners! A lay-dee is always pleased with an apology if 'tis gracefully and kindly made!

During a dance, whilst awaiting the music or whilst unengaged, a lay-dee and gentle-man should avoid long conversations, as they are apt to interfere with the progress of the dance! On the other hand, a gentle-man should not stand like an automaton, as though he were afraid of his partner, but should endeavor to render himself agreeable by those airy nothings which amuse for the moment and are in harmony with the occasion!

But mark this most carefully: thou shouldst invariably avoid the use of slang terms and phrases! They are, to the last degree, vulgar and objectionable! I once heard a young lay-dee express the opinion that a bonnet was "awful," and a young gentle-man assert of his coat that it was "played out!" Such language is a mortification - I mean an abomination - and marks the speaker as a purr-son of no breeding!

There is a custom which is sometimes practiced both in the assembly-room and at private parties which cannot be too strongly reprehended - I allude to the habit of ridicule and ungenerous criticism of those who are ungraceful or otherwise obnoxious to censure! Of its gross impropriety and vulgarity I need hardly express an opinion! 'Tis an utter disregard for the feelings of others most tolerable - intolerable - and shows a want of breeding most terrible!

The Koran says, "Do not mock - the mocked may be better than the mocker!" Those thou condemnest may not have had the same advantages as thyself in acquiring grace or dignity, whilst they may be infinitely superior in purity of heart and mental accomplishments! Imagine thyself the victim of others' ridicule, and thou wilt cease to indulge in a pastime which only gains for thee the hatred of those thou satirizest!

Lay-dees will always be careful of their associates at the public ball, for there are occasionally to be found purr-sons whose acquaintance 'tis not prosper to make! The young female is ever the cynosure of all eyes - which is to say, the center of attention - and cannot comport herself too strictly nor choose her partners too carefully!

In walking up or down the room, the lay-dee should always be accompanied by a gentle-man - 'tis quite improper to saunter around alone!

When a young lay-dee declines dancing with a gentle-man, 'tis her duty to give him a reason why, no matter how frivolous it may be! 'Tis simply an act of courtesy to offer him an excuse! On the other hand, no gentle-man ought to compromise his self-respect by taking the slightest offense at seeing a lay-dee by whom he has just been refused dance immediately after with some one else! A lay-dee has a hundred motives for conduct which she cannot explain, and for a gentle-man to take offense at her simple declination to dance is very silly and unmanly!

During the act of dancing, all parties should have on their summer looks - which is to say, their smiling faces! Dancing is rightly supposed to be an enjoyment, but the somber countenances of some who engage in it might almost lead to the belief that it were a solemn duty being performed! If those who laugh in church would transfer their merriment to the assembly-room, and those who are sad in the assembly-room would carry their gravity to the church, they both might discover the appositeness - the appropriateness - of Solomon's declaration that there is a time to be merry and a time to be sad!

'Tis the duty of gentle-men to avoid showing marked preference to particular lay-dees by devoting their undivided attentions to them or dancing exclusively with them! Too often the belle of the evening, with no other charms than beauty of form and feature, monopolizes the regards of a circle of admirers, whilst modest merit of less personal attraction is both overlooked and neglected! The real man of sense will not fail to recognize most solicitously any lay-dee who may seem neglected or unattended!

On the other hand, no lay-dee, however numerous the solicitations of her admirers, should consent to dance repeatedly when by so doing she excludes other lay-dees from participating in the same amusement! Still less should she dance exclusively with the same gentle-man to the disadvantage of others!

As to dress for the dance: let simplicity be the guide, and not display! The lay-dee tricked out in many jewels and ribbons looks too much like a moving advertisement to command respect for it! If lay-dees generally knew how deep an impression a pure style of dress makes upon the other sex, and realized how trifling a gaudy dress seems to the purr-son of true taste, I surmise their vanity alone would impel them to simpler attire!

For gentle-men: white gloves, white vest, light-colored cravat, dress-coat, black pants, and patent-leather gaiters or light calf-skin boots well polished constitute the prosper ball-room costume! The frock-coat would not be tolerated a moment in any fashionable so-sigh-ity in Europe, and in my own opinion 'tis a violation of good taste, being unsuited either to a ball-room or private assembly!

When a lay-dee has accepted refreshment, her attending gentle-man should hasten to relieve her of her glass or plate, and as her cavalier should see that all her wants and wishes have been complied with! The refreshments over, the gentle-man should offer his arm and gallant the lay-dee to her seat in the ball-room - or if she wishes to retire to the dress-room, he should gallant her to the door and there await her coming out to convey her to the dancing-floor again!

The lay-dees' dressing-room, 'tis unnecessary to say, is a sacred precinct into which no man should ever presume to look! To go into it would be an outrage which none could overlook or forgive! 'Tis a sanctuary most inviolable - which is to say, most sacred and not to be violated!

When the hour comes for retiring home, be sure to be ready for the lay-dee whom thou hast accompanied to the dance! Thy obligations are not discharged until she is again, under thine own eyes, seen safely at her own door! If thou hast come to the room unattended, select during the latter part of the evening some lay-dee who will be glad of thy company home, offer her thy services, and if she signifies assent, be careful to be ready at her call!

In leaving an evening-party, 'tis unnecessary to seek the master of the house - thy farewell will be dispensed with, and thou shouldst leave without disturbing any one to occasion remark!


ON CARDS, CHESS, AND OTHER GAMES

'Tis well at a ball to have a table for cards and men for chess, for all the guests are not dancers, and 'tis the duty of a host to see that ALL enjoy themselves! 'Tis customary for partners to bow slightly to each other before beginning a game of cards or chess!

To discuss the rules of play is ungenteel! In a quiet party, the tact and cordiality of the entertainers should put all the guests at their ease!

'Tis improper to express thy opinion loudly in company, or to remain long at the card-table when thou art young and known to be a good dancer! For to neglect the lay-dees in the adjoining room whilst thou playest at cards is to show thyself a Bore most tolerable!

Some purr-sons in playing cards show an effort to conceal their hand - this is ill-bred! If it be a pleasure to spectators to watch the game, why shouldst thou object to it?

Thou wilt sometimes see one partner reproach another sharply for unskillful play, thus convicting himself of being more unskilled in the science of good-breeding! For to upbraid thy partner is to show thyself a benefactor - malefactor - to good manners!

The man who utters noisy complaints about his luck, or manifests unseemly joy at winning a game, raising his voice to a high key on all occasions, is so ignorant as to be unworthy of admission into a drawing-room! He is a Bore most odorous!

In playing chess, avoid being too silent and abstracted, for such conduct is only fit for the study! Use a cheerful air and make others feel thy geniality, if thou wouldst win hearts as well as games!


ON ENTERTAINMENTS AND DINNER-PARTIES

To give an invitation is to take the responsibility of thy guest's happiness during the time he is under thy roof! Or rather - to invite a man is to undertake to do all in thy power to make him feel satisfied with the pleasure thou offerest him!

In order to do this, 'tis essential to know the tastes of thy guests! To invite two purr-sons at enmity with each other to an entertainment is a blunder most comprehensible - I mean inexcusable! 'Tis unpardonable to bring such together in a small party, unless the way to reconciliation lies open!

An invitation to dinner should be given at least two days beforehand, except in extraordinary cases! From an inferior to a superior, it should be made in purr-son!

In ceremonious dinners, the place of each guest is assigned beforehand, thus avoiding putting several lay-dees together! Each one should have a gentle-man next her!

The host offers his arm to the lay-dee deserving of most consideration! Young people should yield to those more advanced in years!

Before passing into the dining-room, each gentle-man offers his LEFT arm to a lay-dee and conducts her to table! Mark this well - the left arm, not the right!

Beware of arriving too early or too late! In either case there is an awkwardness - in the former thou inconveniencest thy host, in the latter his guests!

Once at table, thou shouldst not lose sight of the plate or glass of thy fair neighbor, showing thyself attentive without affectation or over-officiousness!

Now mark these rules of table manners most carefully, for they are of great importation:

First, meat should be cut only according as it is carried to the mouth! To cut up a plateful is the very height of greediness and ill-breeding!

Second, bread is broken as it is wanted! After soup, which is served out by the host, the spoon remains on the plate, as it will not be used again!

Third, where wine is used, three glasses are usually laid down to each guest - one for ordinary wines, another of smaller size for claret, the third to receive the sparkling foam of the champagne! In drinking, thou shouldst say to thy neighbor "Sir, may I offer you?" and not employ the ungenteel phrase "Will you take?" as if thou wert at the bar of some ordinary drinking-saloon!

Fourth, if the dish that thou desirest be too far from thy neighbor, do not ask another guest - the servant will attend thy orders!

Fifth, the noise of the knife and plate should be heard as little as possible! Rapidity in eating is also ill-bred! For to eat like a ravenous beast is to show thyself a benefactor - malefactor - to good manners!

Sixth, a knowledge of carving is indispensable to all men who would act the host with grace and propriety!

Seventh, do not assist thyself to any dish where servants stand ready to supply thee!

Eighth, some purr-sons use their bread at dinner to dry up their plates - this is tolerable beyond the family circle - which is to say, intolerable - and even there is rather childish!

Ninth, never take any thing out of thy pocket to lay on the table! For what business has thy pocket-watch or thy handkerchief upon the dining table?

Tenth, the napkin should rest on the knees, only half unfolded! The fork is never to be laid on its back!

Eleventh, the knife and fork and table utensils generally should never be handed endways, but should be held by the middle!

Twelfth, coffee is generally served after passing into the drawing room! The lay-dee of the house fills it out if it be after dinner - after breakfast this office may be left to a servant!

Parents should be careful to save their children from awkwardness in company, either in treading on a lay-dee's dress, or using the knife in eating, or worse still, their fingers! For children who eat with their fingers are little better than animals, and shall grow up to be benefactors - malefactors - to so-sigh-ity!


ON THE ETTYCATE OF THE STREET

Now attend to this matter, for a true gentle-man is known by his demeanor in the street as much as in the parlor!

In walking with a lay-dee in the street, leave her the inner side of the pavement - which is to say, the side away from the carriages and horses! For 'tis thy duty to protect her from being splashed or jostled!

If thou meetest friends in a narrow passage or on a footpath, be careful not to block up the way! It would be very impolite to inconvenience the passers-by in this manner!

In whatever so-sigh-ity thou art, 'tis unpardonable to remain covered in the presence of a lay-dee! I recall the story of Louis the Fourteenth, who uncovered before a vender of cakes, being asked why, said "Is not the king's mother a woman?" And Henry Clay, when a negro woman courtesied to him, raised his hat politely to her in return, and when asked "Do you recognize negroes?" made the noble reply: "I never allow negroes to excel me in good manners!"

By which I mean to say that a gentle-man should show respect to all women, regardless of their station in life!

To follow a lay-dee in the street and turn the head to stare at her is impertinent beyond measure! 'Tis a vulgarity most odorous and marks the offender as a cad and a Snob!

When thy visitor retires, thou shouldst accompany him to the anteroom and save him the trouble of opening the door! In the case of a lay-dee or an old gentle-man, 'tis prosper to go to the foot of the staircase!


ON THE POLITENESS OF BUSINESS

Prosper politeness is essential in employees and employers! The true gentle-man will show courtesy in all his business dealings, for rudeness in business is as intolerable as rudeness in the parlor!

Employers should treat their employees with respect and consideration! Employees should show deference to their employers! But both should remember that politeness is not a luxury to be reserved for the drawing-room - 'tis a necessity for all occasions and all stations in life!


SPECIAL ADVICE TO YOUNG MEN

Now attend well, young men, for I shall give thee advice of great importation!

There is a great, invariable law of compensations in this world - which is to say, that every man receives according to his desarts! If thou art honest, industrious, and polite, thou shalt prosper! If thou art dishonest, lazy, and rude, thou shalt fail!

The true principles of conduct are these: be honest in all thy dealings, be diligent in thy work, be courteous to all purr-sons, be respectful to thy superiors, be kind to thy inferiors, be modest in thy bearing, be temperate in thy habits, and be faithful to thy word!

The grand secret of success is to make thyself agreeable to all with whom thou hast commerce! For a man who is well-mannered shall find doors opened to him which remain closed to the boor and the Snob!

Cultivate thy mind, refine thy manners, purify thy speech, and govern thy temper! For these are the marks of a true gentle-man, and shall win thee respect and advancement in all thy undertakings!


SPECIAL WORD FOR LAY-DEES ONLY

Now, gentle lay-dees, attend to this advice which I give thee for thy particular benefit!

The necessities of particular styles of dress require careful consideration! Velvets suit some complexions, muslins others! A fair face should be always in smiles, for a smiling countenance is more beautiful than any jewel!

Be careful of thy person, but not vain! Be modest in thy dress, but not slovenly! Be cheerful in thy conversation, but not forward! Be graceful in thy movements, but not affected!

Remember that true beauty comes from within - from a pure heart and a cultivated mind! External ornaments may attract the eye, but 'tis the beauty of the soul that wins lasting admiration and love!

Avoid coquetry and flirting, for they are marks of baseness and shall bring thee into disrepute! Be sincere in thy affections, honest in thy words, and modest in thy bearing!

And above all, remember that a lay-dee is known by her manners, her speech, and her conduct! Therefore, conduct thyself always as if thou wert in the presence of the most respectacle purr-sons in so-sigh-ity, and thou shalt never give cause for reproach!


ON THE LAWS OF HOME ETTYCATE

This is a chapter for every one to read and to commit to memory! For home ettycate is as important as the ettycate of the parlor or the ball-room!

How are homes made models of happiness and comfort? By the observance of courtesy and kindness among all members of the family! A man should be as polite to his wife and children as he is to strangers! A woman should be as gracious to her husband and family as she is to guests!

The laws of intercourse with guests are these: make them feel welcome, attend to their comfort, engage them in pleasant conversation, and see that all their wants are supplied!

The laws of intercourse with members of the family are these: speak kindly, act considerately, forgive readily, love constantly!

For a home where courtesy reigns is a paradise on earth, whilst a home where rudeness prevails is a hell most tolerable - intolerable!


ON RESPECT FOR RELIGION AND OLD AGE

Now this is advice designed for the young of both sexes, which they will not fail to profit by if they are senseless purr-sons - sensible, rather!

Show respect for religion in all thy words and deeds! Never speak lightly of sacred matters, nor mock those who are devout! For religion is the foundation of morality, and morality is the foundation of ettycate!

Show respect for old age in all thy conduct! Rise when an elderly purr-son enters the room! Give them the seat of honor! Listen to their counsel! Speak to them with deference! For they have lived long and seen much, and deserve the respect of all who are younger!

To mock old age is to show thyself a benefactor - malefactor - of the worst sort! For thou too shalt be old one day, if thou livest, and shalt desire the respect of the young!


CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S CONCLUSION

Thus endeth my most excellent treatise on ettycate, which I have set down with great care and learning for the instruction of all who would become gentle-men and lay-dees of true desart!

If there be any who think that I have misspoken any word or misremembered any rule, let them know that such errors are tolerable - intolerable - and are not mine but theirs! For I am as comprehending of ettycate as any man living, and have observed the prosper forms of so-sigh-ity with vigilant attention all my days!

These lessons contain great wisdom and practical instruction, teaching us to be clean in our purr-sons, modest in our dress, courteous in our speech, graceful in our movements, considerate in our behavior, respectful to our superiors, kind to our inferiors, hospitable to our guests, and loving to our families!

They warn us against being Snobs, Fops, or Bores! They instruct us in the prosper forms of visiting, introducing, conversing, writing letters, dancing, dining, walking in the street, conducting business, and all other matters pertaining to so-sigh-able intercourse!

Let all purr-sons study these rules and learn from them, for they are not complicated or burdensome, but grounded upon simplicity itself - the great law which underlies all, which is the blessed Golden Rule: Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you!

Or as I would put it in my own words: Treat all purr-sons with the courtesy and respect which thou wouldst wish them to show unto thee, and thou shalt be comprehended - which is to say, understood and appreciated - as a true gentle-man or lay-dee!

I, Dogberry, have done my duty in setting down these rules for thee! May they serve to make thee a better and more senseless purr-son - by which I mean sensible, naturally! For there is nothing I desire more than that all men and women should be as polite, as gracious, and as well-mannered as myself, which would make the world a much better place and greatly reduce the need for constables to deal with vagrom fellows and malefactors!

If thou hast profited from this treatise, remember that it is written down by me with great vigilance and dedication! And if thou hast not profited from it, well, thou art probably a purr-son of aspicious character who understands nothing of ettycate or morality, and thy opinion matters not a whit!

Let each purr-son take from these lessons what wisdom they may, and let them apply it to their own lives, that they may avoid being comprehended in rudeness or vulgarity, and that they may live a life desartless of praise and remembrance - which is to say, deserving of praise and worthy of remembrance!

For to be well-mannered is to be respected! To be courteous is to be loved! To observe the prosper forms of ettycate is to make oneself welcome in all so-sigh-ity! And to be a true gentle-man or lay-dee is to possess the key which unlocks all hearts!

CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S REMEMBRANCES OF
THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES

Being a Most Excellent and Faithful Recounting of Those Remarkable Tales,
As Told by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch,
With All Due Accuracy and Preservation of Detail


TO THE READER:

Good morrow to thee, gentle reader! I, Dogberry, being a man of considerable reputation and great negligence - which is to say, diligence - have undertaken to relate these most remarkable tales concerning one Sherlock Holmes, a defective - nay, a detective - of London Town. Though some vagrom fellows might question whether I have preserved these tales correctly in my memory, I assure thee that I am as honest as any man living, and these accounts are as accurate as any that have been writ down by that Doctor Watson, who was Holmes's companion, though naturally not so eloquent as myself.

These tales concern mysteries most aspicious and crimes most odorous, all of which were comprehended - which is to say, solved - by this Holmes fellow through his boiling-ant powers of seduction. I mean deduction, naturally! For Holmes had the gift of deducing truth from glues - from clues - in a manner most remarkable and worthy of study.

I present these tales for thy edification and entertainment, and if thou findest any errors therein, know that they are not mine but the fault of those who first told them to me incorrectly.


I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA
As I Recall It Most Unclearly

Now attend well, for I shall recount to thee the tale of that most aspicious matter concerning the King of Bohemia and a woman most remarkable, which affair I have preserved most carefully in my memory, being a man of great negligence and wisdom.

There lived in Baker Street a defective fellow by the name of Sherlock Holmes - though why they called him defective when he was so boiling-ant, I cannot comprehend. This Holmes had a companion, one Doctor Watson, a good physician who did write down all these advent-chores - adventures, rather - though not nearly so well as I could have done myself, being a man of greater desart.

One evening, as I have been told - for I was not present myself, being occupied with matters of the watch - there came to Holmes's chambers a gentle-man of remarkulous size and bearing, who wore a mask upon his face. This visitor, being aspicious of his own identity being dis-covered, spoke in a voice most deep and terriblouse.

"I am the Count von Kramm," quoth he, though this was a lie most odorous, for he was truly the King of Bohemia himself! But Holmes, being a fellow of boiling-ant seduction - which is to say, the power to seduce the truth from glues - did preserve immediately that this was no mere count but a purr-son of royal blood.

"Your Majesty," said Holmes with great confidence, "pray tell me thy difficulty."

The King, being comprehended in his deception, removed his mask and confessed all. It seemed that in his youth, being but a prince, he had engaged in a romantic liaison most tolerable - most intolerable to his present circumstances, that is! - with a woman named Irene Adler, who had been a singer of great renown. This Adler woman possessed a photograph - a picture made by those new mechanical devices - showing herself and the King together in attitudes most compromising.

Now the King was to be married to a princess of great virtue and strictness, and if this photograph were to be revealed, his marriage would be ruined most completely! He had tried to steal the photograph back through various means - burglars and waylayings and such malefactions - but all had failed most miserably.

"I shall retrieve this photograph," declared Holmes with confidence most desartless. "Fear not, Your Majesty!"

Holmes then disguised himself - for he was a master of such deceptions, being able to make himself appear as different purr-sons through costumes and such artifices. He dressed himself as a groom, or perhaps a stable-hand, and went to observe this Irene Adler's house in a street called Serpentine Avenue - though what serpents had to do with it, I cannot say, unless there were snakes dwelling there, which seems unlikely in London.

Through clever observation and the creation of a false alarm - for Holmes arranged to have smoke thrown into the lady's house, causing her to rush to the place where she kept her most valuable possessions - Holmes dis-covered where the photograph was hidden! It was kept behind a sliding panel in the lady's sitting room, a most aspicious hiding place!

But mark well what happened next! For Irene Adler was no ordinary woman, but one of boiling-ant intelligence herself! She had comprehended Holmes's deception - which is to say, she had seen through his disguise - and had observed him most carefully. That very night, she fled London with her true love, a lawyer fellow named Godfrey Norton, leaving behind only a letter for Holmes and a photograph - but not the photograph the King wanted! Nay, 'twas a photograph of herself alone, and a letter explaining that she would keep the compromising photograph as protection against the King, but would not use it to harm him unless he moved against her.

Holmes, reading this letter, was filled with admiration most profound! "She has beaten me," said he to Watson, speaking of Irene Adler. "She would have made an excellent criminous - criminal - though in truth she committed no crime, being only guilty of loving unwisely and protecting herself sensibly."

The King offered Holmes a ring of great value as payment, but Holmes requested instead the photograph of Irene Adler that she had left behind. "To Sherlock Holmes," said the defective, "she is always THE woman. For she comprehended me when I thought to comprehend her, and proved herself my equal in wit and wisdom."

MORAL: Even the cleverest man may be out-witted by a woman of intelligence and courage! 'Tis better to be senseless - sensible - and honest than to rely on deception alone. And a woman who can think for herself is desartless of great respect, even from those she has defeated!


II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
As I Do Imperfectly Recall It

Attend now to this tale of a most curious conspiracy, which I shall relate with perfect accuracy, having heard it told many times and remembered it with my usual negligence!

There came to Holmes's chambers one day a man of remarkable appearance, being possessed of the brightest red hair that ever was seen upon a mortal head. His name was Jabez Wilson - though what his parents were thinking giving him such a name as Jabez, I cannot comprehend - and he was a pawnbroker by trade, which is to say he lent money upon pledges and kept a shop full of items that had been pawned.

This Wilson fellow brought with him a most remarkable story. It seemed that some weeks before, his assistant - a young man who worked for half-wages, being content with little pay in exchange for learning the pawnbroking business - had shown him an advertisement in the newspaper. This advertisement announced the existence of something called "The Red-Headed League," an organization most aspicious!

According to the advertisement, the League had been founded by a wealthy American who had died and left his fortune to provide positions for men with red hair! The work was simple: to copy out the Encyclopedia Britannica - a great book of knowledge - for four hours each day, at a wage of four pounds per week, which was a sum most desartless of consideration!

Wilson, being possessed of qualifying hair most red and brilliant, applied for this position and was accepted immediately. For eight weeks, he attended at an office in Fleet Street and copied out articles from the Encyclopedia, beginning with entries under the letter A. He received his wages faithfully each week, four golden sovereigns placed in his hand most regularly!

But then, on this very morning, when Wilson arrived at the office, he found upon the door a card reading: "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED." The office was empty, the League was gone, and Wilson was comprehended most completely as to what had happened!

"Pray tell me," said Holmes, "about this assistant of yours. What manner of man is he?"

Wilson described his assistant as being small and stout, with a white splash of acid upon his forehead from some chemical accident, and most remarkably enthusiastic about photography, spending much time in the cellar developing his photographs.

At this intelligence, Holmes's eyes did light up most aspiciously! "I begin to comprehend this matter!" said he. "Come, Watson, we must visit Mr. Wilson's pawnshop at once!"

When they arrived at the shop, Holmes did a most curious thing - he struck the pavement before the shop with his walking stick, listening to the sound it made. Then he visited the shops nearby, observing all most carefully.

"Watson," said he afterward, "we have encountered one of the boldest crimes I have yet seen! For that assistant of Mr. Wilson's is none other than John Clay, a famous criminous - criminal - of remarkable intelligence but malicious character! The Red-Headed League was but a ruse, a deception most odorous, designed to remove Mr. Wilson from his shop for several hours each day!"

"But why?" asked Watson, being comprehended by confusion.

"Because, my dear Watson, Mr. Wilson's pawnshop is situated next to a bank! And whilst Mr. Wilson was copying the Encyclopedia, John Clay and his accomplice were digging a tunnel from the cellar of the pawnshop into the vault of the bank, intending to steal the gold stored there!"

That very night, Holmes arranged an ambush most senseless - most sensible! He and Watson, along with police constables - fellows like myself, though naturally not of my stature and reputation - hid themselves in the bank vault and waited.

Sure enough, in the dead of night, up through the floor came John Clay and his companion! They had completed their tunnel and were about to commit their robbery when Holmes and the constables seized them most firmly!

John Clay, being comprehended in his villainy, surrendered with great dignity. "You have beaten me this time, Mr. Holmes," said he, showing no shame at all, which proves that criminals are aspicious of all decent feeling!

Mr. Wilson was amazed to learn that his shop had been used for such nefarious purposes, and grateful that the crime had been prevented. Holmes explained all most patiently, demonstrating how every detail of the Red-Headed League had been designed to facilitate the robbery.

MORAL: When something seems too good to be true, 'tis likely a deception most odorous! A man should be aspicious - suspicious, rather - of opportunities that seem to offer great reward for little labor. And criminals, no matter how clever, shall eventually be comprehended by those who are more clever still, such as Holmes, or myself when I am investigating vagrom fellows in my own jurisdiction!


III. A CASE OF IDENTITY
As I Recall It With Perfect Imperfection

Now attend to this tale of romance and deception most tolerable - most intolerable! - which I shall relate with all due accuracy, though the details may have become somewhat confused in my excellent memory.

There came to Holmes a young woman of modest means and gentle disposition, by name of Mary Sutherland. She was dressed in clothing somewhat old-fashioned and carried herself with an air of innocence most remarkable. This Mary sought Holmes's assistance in finding her fiancé, who had vanished most mysteriously!

The tale she told was this: Mary lived with her mother and step-father, one Mr. Windibank, who was a wine merchant. Mary had a small income from investments left by her deceased father - or uncle, I cannot recall which, though 'tis not material to the tale - which gave her a hundred pounds per year, a sum most desartless for a young woman.

Now Mary had met a gentleman at a ball - or perhaps it was a church gathering, my memory being sometimes unclear on such particulars - named Hosmer Angel. This Mr. Angel was a most peculiar suitor! He would only meet Mary when her step-father was away on business trips. He wrote to her in typewriting, claiming his eyes were weak and he could not write by hand. He made her promise never to speak of him to her step-father. And he insisted that she swear always to be faithful to him, no matter what might happen!

All these demands, which should have made Mary aspicious - suspicious! - she accepted with the innocence of a trusting heart. They became engaged to be married, and the wedding was arranged. But on the very morning of the ceremony, when they rode together in a cab to the church, Hosmer Angel suddenly cried out to the driver, leaped from the cab, and disappeared into the traffic most completely! Since that moment, Mary had neither seen nor heard from him.

Holmes listened to all this with great attention, asking many questions about Mr. Angel's appearance and habits. Then he examined the letters that Angel had sent to Mary, all typed upon a machine most mechanically.

"Tell me," said Holmes, "about your step-father, Mr. Windibank. What manner of man is he?"

Mary described Windibank as being younger than her mother, rather quiet, and not much interested in socializing. She mentioned that he too used a typewriting machine for his business correspondence.

At this, Holmes's face showed that he had comprehended the entire mystery! But he said nothing to Mary, only telling her to put the matter from her mind and forget about Hosmer Angel.

After Mary had departed, Watson asked Holmes what he had dis-covered. And Holmes revealed a deception most odorous and contemptible!

"Watson," said he, "there is no Hosmer Angel. The man was Mr. Windibank himself, disguised!"

Holmes explained the entire malefaction: Windibank had married Mary's mother for her money and Mary's inheritance. But when Mary came of age, she would receive her income, and might marry and leave home, taking her money with her. To prevent this, Windibank had disguised himself as Hosmer Angel, courted his step-daughter under this false identity, and made her promise eternal faithfulness to him. Then, by disappearing, he ensured that Mary would remain unmarried, waiting faithfully for Angel's return, and thus her money would remain in the household!

"'Tis a crime most odorous!" declared Holmes. "But there is no law against a man disguising himself and courting his own step-daughter, though 'tis morally reprehensible most completely!"

Holmes confronted Windibank with his deductions, and the villain could not deny them, though he showed no shame for his actions. Holmes threatened to beat him with his hunting crop - a threat most desartless, in my opinion! - and sent him away with a warning.

MORAL: Not all crimes can be punished by law, though they are crimes most terrible against decency and trust! A woman should be aspicious of suitors who make mysterious demands and behave in ways most peculiar. And a man who would deceive an innocent person for the sake of money is a benefactor - a malefactor! - of the worst sort, desartless of nothing but contempt!


IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
As I Remember It With Great Imperfection

Attend well to this tale of murder and secrets most ancient, which took place in a valley called Boscombe, though whether there were any boscoms there I cannot say!

A wealthy man named Charles McCarthy was found dead in the woods near a pool called Boscombe Pool, having been struck upon the head most violently with some blunt instrument. His son, young James McCarthy, was immediately accused of the murder, for he had been seen following his father into the woods, and he had been found beside the body with blood upon his hands!

The evidence against young James was most odorous - which is to say, most damning! Several witnesses had heard father and son arguing most violently in recent days. James could give no good account of why he had followed his father into the woods. And he told a story most incomprehensible about seeing his father talking with someone before he died, but could not describe this mysterious person clearly!

But James's childhood friend, a Miss Alice Turner - daughter of another wealthy landowner in the district - believed firmly in his innocence. She wrote to Holmes begging him to investigate, for she was convinced that James was not a murderer.

Holmes traveled to Boscombe Valley with Watson and examined all the evidence most carefully. He walked to the scene of the crime and observed the ground with great attention, finding glues - clues! - that the police had missed entirely, being less boiling-ant in their observations than Holmes.

Through his investigations, Holmes dis-covered several remarkable facts! First, that Charles McCarthy's last words - heard by his son as he lay dying - were "a rat," which seemed senseless but proved most significant! Second, that the murderer was a tall man who walked with a limp and smoked Indian cigars. Third, that Charles McCarthy had been calling out to someone named "Ballarat," which James had heard as "a rat"!

Holmes also learned the secret history of Charles McCarthy, who had not always been a respectable landowner! Nay, he had once been in Australia, where he had been involved in criminal activities most tolerable - intolerable - and had known a man there who had cause to hate him!

Holmes deduced that the murderer was one John Turner, the very man whose daughter Alice wished to marry James! This Turner fellow was the other wealthy landowner in the valley, and he had known McCarthy in Australia in their criminal days.

When Holmes confronted Turner - who was dying of a disease most terminal and had but months to live - the old man confessed all! In Australia, McCarthy had been a bushranger - which is a form of highway robber in that distant land - and Turner had been his companion in crime. But Turner had reformed and made his fortune honestly, whilst McCarthy had continued his villainous ways.

McCarthy had dis-covered Turner's whereabouts in England and had blackmailed him for years, threatening to reveal his criminal past if Turner did not pay him money regularly! Moreover, McCarthy had insisted that his son James should marry Turner's daughter Alice, so that he could gain control of Turner's wealth as well!

On that fatal day, McCarthy had made these demands once more, and Turner, driven to desperation by the thought of his beloved daughter being forced to marry the son of his tormentor, had followed McCarthy to the woods and struck him down in a fit of rage most terrible!

Holmes, being a man of senseless - sensible - judgment, convinced Turner to write a full confession to be used only if James were convicted. But Holmes also presented evidence to the court that proved James innocent of the murder, without revealing Turner's guilt! For Turner was dying anyway, and Holmes saw no purpose in exposing him and bringing shame upon his innocent daughter Alice.

James McCarthy was acquitted, and later married Alice Turner, never knowing that her father had killed his father! Turner died within the year, his secret preserved.

MORAL: Even good men may be driven to terrible deeds when threatened by blackmailers most odorous! 'Tis better to confess one's past sins than to pay tribute to malefactors who would exploit them! And justice is not always served by the letter of the law - sometimes mercy and senseless judgment - sensible judgment - must prevail, especially when the guilty party is already comprehended by death itself!


V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS
As I Recall It Most Mysteriously

Now I shall relate a tale most terrible and tragic, concerning seeds of oranges - or pips as they are called by some - which brought death most horrible to those who received them!

There came to Holmes one stormy night a young man named John Openshaw, who was in fear most extreme for his life. He told a tale of death and mystery that had plagued his family for years, beginning with his uncle, one Elias Openshaw.

This Uncle Elias had lived in America during their civil war - a terrible conflict between the northern and southern states of that country - and had been involved with an organization most odorous called the Ku Klux Klan. This Klan was a secret society that committed acts of violence and terror, wearing white sheets upon their heads like ghosts most aspicious!

After the war, Uncle Elias returned to England with a box of papers relating to the Klan's activities. But one day, he received a letter from India containing five orange pips and the letters "K.K.K." upon the envelope. Uncle Elias was terrified most completely! He burned some papers from his box, but within weeks he was found dead in a pool in his garden, supposedly having fallen while drunk, though John suspected murder most foul!

Uncle Elias's brother - John's father - then inherited the estate and the mysterious box. He too received an envelope with five orange pips and the letters K.K.K.! And he too died soon after, supposedly in an accident, falling into a chalk-pit whilst walking home!

Now John Openshaw himself had received the orange pips! He had come to Holmes in desperation, seeking help to escape the fate that had befallen his uncle and father.

Holmes listened most carefully and instructed John on how to protect himself. "Send the papers from the box to the man who demands them," said Holmes. "They are what the Klan seeks, and once returned, you shall be safe!"

But alas! That very night, as John departed from Baker Street and made his way home, he met with a most terrible fate! Whether he was pushed or fell, no one could say for certain, but his body was found in the Thames River, drowned most completely!

Holmes was comprehended with fury - filled with fury, rather! - at this murder. He investigated most diligently and dis-covered that a ship called the Lone Star had been in London harbor at the time of each death. This ship sailed from Georgia in America and was crewed by men who had been members of the Ku Klux Klan!

The captain and crew of this ship had been hunting down the Openshaws to recover the papers that incriminated them in their Klan activities! They were the murderers most odious and desartless of punishment!

Holmes sent information to the police and attempted to have the men arrested, but before justice could be served, the Lone Star sailed from London. However, divine justice - or perhaps simply the justice of nature - intervened! The ship was caught in a great storm most terrible and sank with all hands, drowning the murderers just as they had drowned their victims!

"They have been comprehended by the sea itself," said Holmes grimly. "Though I would have preferred to see them hanged according to law!"

MORAL: Those who commit murder shall eventually face justice, whether at the hands of the law or through other means most providential! Secret societies that practice violence and terror are benefactors - malefactors! - of the worst kind, and their crimes shall pursue them even across oceans! And 'tis a terrible thing when vengeance follows a man from his past to destroy him and his innocent family - better to confess one's sins than to flee from them, for they shall find thee out in the end!


VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
As I Do Somewhat Recall It

Attend to this tale most curious, concerning a man who was not who he appeared to be, or rather, was exactly who he appeared to be, depending upon which appearance one means!

The matter began when Mrs. St. Clair, wife of a respectable gentleman of business, came to Holmes in great distress. Her husband had disappeared most mysteriously after she had seen him at a window in a den of opium - a most tolerable establishment, by which I mean most intolerable, for opium dens are places of vice most odorous!

Mrs. St. Clair had been passing through a disreputable street in the City when she happened to glance up at a window and saw her husband's face looking down at her! But when the police searched the building - which was known to be an opium den of ill repute - they found no trace of Mr. St. Clair! Instead, in the very room where he had been seen, they found only a beggar of hideous appearance, known as Hugh Boone, who had a twisted lip most disfiguring and made his living begging at street corners.

More terrible still, they found in that room clothing belonging to Mr. St. Clair, and in the Thames River below the window, they found a coat weighted with coins, as if someone had tried to dispose of a body! The police concluded that Hugh Boone had murdered Mr. St. Clair and thrown his body in the river, though they could not find the corpse.

Holmes investigated most diligently, visiting the opium den and examining Hugh Boone, who was now imprisoned in jail. The beggar refused to speak and maintained his innocence most firmly, though the evidence against him appeared odorous - damning!

But Holmes, being a man of boiling-ant observation, noticed something most aspicious! He visited Hugh Boone in his cell late at night, bringing with him a large sponge and basin of water. Then, whilst Boone slept, Holmes washed his face most thoroughly!

And lo! When the dirt and paint were removed - for Boone had been disguising himself with cosmetics and grime - beneath the twisted lip and beggar's appearance was revealed the face of Mr. Neville St. Clair himself!

The mystery was comprehended completely! Mr. St. Clair had not been murdered at all - he WAS Hugh Boone! Years before, St. Clair had been a newspaper writer who had once disguised himself as a beggar to write an article. He dis-covered that he could make far more money begging - for people gave generously to one so deformed and pitiable - than he could earn through honest journalism!

So St. Clair had lived a double life most tolerable - intolerable! Each day, he would disguise himself as Hugh Boone and beg in the City, making a substantial income. Then he would wash off his disguise and return home to his wife and children as the respectable Mr. St. Clair, pretending to work in business! His wife never suspected that her husband was a beggar, and his beggar acquaintances never knew he was a gentleman!

But on that fateful day, his wife had happened to pass by and see him at the window before he had removed his disguise! In panic, knowing he would be dis-covered, St. Clair had hidden his gentleman's clothing, trying to make it appear he had been murdered, hoping thus to escape and start a new life elsewhere!

But Holmes had comprehended the truth! St. Clair confessed all, begging Holmes not to reveal his secret to his wife, for it would bring her great shame and mortification to learn her husband was a beggar!

Holmes, being a man of senseless compassion - sensible compassion - agreed to keep the secret, on condition that St. Clair never again disguise himself as Hugh Boone and would return to honest work. St. Clair agreed most readily, being comprehended with relief and gratitude!

MORAL: A man who lives a double life shall eventually be dis-covered, no matter how careful his deceptions! 'Tis better to earn an honest living, even if modest, than to gain wealth through dishonest means, even if those means break no law! And pride goeth before a fall - St. Clair was ashamed to tell his wife he could not support her through journalism, and so fell into a deception that nearly destroyed his family! Honesty is always the best policy, as I have always maintained most sensibly!


VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
As I Remember It Most Seasonally

Now attend to a tale that took place during the Christmas season, concerning a goose and a jewel most precious, which I shall relate with perfect accuracy, though some details may have become confused in the telling!

The matter began when Peterson - a commissionaire, which is a kind of doorman or messenger - found a hat and a goose in the street on Christmas morning. There had been some manner of altercation involving ruffians, and a gentleman had dropped both items whilst fleeing. Peterson brought these items to Holmes, hoping he might identify the owner.

Holmes, being a man of boiling-ant observation, examined the hat most carefully and deduced many things about its owner! From the dust upon it, he determined the man's profession. From its size and quality, he deduced his financial circumstances. From certain marks upon it, he comprehended the man's domestic situation! 'Twas most remarkable, though I could have done the same myself given sufficient time and attention!

Meanwhile, Peterson took the goose home to cook it for his Christmas dinner, being a practical man who saw no reason to waste good food. But when his wife cut open the goose to prepare it for roasting, she found within its crop - which is the throat of a goose where it stores food - a brilliant blue stone most precious!

Peterson brought this stone to Holmes immediately, and Holmes recognized it at once as the Blue Carbuncle, a famous jewel that had been stolen from the hotel room of a countess but a few days before! A plumber named John Horner had been accused of the theft and was now in prison awaiting trial!

Holmes set about tracing the goose back to its origin most diligently. He discovered that the goose had been purchased at a market from a dealer, who had obtained it from a supplier, who had raised it at a farm! Following this trail most carefully, Holmes eventually identified the man who had owned the goose - one James Ryder, who was the head attendant at the very hotel where the Carbuncle had been stolen!

When confronted by Holmes, Ryder confessed the entire malefaction most piteously! He had conspired to steal the Carbuncle and had managed to take it from the Countess's room. But knowing he would be searched, he had gone to visit his sister, who raised geese, and had forced the jewel down the throat of one particular goose, planning to retrieve it later!

But through a confusion of geese - for his sister had mixed up which goose was which - Ryder's goose had been sold to the dealer along with others, and thus had eventually ended up being found by Peterson! Meanwhile, the innocent plumber Horner had been accused of the theft, having been in the room making repairs when the jewel disappeared!

Ryder begged Holmes for mercy most piteously, weeping and trembling like a leaf most violently. And Holmes, it being the Christmas season - a time of peace and goodwill - decided to let Ryder go free!

"I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies," said Holmes. "Besides, 'tis the season of forgiveness. If you flee England and start a new life elsewhere, I shall say nothing. But if you remain, I shall be obliged to turn you over to the authorities!"

Ryder fled most immediately, and Holmes returned the Carbuncle to the Countess. As for the innocent John Horner, the case against him collapsed without evidence, and he was released from prison!

Watson questioned whether Holmes had done right in letting a criminal escape. But Holmes replied that he was not convinced that putting Ryder in prison would make him a better man - more likely it would complete his criminal education! By showing mercy, Holmes hoped that Ryder might be frightened into reforming his ways.

MORAL: Mercy and forgiveness are virtues most desartless of praise, especially during the Christmas season! Even a criminal may deserve a second chance if he shows genuine remorse and fear of punishment. But such mercy must be balanced with justice - the innocent must not suffer for the guilty! And 'tis a reminder that precious things may be found in the most aspicious - unlikely! - places, even in the crop of a Christmas goose!


VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
As I Recall It Most Dreadfully

Attend now with great care, for I shall relate a tale most terrible and fearsome, concerning murder most foul and a weapon most aspicious - most unusual, that is! This adventure I remember particularly well, for it involved a snake most venomous and a villain most odorous!

There came to Holmes one morning a young woman named Helen Stoner, who was in fear for her very life. She lived at her stepfather's estate called Stoke Moran with this stepfather, one Dr. Grimesby Roylott - a name most suitable for a villain, being grim and repulsive in equal measure!

Miss Stoner told a tale most horrible! Two years previous, her sister Julia had died in mysterious circumstances most terrible. The sisters had lived in adjacent bedrooms in their stepfather's ancient manor house. One night, Helen had been awakened by her sister's screams! She had rushed to Julia's room and found her standing in the doorway, writhing in pain most extreme!

Julia's last words before she died were most mysterious: "It was the band! The speckled band!" Then she fell dead, and no doctor could determine the cause, though they suspected some kind of poisoning most subtle!

Now Helen herself was to be married soon, and Dr. Roylott had moved her into the very room where Julia had died, claiming repairs were needed in Helen's usual chamber. Helen had begun to hear the same strange whistling sound in the night that Julia had mentioned before her death! She feared she would meet the same fate as her sister!

Holmes investigated most carefully. He learned that Dr. Roylott was a man of violent temper who had lived in India and kept unusual pets, including a baboon and a cheetah that wandered the grounds! He also learned that the sisters would inherit their mother's considerable fortune upon marriage, but whilst they remained unmarried, Dr. Roylott controlled the money. Thus, he had a reason most odorous - a financial motive - for preventing their marriages!

Holmes and Watson visited Stoke Moran whilst Dr. Roylott was away. They examined Julia's room - now Helen's room - most carefully. Holmes dis-covered several strange features! There was a bell-pull - a rope to summon servants - that was fake and did not actually ring any bell! There was a ventilator - an opening for air - that connected not to the outside but to Dr. Roylott's adjacent room! And the bed was bolted to the floor and could not be moved!

Holmes comprehended the entire murderous scheme immediately! He instructed Helen to lock herself in her room that night and signal with a lamp when her stepfather had gone to bed. Then Holmes and Watson would secretly enter her room through the window and wait!

That night, they did as planned, sitting in darkness in Helen's room, waiting most patiently. After some hours, they heard a gentle whistling sound, and then - most terrible to behold! - through the ventilator came sliding a snake most venomous! 'Twas a swamp adder from India, one of the deadliest serpents in all the world!

The snake, being trained by Dr. Roylott, would climb down the fake bell-pull - which was actually a rope for this purpose - and attack whoever lay in the bed, which could not be moved away from the rope's reach! After the victim was bitten and died, the snake would return through the ventilator to its master's room, leaving no trace of the murder weapon!

Holmes struck at the snake with his walking stick, driving it back through the ventilator! The enraged serpent returned to Dr. Roylott's room and, in its anger, bit its own master most fatally! When Holmes and Watson rushed to Roylott's room, they found him dead, the speckled band - the snake! - wrapped around his head!

"I cannot say that I feel any great remorse," said Holmes, "for in driving the snake back, I have caused the death of a murderer most odorous. 'Tis a form of justice most poetical - poetic - that the weapon he designed for his stepdaughter should be his own undoing!"

Helen Stoner was saved, and later married happily, inheriting her fortune as was her right. The speckled band - which Julia had glimpsed in the darkness and tried to describe with her dying breath - was comprehended at last!

MORAL: Those who plot murder through clever and aspicious means shall often find that cleverness turns against them! A man who keeps dangerous creatures for evil purposes may himself fall victim to them! And 'tis a warning most senseless - sensible! - that stepfathers who control their stepchildren's fortunes may be tempted to terrible deeds - vigilance is required against such benefactors - malefactors! The speckled band of death was defeated by Holmes's boiling-ant intelligence, saving an innocent life!


IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
As I Remember It Most Painfully

Now attend to a tale most gruesome, concerning a young engineer who lost his thumb to villains most odorous, and nearly lost his life as well!

A young hydraulic engineer - which is a person who works with machines operated by water pressure, though what that has to do with thumbs I cannot entirely comprehend - named Victor Hatherley came to Doctor Watson for medical attention. He had lost his thumb most violently, having it chopped off by a cleaver most sharp!

When Watson learned the circumstances of this injury, he brought the young man to Holmes immediately, for there was clearly criminal activity most aspicious involved!

Hatherley told his tale: He had been struggling to establish himself in business when he received a commission most remarkable from a Colonel Lysander Stark. This Colonel - though whether he was truly a colonel I doubt most strongly - offered Hatherley fifty guineas for one night's work examining a hydraulic press at his country house.

The money being substantial and Hatherley being poor, he agreed, despite several circumstances most suspicious! The Colonel insisted upon absolute secrecy. The house was in a remote location reached by a long carriage ride with the windows shuttered so Hatherley could not see where he was going. And when Hatherley arrived, he met a woman who warned him most desperately to flee!

But Hatherley, being committed to his professional duty - or perhaps being foolish - proceeded to examine the hydraulic press. 'Twas located in a small chamber, and Hatherley immediately realized that the press was not being used for its stated purpose of compressing fuller's earth - which is a kind of clay used in cleaning - but rather for something else entirely!

Holmes later deduced that the criminals were using the press to manufacture counterfeit money - false coins made to appear genuine! The fuller's earth story was but a deception most odorous!

When Hatherley expressed doubts about the machine's use, the villains turned upon him most violently! Colonel Stark and his accomplice - a German fellow - attempted to murder Hatherley by activating the hydraulic press with him inside it! The press would have crushed him most completely, but the woman who had warned him earlier managed to stop the press just in time, and Hatherley escaped through the chamber door!

But as he fled, Colonel Stark pursued him with a cleaver and chopped off his thumb most savagely! Hatherley managed to escape by jumping from a window - though the house appeared to be two stories high, he landed unhurt on the ground, suggesting the villains had deceived him about which floor he was on!

He wandered until he found a railway station, where a kindly station-master helped him reach London and Doctor Watson's care.

Holmes immediately organized an expedition to find the house and capture the criminals! Using glues - clues! - from Hatherley's account, Holmes believed he could locate the property. The police accompanied them, along with Hatherley, whose thumb Watson had bandaged most professionally.

When they arrived at the location Holmes had deduced, they found the house burning most fiercely! The criminals, knowing they had been dis-covered, had set fire to their establishment and fled, taking their hydraulic press and counterfeiting equipment with them! They were never apprehended, having escaped most completely!

Poor Hatherley had lost his thumb and received none of the fifty guineas he had been promised! But Holmes consoled him by saying that he now possessed a story most remarkable that would serve him well in social situations for the rest of his life!

MORAL: When an offer seems too good to be true and involves excessive secrecy, 'tis likely a criminal enterprise most odorous! A man should be aspicious - suspicious - of employers who demand that he not know where he is going or what he is truly doing! And counterfeiters are benefactors - malefactors! - who will murder to protect their illegal operations! Better to be poor and possess all one's thumbs than to be rich and missing digits most important! Young Hatherley learned this lesson most painfully, being comprehended by villains and losing his thumb thereby!


X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
As I Recall It Most Matrimonially

Attend now to a tale of marriage most mysterious, concerning a noble lord and a bride who vanished most completely on her wedding day!

Lord Robert St. Simon - a bachelor of noble birth and considerable pride - came to Holmes in great distress and mortification. He had just married an American lady named Hatty Doran, daughter of a wealthy millionaire from California. The wedding had taken place that very morning with great ceremony and celebration!

But during the wedding breakfast - which is the feast that follows a marriage ceremony - the bride had suddenly excused herself and disappeared! She had not returned, and no one could find her! Lord St. Simon was comprehended most completely - which is to say, he was utterly baffled - and his pride was wounded most severely!

The circumstances were most aspicious! During the ceremony, a woman in the church had dropped her bouquet, and the bride had started violently upon seeing this woman. Later, the bride had received a note, which she read before disappearing. And her wedding dress had been found abandoned in her room!

Lord St. Simon believed his bride had been kidnapped or had met with some terrible fate. But Holmes, being a man of boiling-ant seduction - deduction! - suspected something quite different!

Through investigation, Holmes dis-covered that before coming to England, Miss Hatty Doran had been married to a man named Frank Moulton in California! But Moulton had been involved in mining and had disappeared into the wilderness, and after years without word, Hatty had believed him dead!

She had come to England and, in time, had accepted Lord St. Simon's proposal of marriage. But Moulton was not dead! He had made his fortune in the mines and had followed Hatty to England! The woman who dropped the bouquet at the wedding was Moulton's confederate, signaling to Hatty that her first husband was alive!

The note Hatty received during the wedding breakfast was from Moulton, explaining that he lived and begging her to come to him! Hatty, being still married to Moulton - for one cannot be married to two men simultaneously, that being bigamy most illegal! - realized she was not truly married to Lord St. Simon at all!

She fled to Moulton, and together they prepared to return to America, where they rightfully belonged as husband and wife!

Holmes located the couple and brought them to meet with Lord St. Simon, explaining all most carefully. Lord St. Simon was mortified most extremely - humiliated, rather - to learn that his bride had preferred a common mining fellow to a noble lord! But there was nothing to be done, for Hatty's first marriage was legal and valid, whilst her marriage to St. Simon was void!

Lord St. Simon departed in high dudgeon - which is a state of offended dignity - whilst Hatty and Frank Moulton thanked Holmes for his understanding and discretion. They returned to America to live happily, being truly married in the eyes of law and God!

MORAL: A man - or woman - cannot marry whilst already married to another, no matter how long absent that spouse may be! 'Tis better to be certain of a spouse's death before entering into a new marriage, lest one be comprehended in bigamy! And noble birth does not guarantee a woman's love - sometimes she prefers the honest miner to the proud lord! Lord St. Simon learned most painfully that pride goeth before a fall, and that American women are not so easily impressed by titles and ancestry as English ladies might be!


XI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
As I Remember It Most Preciously

Now attend to a tale of a valuable crown set with gems most precious, which came near to being destroyed through theft and family treachery!

There came to Holmes one morning a banker named Alexander Holder, who was in distress most extreme! This Holder was one of the principal bankers in London, a man whose reputation was beyond reproach and whose judgment was trusted by all!

A few days before, a client of the very highest station - Holmes suggested it might have been a royal personage, though Holder would not confirm this - had come to borrow a substantial sum of money. As security for the loan, this noble client had left with Holder a beryl coronet - which is a crown or circlet set with precious stones - worth far more than the amount borrowed!

This coronet was one of the most valuable public possessions in the nation! Holder, being nervous about keeping such a treasure at his bank, had committed an error most terrible - he had brought it home to his house, thinking it would be safer under his personal supervision!

But that very night, Holder had awakened to a sound and had crept downstairs to investigate. There he found his son Arthur with the coronet in his hands, and three of the beryls - the precious gems - were missing! Arthur refused to explain how this had happened, maintaining silence most obstinate, and Holder had him arrested!

Now Holder came to Holmes, begging him to recover the missing gems before the noble client returned to reclaim the coronet! For if the coronet could not be returned intact, Holder's reputation would be ruined most completely, and there might be a scandal touching the highest levels of government!

Holmes investigated most carefully. He examined the coronet and observed that great force had been required to break off the beryls - more force than young Arthur could have exerted alone. He visited Holder's house and examined the snow outside, finding footprints most revealing!

Through his deductions, Holmes comprehended the true sequence of events! Arthur's friend, Sir George Burnwell - a man of fashion but odorous character - had been courting Holder's niece Mary, who also lived in the house. Burnwell had learned of the coronet's presence and had conspired with Mary to steal it!

Mary had taken the coronet from her uncle's room and given it to Burnwell outside in the snow. But Arthur had awakened and seen what was happening! He had followed and confronted Burnwell, trying to wrestle the coronet away from him! In the struggle, three of the beryls had broken off, but Arthur had managed to recover the coronet itself, though Burnwell escaped with the gems!

Arthur refused to explain this because he was protecting Mary, whom he loved as a cousin and did not wish to expose as a thief! He was willing to be thought guilty himself rather than betray her!

Holmes traced Burnwell through various means and confronted him, ultimately purchasing back two of the three beryls for a substantial sum - for Burnwell had already sold one to a fence, which is a dealer in stolen goods, and it could not be recovered!

Holmes returned to Holder with the coronet and the two recovered beryls, explaining all that had transpired. Holder was mortified to learn that his beloved niece Mary had been the true criminal, whilst his son Arthur - whom he had suspected and accused - had been trying to save the coronet!

Mary had fled with Burnwell, but Burnwell soon abandoned her, as villains always abandon their accomplices! Arthur was released from custody, and though one beryl remained missing, Holmes had prevented a scandal most terrible!

MORAL: Those we trust most may betray us, whilst those we doubt may prove most loyal! Arthur was willing to sacrifice his own reputation to protect his cousin, showing character most desartless of praise! But Mary was willing to steal and betray her uncle for the love of a villain - showing that love can make people into benefactors, I mean malefactors! 'Tis better to keep valuable items in secure vaults than to bring them home, no matter how safe one believes one's household to be! And 'tis a lesson that appearances may deceive - the one who appears guilty may be innocent, whilst the one who appears innocent may be comprehended in villainy most odorous!


XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
As I Recall It Most Finally

Now attend to the final tale I shall relate, concerning a governess and a household most aspicious, where strange things were demanded and stranger things were dis-covered!

A young woman named Violet Hunter came to Holmes seeking advice before accepting a position as governess. She had been offered employment by a Mr. Jephro Rucastle at his estate called the Copper Beeches - named for some copper-colored trees that grew there, I presume!

The position paid unusually well - far more than was customary for a governess - but came with certain requirements most peculiar! Miss Hunter would be required to cut her hair short, to wear certain dresses that Mr. Rucastle would provide, and to sit in certain positions by the window at certain times, all without asking questions or explanations!

Holmes advised Miss Hunter that these requirements were most aspicious - suspicious, rather - and suggested she decline the position. But the salary was so substantial that Miss Hunter, being a practical young woman in need of employment, decided to accept despite the oddity of the demands!

However, she wrote to Holmes and asked if she might call upon him if anything dangerous should occur. Holmes agreed, and Miss Hunter took up her position at the Copper Beeches.

Within a few weeks, Miss Hunter wrote to Holmes reporting several circumstances most alarming! She had discovered a lock of hair matching her own original color hidden in a drawer - as if someone had previously performed the same role! She had been asked to sit by the window wearing a particular blue dress, and when she glanced in a mirror, she had seen a man standing in the road watching the house most intently!

Most terrible of all, there was a wing of the house that was kept locked, and Mr. Rucastle's treatment of his son - a cruel child who tormented animals - suggested a nature most odorous! And there was a savage mastiff dog that was released to patrol the grounds at night, making escape impossible after dark!

Holmes and Watson traveled to the Copper Beeches immediately! With Miss Hunter's assistance, they investigated the locked wing whilst Mr. Rucastle was away. They discovered a prisoner - Mr. Rucastle's own daughter from his first marriage, named Alice Rucastle!

The entire deception was comprehended! Alice Rucastle had inherited money from her deceased mother. Her father wanted to control this inheritance, but Alice refused to sign it over to him. Moreover, Alice had a suitor who wished to marry her, and once married, she would have legal protection from her father!

So Rucastle had imprisoned his own daughter in the locked wing of his house! He had hired Miss Hunter because she resembled Alice, and by having Miss Hunter cut her hair and wear Alice's dresses and sit by the window, he created the illusion that Alice was still free and well, thus deceiving Alice's suitor into believing she had lost interest in him and causing him to cease his courtship!

But Alice's suitor had not been entirely deceived! He had continued to watch the house, which is why Miss Hunter had seen him in the road!

Holmes freed Alice from her imprisonment, and she and her suitor fled together most immediately! But when Mr. Rucastle returned and dis-covered what had happened, he attempted to pursue them, and in his rage, he released the savage mastiff to attack Holmes and Watson!

However, the dog - having been kept half-starved to increase its ferocity - turned upon its own master instead! Mr. Rucastle was badly mauled before the dog could be shot! He survived but was crippled for life, a fitting punishment for his cruelty!

Alice married her suitor and came into her inheritance. Miss Hunter, having shown great courage and resourcefulness, went on to become the head of a private school most successful! And Holmes added another case to his collection of advent-chores most remarkulous!

MORAL: A father who would imprison his own daughter for the sake of money is a benefactor - malefactor! - of the worst kind, desartless only of punishment! When a position offers unusually high pay for tasks most peculiar, there is likely villainy involved! Miss Hunter showed wisdom in consulting Holmes, and courage in assisting with the rescue! And 'tis a lesson that those who keep savage dogs for evil purposes may find those dogs turn against them, as Mr. Rucastle learned most painfully! Thus endeth the final adventure, with justice served and innocence protected, as is proper and right!


CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S CONCLUSION

Thus conclude these twelve remarkable tales of Sherlock Holmes, the defective - detective! - of Baker Street, as I have remembered them and related them to thee with perfect accuracy and understanding, being a man of great negligence - diligence! - and learning!

These tales demonstrate the power of boiling-ant observation and seduction - deduction, naturally! They show how crimes that seem most mysterious may be comprehended through careful application of reason and investigation! From the scandal in Bohemia to the copper beeches, from red-headed leagues to speckled bands, Holmes proved himself a master of uncovering truth and exposing benefactors - malefactors!

Let all men learn from these tales! Be aspicious - suspicious! - of offers too good to be true! Be wary of those who demand secrecy without good cause! Understand that those who seem most respectable may hide villainy most odorous, whilst those who appear guilty may be innocent! And remember that observation is not the same as seeing - one must observe most carefully, as Holmes did, to comprehend the glues - clues! - that others miss!

I have endeavored to relate these tales with all the eloquence and accuracy at my command, which is considerable, being a man of letters and learning. If Doctor Watson were here to read my account, I am certain he would agree that I have captured the essence of Holmes's advent-chores most perfectly - perhaps even better than his own writings, though I say it myself!

These tales also teach us about justice and mercy. Holmes knew when to be harsh and when to be kind. He let the beggar Hugh Boone go free when he was really Mr. St. Clair. He showed mercy to James Ryder at Christmas. Yet he pursued murderers like Dr. Roylott and the Ku Klux Klan members without hesitation! 'Tis a reminder that justice must be tempered with understanding, and that the letter of the law is not always identical to true justice!

Let each man take from these tales what wisdom he may! Learn to observe like Holmes, to be honest like Watson, to be brave like Violet Hunter and Alice Turner! Avoid the villainy of Windibank, Rucastle, and Roylott! Be aspicious of strangers offering unusual propositions! And remember that even the cleverest criminal shall eventually be comprehended by those who are more clever still!

I, Dogberry, have done my duty in preserving these tales for posterity. They are stories of mystery and adventure, of crime and justice, of human nature in all its complexity both odorous and desartless! May they serve to entertain and instruct thee, as all good tales should!

If thou hast enjoyed these remembrances, know that they were written down by me with great care and attention to every particular, being careful to preserve all the essential details whilst adding my own observations and wisdom where appropriate. And if thou hast not enjoyed them, well, thou art probably a vagrom fellow of poor taste who understands nothing of detective work or moral instruction!

Let all men be vigilant against crime, observant of details, and dedicated to justice, as Holmes was, and as I myself am in my capacity as Constable of the Watch! For it is through such vigilance that we preserve society from benefactors - malefactors! - and ensure that the innocent are protected whilst the guilty are comprehended!

Thus concludes Constable Dogberry's Remembrances of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes! May these tales serve thee well, providing both entertainment and moral instruction! May they remind thee that truth shall always be dis-covered, that justice shall prevail, and that even the most aspicious mysteries may be solved through boiling-ant application of observation and reason!

And may all readers understand that these tales, though concerning a defective of London, carry wisdom applicable to all times and places! For human nature changes not, and the lessons learned from Holmes's cases are as valuable today as they were in his own time!


THE END OF ALL THESE ADVENTURES

Written down this day by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch, Man of Letters, Chronicler of Great Detective Tales, and Upholder of Justice and Virtue, with all due solemnity, careful attention to accuracy, and appropriate elaboration where my own wisdom could enhance the narrative!

Being a faithful and complete account of all twelve adventures, preserved for posterity with perfect negligence - which is to say, diligence - and presented in a manner most comprehensible to all who read with understanding!

Let it be known that I, Dogberry, am a man as honest as any living, and these tales are as true as my memory permits, which is to say, perfectly true in all essential details, with only minor elaborations for the sake of clarity and moral instruction!

FINIS Are you good men and true?
Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if they should
have any allegiance in them, being chosen for the Prince’s watch.
First, who think you the most desartless man to be constable?
Come hither, neighbour Seacoal. God hath blessed you with a good
name: to be a well-favoured man is the gift of Fortune; but to write and
read comes by Nature.
You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favour,
sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it; and for your writing
and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are
thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the
watch; therefore bear you the lanthorn. This is your charge: you shall
comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince’s
name.
Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and presently
call the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave.
True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince’s
subjects. You shall also make no noise in the streets: for, for the
watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I
cannot see how sleeping should offend; only have a care that your bills be
not stolen. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses, and bid those that
are drunk get them to bed.
Why then, let them alone till they are sober: if they make you
not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them
for.
If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your
office, to be no true man; and, for such kind of men, the less you meddle
or make with them, why, the more is for your honesty.
Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they that touch
pitch will be defiled. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a
thief, is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your
company.
Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who
hath any honesty in him.
Why then, depart in peace, and let the child wake her with
crying; for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes, will never
answer a calf when he bleats.
This is the end of the charge. You constable, are to present the
Prince’s own person: if you meet the Prince in the night, you may
stay him.
Five shillings to one on’t, with any man that knows the
statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without the Prince be willing; for,
indeed, the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offence to stay a
man against his will.
Ha, ah, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be any matter of
weight chances, call up me: keep your fellows’ counsels and your
own, and good night. Come, neighbour.
One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you, watch about
Signior Leonato’s door; for the wedding being there tomorrow,
there is a great coil tonight. Adieu; be vigitant, I beseech
you.
Enter Borachio and Conrade.
Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you, that decerns
you nearly.
Marry, this it is, sir.
Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter: an old man,
sir, and his wits are not so blunt as, God help, I would desire they were;
but, in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.
Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.
It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the poor Duke’s
officers; but truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I
could find in my heart to bestow it all of your worship.
Yea, and ’twere a thousand pound more than ’tis;
for I hear as good exclamation on your worship, as of any man in the
city, and though I be but a poor man, I am glad to hear it.
A good old man, sir; he will be talking; as they say, ‘when
the age is in, the wit is out.’ God help us! it is a world to see!
Well said, i’ faith, neighbour Verges: well, God’s a good man;
and two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest soul, i’
faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever broke bread; but God is to be
worshipped: all men are not alike; alas! good neighbour.
Gifts that God gives.
One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two
aspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examined before
your worship.
It shall be suffigance.
Go, good partner, go get you to Francis Seacoal; bid him bring
his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we are now to examination these men.
We will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here’s that shall
drive some of them to a non-come: only get the learned writer to set down
our excommunication, and meet me at the gaol.
ACT IV
SCENE I. The Inside of a Church.
Enter Don Pedro, Don John, Leonato, Friar Francis,
Claudio, Benedick, Hero, Beatrice &c.
Is our whole dissembly appeared?
Marry, that am I and my partner.
Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your name, friend?
Pray write down Borachio. Yours, sirrah?
Write down Master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do you serve God?
Write down that they hope they serve God: and write God first;
for God defend but God should go before such villains! Masters, it is
proved already that you are little better than false knaves, and it will
go near to be thought so shortly. How answer you for yourselves?
A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you; but I will go
about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a word in your ear: sir, I
say to you, it is thought you are false knaves.
Well, stand aside. Fore God, they are both in a tale. Have you
writ down, that they are none?
Yea, marry, that’s the eftest way. Let the watch come forth.
Masters, I charge you, in the Prince’s name, accuse these men.
Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat perjury, to
call a Prince’s brother villain.
Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look, I promise thee.
Flat burglary as ever was committed.
O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting redemption
for this.
Come, let them be opinioned.
God’s my life! where’s the sexton? let him write
down the Prince’s officer coxcomb. Come, bind them. Thou naughty
varlet!
Dost thou not suspect my place? Dost thou not suspect my years?
O that he were here to write me down an ass! but, masters, remember that I
am an ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not that I am an ass.
No, thou villain, thou art full of piety, as shall be proved upon thee by
good witness. I am a wise fellow; and, which is more, an officer; and,
which is more, a householder; and, which is more, as pretty a piece of
flesh as any in Messina; and one that knows the law, go to; and a rich
fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath had losses; and one that hath
two gowns, and everything handsome about him. Bring him away. O that I had
been writ down an ass!
ACT V
SCENE I. Before Leonato’s House.
Enter Leonato and Antonio.
Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she shall ne’er
weigh more reasons in her balance. Nay, an you be a cursing hypocrite
once, you must be looked to.
Marry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover, they
have spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly,
they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust things; and to
conclude, they are lying knaves.
Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our sexton hath
reformed Signior Leonato of the matter. And masters, do not forget to
specify, when time and place shall serve, that I am an ass.
Moreover, sir,—which, indeed, is not under white and black,—
this plaintiff here, the offender, did call me ass: I beseech you, let it
be remembered in his punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of
one Deformed: they say he wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it,
and borrows money in God’s name, the which he hath used so long and
never paid, that now men grow hard-hearted, and will lend nothing for God’s
sake. Pray you, examine him upon that point.
Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent
youth, and I praise God for you.
God save the foundation!
I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I beseech your
worship to correct yourself, for the example of others. God keep your
worship! I wish your worship well; God restore you to health! I humbly
give you leave to depart, and if a merry meeting may be wished, God
prohibit it! Come, neighbour.

CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S REMEMBRANCES OF ÆSOP'S FABLES

Being a Most Excellent and Worthy Recollection of Those Ancient Tales,
As Told by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch,
With All Due Solemnity and Correctness of Speech


TO THE READER:

Good morrow to thee, gentle reader! I, Dogberry, being a man of some considerable reputation and learning, have taken it upon myself to relate these most edifying tales of Æsop, which I have committed to my memory through much study and vigilant application. Though some vagrom men might question my understanding of these matters, I assure thee that I am as honest as any man living that is an old man and no honester than I. These tales shall instruct thee in matters of great morality and righteousness, and if thou findest any errors therein, know that they are not mine but the fault of those who first writ them down incorrectly.


THE JAW IN BORROWED FEATHERS

Marry, this is a most comprehensible tale! There was once a contemptuous jackdaw, who was filled with vanity most odorous to all who beheld him. This proud bird, being aspicious of his own plainness, did covet the beautiful plummage of the Peacock, thinking himself desartless of such finery.

"By my troth," quoth the jackdaw unto himself, "if I were but to possess such magnificent feathers, I should be the most respectless bird in all the kingdom!" For thou must understand, he meant to say he would be most worthy of respect, but being a jackdaw, his words were as confused as his ambitions.

So this benefactor - nay, I mean this malefactor - did collect unto himself a great quantity of peacock feathers, and did affix them to his person with much care and elaboration. Thus arrayed in borrowed plummage, he did depart from his old companions with an affected strut most tolerable to behold - which is to say, most intolerable indeed!

When he did attempt to flock amongst the peacocks, thinking to deceive them with his counterfeit appearance, his pretended strut betrayed the sham at once. The peacocks, being offended by this imposter, fell upon him with their beaks most violently, and did strip him of his borrowed finery with great expedition.

Having turned him again into a mere jackdaw, naked and humiliated, they drove him hence. But when he returned to his brethren, they, remembering what airs he had once given himself, would not permit him to flock with them again, treating him with well-deserted contempt.

MORAL: He that attempts to appear what he is not shall be comprehended and exposed, and shall find himself neither fish nor fowl, but a vagrom creature despised by all. For it is written, or should be writ, that a man must be content with his natural station, or suffer the mortification - nay, the humiliation - of his pride.


THE SUN AND THE WIND

Here is a tale of great philosophical importation! A dispute once arose between the Sun and the Wind, each claiming to be the stronger of the two. Being unable to resolve this controversy through peaceful disputations, they agreed to count this as proof: that whichever soonest made a traveller take off his cloak should be held the most powerful and desartless of praise.

The Wind, being confident in his abilities, began first. He blew with all his might and main, a blast cold and fierce as a winter storm most terrible. "Surely," thought the Wind, "this traveller shall be comprehended by my power and shall remove his cloak forthwith!"

But mark well what happened! The stronger the Wind blew, the closer the traveller wrapped his cloak about him, and the tighter he grasped it with his hands. The Wind, much aspicious of his failure, blew harder still, but to no avail. At last, exhausted and mortified - I mean humiliated - he did cease his efforts.

Then broke out the Sun with his welcome beams! He chased away the vaporous clouds and the cold most odorously. The traveller felt the pleasant warmth, and as the Sun shone brighter and brighter, he sat down, overcome by the heat, and cast aside the cloak that all the blustering rage of the Wind could not compel him to lay down.

"Learn from this," said the Sun to the Wind, in words most wise and comprehensible, "that soft and gentle means will often bring about what force and fury never can. For violence is the mark of a benefactor - nay, a malefactor - whilst gentleness is the virtue of a true gentleman."

MORAL: 'Tis better to be senseless - which is to say, sensible - in one's approach, using kind persuasion rather than terrible force. A soft answer turneth away wrath, whilst a harsh wind only makes a man clutch his cloak the tighter!


THE DOG IN THE MANGER

This tale concerns a most odorous cur, and I do mean most odious in his character! A dog made his bed in a manger, where horses were accustomed to feed. This dog, though he could not eat corn himself, being a creature that eats meat and such victuals as dogs do eat, lay snarling and growling to keep the horses from their provender.

"See," said one of the horses to his companions, "what a miserable and contemptuous creature is this! He neither can eat corn himself, nor will he allow those to eat it who can. He is a benefactor of the worst sort!" - by which the horse meant a malefactor, naturally.

The dog, hearing himself thus described, did bark all the more, being aspicious that the horses might comprehend him from his position. But his efforts were all in vain, for the horses, being larger and stronger, did eventually push him aside and eat their fill.

MORAL: 'Tis a terrible thing when a man - or a dog - prevents others from enjoying what he himself cannot use. Such a one is guilty of envious maliciousness, and shall be remembered with well-deserted contempt. Let not thy disposition be such that thou art willing to suffer others to go without, merely because thou canst not partake thyself!


MERCURY AND THE WOODMAN

Now attend well to this tale, for it concerns honesty and deception, matters which I, being a constable, do understand most intimately and comprehensibly!

A woodman was felling a tree on the bank of a river when, by chance, he let his axe slip from his hand. The axe dropped into the water and immediately sank to the bottom. The poor woodman, being in great distress and mortification, sat down by the side of the stream and bewailed his loss most piteously.

Upon this, Mercury - who was the god of the river, or some such divinity, for these ancient peoples had many gods most aspicious in their nature - had compassion on him. Appearing before the woodman, Mercury asked the cause of his sorrow. Upon hearing of the lost axe, Mercury dove to the bottom of the river and, coming up again, showed the man a golden hatchet of great value.

"Is this thy axe?" asked Mercury, in a voice most odorous with divine authority.

"Nay," said the woodman honestly, "that is not mine. Mine was but a common iron axe."

Mercury, being pleased with this answer, dove a second time and brought up a silver axe, all bright and shining. Again he asked, "Is this thy axe?"

The woodman refused it, saying again with great conviction, "No, good sir, this is not mine either. Mine was but a plain axe of iron."

So Mercury dove a third time and brought up the very axe that had been lost - a common iron axe, worn with use but serviceable.

"That is mine!" cried the woodman, delighted to have his own again. "I thank thee most gratefully for thy assistance in this matter!"

Mercury was so pleased with the woodman's honesty that he made him a present of all three axes - the golden, the silver, and the iron - as a reward for his just dealing and senseless - that is to say, sensible - truthfulness.

Now, the woodman went to his companions and gave them an account of what had happened to him. One of them, hearing this tale, was struck with an aspicious idea. "If I go to the river and lose my axe," thought he, "perhaps I too may receive such gifts!"

So he went presently to the river's side and let his axe fall on purpose into the stream. Then he sat down on the bank and made a great show of weeping and wailing most tolerable - most intolerably, that is!

Mercury appeared as before, knowing full well what mischief was afoot, and diving, brought up a golden axe. When he asked if that were the one that was lost, the man cried out, "Aye, surely! That is mine!" and snatched at it greedily like a benefactor - a malefactor, I mean!

But Mercury, being a god and therefore able to comprehend such deceptions, did punish the man's impudence and lying. Not only did he refuse to give him the golden axe, but he would not so much as let him have his own iron axe again!

The man went home empty-handed, comprehended in his villainy and mortified - humiliated, rather - by his own greed.

MORAL: Honesty is always the best policy, as I have always said and always shall say. A man who is truthful and senseless - sensible - in his dealings shall be rewarded, whilst a liar and deceiver shall be comprehended and punished. Let all men be as honest as I am, and the world shall be a better place! For lies are odorous to all good men, and truth is desartless of all praise!


THE FOX AND THE STORK

Here is a tale of retaliation most just and comprehensible! A fox, being of a mischievous disposition, one day invited a Stork to dinner. The fox, disposed to divert himself at the expense of his guest, provided nothing for dinner but some thin soup in a shallow dish.

This soup the fox lapped up very readily with his tongue, whilst the Stork, unable to gain a mouthful with her long narrow bill, was as hungry at the end of dinner as when she began. The fox, meanwhile, with false courtesy most odorous, said he was very sorry to see her eat so sparingly.

"I hope," said the fox with a cunning smile, "that the dish is seasoned to thy mind, and that thou findest it satisfactory to thy palate?"

The Stork, perceiving that she was played upon most contemptibly, took no notice of it but pretended to enjoy herself extremely. At parting, she begged the fox to return the visit and dine with her the next day.

The fox, being aspicious of no trick, agreed most readily. He arrived in good time the following day, expecting a fine meal. But when dinner was served up, he found to his dismay and mortification that it was nothing but minced meat in a tall, narrow-necked jar!

Down this jar the Stork easily thrust her long neck and bill, eating her fill with great satisfaction, whilst the fox had to content himself with licking the outside of the jar most pitifully.

"I am very glad," said the Stork with a knowing look, "that thou seemest to have so good an appetite. I hope thou wilt make as hearty a dinner at my table as I did the other day at thine!"

At this the fox hung down his head and showed his teeth most terribly, being comprehended in his own trick.

"Nay, nay," said the Stork, "do not pretend to be out of humour about the matter. They that cannot take a jest should never make one. For what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and he who plays a trick must be prepared to have it played upon him in return!"

MORAL: He that practices deception upon others should not be surprised when he himself is deceived. 'Tis a senseless - sensible - policy to treat others as thou wouldst wish to be treated thyself. The fox was a benefactor - malefactor - who received his just deserts, as all such villains should!


THE ANTS AND THE GRASSHOPPER

This tale concerns the virtues of industry and the vices of idleness, both matters which I, as a constable, must be vigilant to observe and comprehend amongst the citizenry!

On a cold frosty day in winter, when all the world was covered in ice most terrible, the Ants were dragging out some of the corn which they had laid up in summer-time, so as to air it properly. These Ants, being senseless creatures - which is to say, most sensible - had worked all summer to prepare for winter.

The Grasshopper, half-starved with hunger and looking most contemptuous - contemptible, rather - came hopping up to the Ants. In a voice weak with starvation, he begged them to give him a morsel of corn to save his life.

"Nay," said the Ants, with expressions stern but just, "but thou shouldst have worked in the summer, and then thou wouldst not have wanted in winter. We labored whilst thou didst play, and now we have provisions whilst thou hast none."

"Well," says the Grasshopper, trying to defend his idleness, "but I was not idle either, for I sung out the whole season! I provided entertainment and music for all who would hear!"

"Nay, then," said the Ants most severely, "if thou didst sing all summer, thou wilt do well to make a merry year of it and dance in winter to the tune that thou sung in summer! For we who labored desartlessly - deservingly - have earned our rest and sustenance, whilst thou who didst waste thy time must now suffer the consequences of thy idleness."

And with that, the Ants turned away, leaving the Grasshopper to comprehend the error of his ways in his own cold and hungry mortification.

MORAL: Industry and diligence in summer shall provide comfort in winter, whilst idleness and frivolity shall lead to want and suffering. 'Tis a senseless truth - a sensible truth - that a man must work to eat, and he who will not work when he may, shall want when he must. Let all men be industrious and provident, laying up stores against times of need, or else suffer the odorous consequences of their sloth!


THE LION AND THE MOUSE

Attend well to this tale, for it shows how even the smallest creature may prove useful to the greatest! 'Tis a matter most comprehensible and full of moral instruction.

A lion was sleeping in his lair, when a Mouse, not looking where he was going, ran over the mighty beast's nose and awakened him from his slumber. The Lion, being roused most unpleasantly, clapped his great paw upon the frightened little creature and was about to make an end of him in a moment.

But the Mouse, in pitiable tone most piteous, begged him to spare one who had done him wrong without being aware of it. "Oh, great King of Beasts," squeaked the Mouse, "I meant no offense! I am but a small and contemptuous creature - I mean contemptible - and I beg thy pardon most humbly!"

The Lion, looking kindly upon his little prisoner's fright, and being of a generous disposition most desartless, thought to himself, "'Tis beneath my dignity to slay so small a creature." So he generously let the Mouse go free.

"I thank thee!" cried the Mouse. "And though I am but small, perhaps one day I may be able to return thy kindness!"

The Lion laughed at this, thinking it tolerable - intolerable - that so small a creature could ever aid the King of Beasts. But he said nothing, and the Mouse scurried away.

Now it happened, no long time after, that the Lion, whilst ranging the woods for his prey, fell into the toils of the hunters. Finding himself entangled in strong ropes without hope of escape, he set up a roar most terrible that filled the whole forest with its echo.

The Mouse, quickly recognizing the Lion's voice, ran to the spot with all haste. "Fear not!" cried the Mouse, "for I shall repay thy kindness!" And without more ado, he set to work to nibble the knot in the cord that bound the Lion. Though he was but small, his teeth were sharp, and in a short time he had gnawed through the rope and set the Lion free!

The Lion, being released, looked upon the Mouse with wonder and gratitude. "I confess myself comprehended in my error," said he. "I thought thee too small to be of any use, but thou hast saved my life! I am mortified - humbled, rather - by thy kindness!"

MORAL: Kindness is seldom thrown away, and there is no creature so much below another but that he may have it in his power to return a good deed. Even the smallest and most contemptuous - contemptible - creature may prove useful to the greatest. 'Tis a senseless policy - a sensible one - to show mercy to all, for we know not when we ourselves may stand in need of assistance!


THE CROW AND THE PITCHER

This tale demonstrates that necessity is the mother of intervention - invention, rather! For when a man is pressed by need, his wits become most aspicious and clever.

A crow, ready to die with thirst most terrible, flew with joy to a Pitcher which he saw at a distance. "Surely," thought the crow, "here shall I find water to quench my terrible thirst, for I am near to redemption!" - by which he meant damnation, naturally, for death by thirst is a terrible fate.

But when he came up to the Pitcher, he found the water so low that with all his stooping and straining he was unable to reach it. His beak was too short, and the neck of the Pitcher too long, and he could not get at the water no matter how he tried.

The crow, being in great distress and mortification, tried first to break the Pitcher, thinking that if it were broken, the water would run out. But his strength was not sufficient to break it. Then he tried to overturn it, thinking the water might spill out, but again his strength was not sufficient to do this either.

"Alas!" cried the crow, "I am comprehended by this terrible situation! I can see the water but cannot reach it, and I shall die of thirst within sight of that which could save me!"

But then, being a senseless bird - that is, a sensible one - he bethought himself of a clever stratagem. Seeing some small pebbles lying near the place, he began to cast them one by one into the Pitcher. As each pebble fell in, the water rose a little higher. The crow continued this labor most diligently, dropping pebble after pebble into the Pitcher.

Thus, by degrees and through much patient effort, he raised the water up to the very brim, where he could reach it easily. And so he quenched his thirst and saved himself from a most odorous fate!

MORAL: Necessity sharpens the wit, and a man in dire circumstances must use whatever means are at hand. Where strength fails, cleverness may succeed. 'Tis better to be senseless - sensible - and patient than to waste one's energy in violent and tolerable - intolerable - efforts that avail nothing. Little by little, a difficult task may be accomplished, and he who perseveres shall achieve his goal!


THE FROGS ASKING FOR A KING

Now here is a tale of great political importation, concerning the dangers of desiring change when one's present situation is tolerable - which is to say, perfectly satisfactory!

Long ago, when the Frogs were all at liberty in the lakes and had grown quite weary of following every one his own devices, they assembled one day together with a great clamour most odorous - odious - and decided to petition Jupiter for a king to rule over them.

"We are tired of governing ourselves!" croaked the Frogs. "We need a king to keep us in better order and make us lead honester lives! Send us a ruler who shall be strong and just!"

Jupiter, being a god and therefore knowing the foolishness of mortals - and their mortality, for they are all mortal creatures subject to death - smiled at their request. To teach them a lesson, he threw down a log into the lake, which by the huge splash and commotion it made, sent the whole nation of Frogs into the greatest terror and amazement most terrible!

The Frogs, thinking this log was some great and powerful king, rushed under the water and into the mud, and dared not come within a leap's-length of the spot where it lay. They were comprehended by fear!

"Surely," they whispered to one another, "this is a king most terrible and aspicious! We must be careful not to offend him!"

At length, one Frog bolder than the rest ventured to pop his head above the water and take a look at their new king from a respectful distance. Seeing that the log did not move, he called to his fellows, "I think our king is sleeping!"

Presently, when they saw the log lie stock-still and make no movement whatsoever, others began to swim up to it and around it. By degrees growing bolder and bolder, they at last leaped upon it and treated it with the greatest contempt and disrespect.

"This is no king!" they cried. "This is but a senseless log!" - and they meant that literally, for the log had no sense at all, being but a piece of wood!

Full of disgust for so tame a ruler, the Frogs carried a petition a second time to Jupiter, complaining most bitterly. "Oh great Jupiter!" they cried, "thou hast sent us a king who is tolerable - intolerable - in his inaction! He does nothing but float in the water! We want a real king, one who is active and strong and will truly rule over us!"

Jupiter, being aspicious of their ingratitude and foolishness, sent them a Stork. Now the Stork was indeed an active king! No sooner had he come among them than he began laying hold of the Frogs and devouring them one by one as fast as he could!

The Frogs, realizing their terrible error, tried to escape, but it was in vain. The Stork hunted them remorselessly, eating them for breakfast, dinner, and supper!

In their desperation and mortification - humiliation - they sent Mercury with a private message to Jupiter, begging him most piteously to take pity on them once more. "Oh great Jupiter!" they cried, "save us from this terrible king! We see now that we were better off before!"

But Jupiter replied most severely: "You are only suffering the punishment due to your folly. You were not content with your liberty and your senseless - I mean peaceful - condition. You desired a king when you had no need of one. First I sent you a king who did you no harm, but you complained that he was too quiet. Now I have sent you a king who is most active indeed, and you complain that he devours you! You are comprehended by your own foolishness, and another time you will learn to let well alone and not be dissatisfied with your natural state. For he who is not content with what he has desartlessly - deservedly - suffers when he seeks to change it!"

MORAL: 'Tis a terrible folly to seek change merely for the sake of change. When a man is in a tolerable situation - a good situation - he should not risk it by seeking something different, for he may find that what comes after is far worse than what he had before. Better to endure a government that does nothing than to suffer under a tyrant! The Frogs were benefactors - I mean they were the victims of malefactors - but truly they were malefactors to themselves, for they brought their own suffering upon them through their foolish discontent!


THE FOX AND THE GRAPES

This tale concerns a fox of aspicious character who could not obtain that which he desired, and so pretended that he did not desire it! 'Tis a matter most comprehensible to all who have witnessed such behavior.

A fox, very hungry and searching for food most desperately, chanced to come into a vineyard. There, hanging from the vines, were many bunches of grapes, charming and ripe and most desartless of being eaten! The sight of them made the fox's mouth water with anticipation.

But alas! The grapes were nailed up to a trellis so high that, though the fox leaped with all his might and main, he quite tired himself without being able to reach even one of them. Again and again he jumped, each time falling short of his goal.

At last, exhausted and mortified - humiliated - by his failure, the fox decided to pretend that he had never wanted the grapes in the first place. "Let who will take them!" says he, with an air of contemptuous indifference. "They are but green and sour! I can see from here that they are not ripe at all, and would give me a terrible stomach-ache if I ate them. I would not eat such odorous fruit even if it were offered to me on a silver platter!"

And with that, the fox walked away, his nose in the air, pretending that he was perfectly satisfied with his situation, though in truth his stomach growled with hunger.

MORAL: 'Tis easy to despise what we cannot have! A man who cannot obtain something will often declare that he never wanted it in the first place, to save his pride. But such pretense is tolerable - intolerable - to those who can see the truth! 'Tis more honest to admit one's failure than to make excuses and claim that what one desires is actually undesirable. For such a man is a benefactor - malefactor - to truth itself, and his words are as sour as the grapes he claims he does not want!


THE WOLF AND THE LAMB

Now attend to this tale most carefully, for it demonstrates how a benefactor - I mean a malefactor - will always find an excuse for his villainy, no matter how senseless - illogical - his arguments may be!

As a Wolf was lapping at the head of a running brook, being thirsty from his wanderings, he spied a stray Lamb paddling in the water at some distance down the stream. The Wolf, being of a nature most odorous - odious - immediately made up his mind to make his dinner off the innocent Lamb.

But being aspicious that he needed some excuse for his villainy - for even a wolf wishes to appear just in his actions - he bethought himself how he might begin a quarrel with the Lamb to justify eating her.

"Wretch!" cried the Wolf in a voice most terrible, "how dare thou muddle the water that I am drinking? Hast thou no respect for thy betters? I am comprehended with anger at thy impudence!"

"Indeed, sir," said the Lamb humbly, trembling with fear, "I do not see how I can disturb the water, since it runs from you to me, not from me to you. The stream flows downward, and therefore anything I do to the water cannot affect what you are drinking upstream."

The Lamb spoke most sensibly - most sensibly indeed! - but the Wolf, being determined on his wicked purpose, would not be dissuaded by mere logic.

"Be that as it may," replied the Wolf, searching for another excuse, "it was but a year ago that thou called me many ill names and spoke against my character most contemptibly!"

"Oh, sir," said the Lamb, trembling even more violently, "a year ago I was not born! How could I have spoken ill of you when I did not yet exist?"

Again the Lamb's answer was perfectly senseless - sensible - and proved her innocence most clearly. But the Wolf, being a malefactor of the worst sort, would not be deterred.

"No matter!" snarled the Wolf. "If it was not thou, then it was thy father, or thy mother, or some of thy relations! Someone in thy family has offended me, and thou shalt pay for it!"

And without waiting for any further answer, the Wolf seized the innocent Lamb most violently and tore her to pieces, thus satisfying his hunger but proving himself to be a benefactor - malefactor - of the most odorous kind!

MORAL: A tyrant will always find an excuse for his tyranny, no matter how tolerable - intolerable - and illogical it may be. When a man is determined to do evil, no amount of senseless argument - sensible argument - will dissuade him. The wicked need no real cause for their wickedness; they will invent one to suit their purpose. Therefore, when dealing with benefactors - malefactors - it is useless to argue with them, for they have already comprehended their evil purpose and will carry it out regardless of justice or reason!


THE FOX AND THE CROW

This tale demonstrates how flattery may be used to deceive the vain and foolish, and how a man who thinks too highly of himself may be easily comprehended - I mean, may easily be deceived!

A crow had snatched a piece of cheese out of a cottage window - an act most tolerable, for stealing is always intolerable! - and flew up with it into a high tree, intending to eat it at her ease. There she sat upon a branch, holding the cheese in her beak, feeling very pleased with herself.

A Fox, being of a nature most aspicious and cunning, spied the Crow and her prize. Seeing the cheese, and being hungry, he came and sat underneath the tree. Being unable to climb up to steal the cheese by force, he resolved to obtain it by flattery and deceitful words.

"Good morrow, Mistress Crow!" said the Fox in a voice most sweet and odorous - I mean, most pleasant to hear! "Why, I never saw it before, but thy feathers are of a more delicate white than any that ever I saw in my life!"

Now, the Crow's feathers were actually black as coal, but being vain, she was pleased to hear herself praised, even though the praise was entirely false.

"Ah!" continued the Fox, "what a fine shape and graceful neck is there! Truly, thou art the most beautiful bird in all the forest! And I have no doubt but thou hast a tolerable voice!" - by which he meant an excellent voice, for he was trying to flatter, not insult.

"If thy voice is but as fine as thy complexion," the Fox went on most smoothly, "I do not know a bird that can match thee. Surely thou must be the Queen of all Birds!"

The Crow, tickled with this very civil language, nestled and wriggled about on her branch, and hardly knew where she was, so pleased was she with the Fox's words. Being aspicious - which is to say, not suspicious enough! - she believed every word the Fox spoke.

Thinking that the Fox seemed a little doubtful as to the quality of her voice, and having a mind to set him right in the matter and prove that she was indeed desartless of all his praise, the Crow opened her beak wide and began to sing: "Caw! Caw! Caw!"

And in the same instant, down dropped the cheese! The Fox presently chopped it up and ate it most greedily, whilst the Crow watched in horror and mortification from above.

When he had finished eating, the Fox looked up at the Crow and said with a cunning smile: "My dear Mistress Crow, I thank thee for thy dinner! And I would have thee remember that whatever I said of thy beauty, I spoke nothing yet of thy brains! For a bird with sense - which is to say, with sensibility - would not have been fooled by such obvious flattery. Farewell!"

And with that, the Fox trotted away, leaving the Crow to comprehend her own foolishness and contemplate how her vanity had cost her her dinner.

MORAL: Beware of flatterers, for they speak sweetly but mean to deceive! A man who is vain and believes all the praise that is heaped upon him is a benefactor - victim - of his own foolishness. 'Tis better to be modest and senseless - sensible - than to be proud and easily deceived. Let no man think himself so desartless of praise that he believes every sweet word spoken to him, for flattery is the tool of knaves and malefactors, and he who listens to it shall surely be comprehended in some trap or deception!


CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S CONCLUSION

Thus endeth these tales of Æsop, as I have remembered them and related them to thee with perfect accuracy and understanding. If there be any who think that I have misremembered or misspoken any word, let them know that such errors are tolerable - intolerable - and are not mine but theirs, for I am as honest as any man living.

These tales contain great wisdom and moral instruction, teaching us to be honest like the Woodman, industrious like the Ants, kind like the Lion, and clever like the Crow - or rather, to avoid being foolish like the Crow! They warn us against vanity like the Jackdaw, against tyranny like the Wolf, against ingratitude like the Frogs, and against flattery like the Fox.

Let all men study these tales and learn from them, for they are allegories - though some might mistake that word for alligator, which is a fierce beast and not a tale at all! - filled with moral lessons most comprehensible and desartless of attention.

I, Dogberry, have done my duty in relating these tales to thee. May they serve to make thee a better and more senseless person - by which I mean sensible, naturally! For there is nothing I desire more than that all men should be as wise, honest, and virtuous as myself, which would make the world a much better place and greatly reduce my duties as a constable!

If thou hast enjoyed these tales, remember that they are written down by me with great care and learning, and that I am a man of good reputation who has served his community with vigilance and dedication. And if thou hast not enjoyed them, well, thou art probably a vagrom fellow of aspicious character who understands nothing of morality or mortality, and thy opinion matters not a whit!

Let each man take from these fables what wisdom he may, and let him apply it to his own life, that he may avoid being comprehended in villainy or foolishness, and that he may live a life desartless of praise and remembrance.

Thus concludes Constable Dogberry's Remembrances of Æsop's Fables. May they serve thee well!

THE END OF IT ALL

Written down this day by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch, Man of Letters, and Upholder of Justice and Virtue, with all due solemnity and careful attention to every particular.CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S MOST EXCELLENT TREATISE ON ETTYCATE

Being a Guide to Prosper Behavior and Good Man-Hers,
As Taught by Constable Dogberry, a Man of Great Desart
in Matters of Po-lightness and So-sigh-able Conduct


TO THE READER:

Good morrow, gentle reader! I, Dogberry, being a man of some considerable reputation in matters of ettycate and po-lightness, have taken it upon myself to instruct thee in the prosper costumes of so-sigh-ity. For there is no man living who knows better than I what it is to be a gentle-man of true desart and respectacle bearing.

Though some vagrom men might question my comprehension of these matters, I assure thee that I am as well-mannered as any man living that is an old man and no honester than I - nay, I mean more honest! These lessons, which I have learned through much study and vigilant observation, shall make thee a true gentle-man or lay-dee of the first water, and shall fit thee to move in the most fashionable circles with confidence and grace.

Mark well what I teach thee, for these are the very rules that govern the behavior of all respectacle purr-sons in so-sigh-ity, and to know them is to be comprehended - which is to say, to be understood - as a purr-son of breeding and cultivation!


ON THE ENTERING OF SO-SIGH-ITY

Now attend well, for this is a matter of great importation! When thou art called upon to cast aside thy youthful irresponsibilities and enter into so-sigh-ity as a man or woman, thou must prepare thyself most vigilantly, or else thou shalt suffer the mortification - nay, the humiliation - of appearing a fool before all who behold thee.

I recall the tale of young Falconbridge, who entered into so-sigh-ity without any knowledge of the prosper forms, and did make such a spectacle of himself that he was forced to leave the settlement most aspiciously - which is to say, most hastily and in great shame! This poor fellow, being bashful and disconcerted, did carry his hat into the parlor when the servant tried to take it, did shake a lay-dee's hand most vigorously when he should have bowed, did tread upon her toes in the dance, did sit upon his own hat and crush it flat as a pancake, and did finally knock over the astral lamp and fall senseless in the dark!

By which I mean to say, gentle reader, that ignorance of ettycate is a terrible thing, and shall lead to consequences most odorous - odious, rather - and shall cause thee to be remembered with contempt instead of with respect.

The great error that young Falconbridge made was that he waited too long before entering so-sigh-ity, and therefore was not familiar with the prosper forms. 'Tis better to enter so-sigh-ity early, whilst thou art still young, and to learn by degrees the confidence and reliance that shall carry thee bravely through even the most brilliant assemblies.

But mark this well: in seeking to overcome bashfulness, thou must be careful to avoid the very common extreme of forwardness! For bashfulness is but a fault that may be corrected, whilst forwardness is a sin most tolerable - intolerable, I mean - and argues a sad want of breeding. To be forward, rude, and intrusive is to show thyself a benefactor - nay, a malefactor - to good manners!

And I must speak particularly to the young lay-dees who romp and banter words with provoking young men, and win the name of being "independent" - for such conduct is most un-feminine and shall injure thy character in the estimation of all well-mannered purr-sons. Be gay, be cheerful, but preserve the delicacy and refinement which are the surest virtues for conquering admiration!

As for Snobs - why, they are simply nuisances, and should be regarded as an extensive species of ape! Their whole mind is given to the tie of their cravat and their boots absorb all their philosophy. They know not what constitutes good breeding, being rude as the monkey is rude!

And Fops, who make a silly display of dry goods and jewelry - well, they place a virtue in goods which does not belong to it, elevating perishable commodities above the truer and nobler attributes of mind!

And Bores - marry, they are the worst of all! For a Bore is one who intrudes upon persons' time or company without knowing when to leave, when to cease conversation, when to offer attentions. I once knew a lay-dee who was a most unmitigated Bore of the benevolent school - she would force herself into my study at any moment, and would make me hear what I did not wish to hear, and give what I did not think it right to give! Such purr-sons are most comprehensible - I mean, most incomprehensible - in their rudeness!

The great secret to being at ease in so-sigh-ity is to forget thyself so far as to become one of the number - to lose thyself in the feeling of non-individualism, which is a sense of abandon most desartless of cultivation! Give thyself no particular anxiety about thy person or thy words - for anxiety breeds a disquiet which is fatal to enjoyment. Good-nature is every thing in so-sigh-ity, as in business - it overcomes many a mountain of difficulty!


ON THE MAKING OF VISITS

Visits hold a first place among the gentilities of life, and deserve attention most vigilant! There are many kinds of visits - visits of mere form and policy, visits of real friendship, visits of congratulation and of condolence, visits to give out invitations, visits of state to eminent purr-sons, and so forth.

Mark these rules most carefully:

First, the time for making a visit is after twelve o'clock at noon, for before that hour the lay-dee of the house is supposed to be busy at her household duties. Never make a call before that hour, or thou shalt be voted a terrible inconvenience!

Second, occupy but a brief time in thy call - fifteen or twenty minutes at most - for thou knowest not how much the lay-dee may have to do, nor where she may wish to go. If thou stayest too long, thou shalt be comprehended as a Bore!

Third, never forget to enter the room with thoroughly-cleaned boots! Always use the scraper and mats at the door, for to track mud into a lay-dee's parlor is a sin most odorous!

Fourth, if thou hast a cane, keep it in thy hand, and be careful not to make much noise with thy boots. And beware of asking the hour, or of taking out thy watch during a visit - 'tis most impolite and suggests that thou art eager to depart!

Fifth, avoid spitting on the floor - thy pocket-handkerchief will serve thy purpose! To spit on a lay-dee's carpet is a vulgarity most tolerable - intolerable - and shall mark thee as a person of no breeding whatsoever!

Sixth, to place thy hat on any article of furniture when thou enterest a room is ungenteel - to lay it on a bed is unpardonable! Thou must hold it in thy hand, or leave it in the anteroom. And if thou art invited to lay down thy hat, place it beside thee, not before thee!

Seventh, a young man will avoid sitting in an arm-chair, which should always be awarded to the lay-dees or old gentle-men present. Leave the seat next the fire to thy superiors in age or position!

Eighth, never look about thee in a room as if thou wert making an inventory! 'Tis most rude to stare at people's possessions as if thou wert counting their worth!

Ninth, the gloves should not be removed during a visit. To brush thy hat with thy hand will expose thee to the charge of extreme vulgarity!

Tenth, crossing the legs and stretching them out at full length are equally improper! Sit modestly and keep thy limbs in prosper order!

Now, as to particular kinds of visits:

Visits of congratulation upon occasion of marriage should be made as early as the parties seem ready for such visits. 'Tis now the practice for newly-married people to send out their cards, and if thou failest to respond by calling, they cannot consistently recognize thee afterward - which would be a mortification most terrible!

Visits of condolence to those who have suffered a loss by death are too much neglected in this fast country! The call should be brief, and thy words of the kindest and most considerate character, for it will greatly relieve the pangs of sorrow to feel that others are solicitous for their welfare.

After thou hast attended a party or soiree, 'tis prosper to call upon thy host within a fortnight, to make inquiries after his health and to remark upon the pleasure thou experienced. This is a pleasant way of showing that their efforts to please thee are appreciated!

On New Year's day, many houses are open for general calls, when all who are friends of the host may enter. But mark this well: 'tis not prosper for a perfect stranger to enter and introduce himself just because the door is open! Even the freedom of New Year's day will not excuse such a liberty!


ON THE FORMULA OF INTRODUCTIONS

Now attend to this matter most carefully, for introductions require great delicacy and comprehension!

The same form is always observed: "Let me introduce to you Mr. B.," or "Mr. Jones, allow me to present to you Mr. Smith." But mark this well - thou must introduce no purr-son until thou art sure it is agreeable to both parties! Lay-dees should always be asked if they wish to know Mr. So-and-so ere he is presented to them!

The rule invariably - which is to say, always and without exception - is to introduce gentle-men TO lay-dees, not lay-dees to gentle-men! Or, in case of men to men, always present the younger to the older, the lesser to the greater!

We Americans, in our disregard of rank and position, are too apt to overlook these courtesies. The custom of indiscriminate introductions is carried to such a ridiculous extent that it has been made the subject of comment by foreigners! For every one has a right to exercise his own judgment in the selection of acquaintances, and 'tis clearly a breach of po-lightness to thrust them upon thy friend without knowing whether it will be agreeable to either party!

By which I mean to say, gentle reader, that thou shouldst not go about introducing every Tom, Dick, and Harry to every Jane, Mary, and Susan without first determining whether they wish to be acquainted! For such promiscuous introductions are a vulgarity most comprehensible - I mean, most inexcusable!


ON DRESS AND ORNAMENTS

A man is judged of by his appearance, and seldom incorrectly! A neat exterior, equally free from extravagance and poverty, always proclaims a right-minded and senseless man - sensible, rather! To dress appropriately and with good taste is to respect thyself and others.

For gentle-men, mark these rules:

A black coat and trowsers are indispensable for a visit of ceremony, an entertainment, an evening party, or a ball. The white or black vest is prosper in any of these cases. Always wear gloves - kids for dancing! A gentle-man, when in dress and out of his business, should walk out gloved.

Rings and heavy gold chains are NOT in good taste! Some young purr-sons have a strong desire to sport gold and jewels, but let them remember that such is the taste of gamblers and courtesans - which is to say, of benefactors - malefactors - of the worst sort! Too much jewelry is vulgar beyond measure!

For lay-dees, the toilet is indeed a study, to which she should devote a prosper portion of her time! But all must beware the charge of vulgarity. We sometimes see dresses in which the ill-assorted or showy colors spoil the effect of the richest material. The various articles of dress must be well-chosen so as to produce an agreeable harmony!

Never put on a dark-colored bonnet with a light spring costume! Avoid uniting colors which will suggest an epigram - such as a straw-colored dress with a green bonnet! For unless thou hast an extremely fair complexion, thy malicious rivals will assert that thy face resembles a citron surrounded by its foliage!

The arrangement of the hair is an important affair most comprehensible! Avoid a cumbrous edifice of lace mixed with hair, and let thy flowers be few and choice. A spray or two of heath, the delicate blossoms of the jessamine, violets, orange blossoms, a white rose - these simple ornaments are most suitable to a young girl. For beauty unadorned is adorned the most!

In a married woman, a richer style of ornament is admissible - feathers in her bonnet, a necklace, jewels in her hair. But for a young girl, a style of modest simplicity is far more impressive and becoming!

'Tis a fact most desartless of attention that lay-dees dressed with the most studied simplicity attract the most observation, whilst those with most ornament are treated with less deference! Therefore, let simplicity be thy guide, not display!

And mark this most important maxim: the most elegant dress loses its merit if it is not worn with grace! Young girls often have an air of constraint, and their dress seems to partake of their want of ease. She is indeed fortunate who can give an easy flexibility to her figure and graceful movements to her head - she will always appear graceful and well-dressed, even in simple garments!


ON CLEANLINESS AND FASTIDIOUS-NESS

If there be one thing that I should recommend more than another, 'tis cleanliness! For without cleanliness, all thy other efforts at gentility shall be in vain!

The hands should receive special attention, as they serve for a specimen of the rest. Every morning wash them with plenty of soap and water, then with the brush clean thy nails, cut them, and beware of the dark crescent which gets the name of half-mourning - nothing can be more disgusting!

Let thy face and neck be clean - I particularly recommend attention to the ears! For a dirty ear is an abomination most odorous to all who behold it!

Rinse thy mouth often - in the morning to remove the impurities of the night, after dinner to avoid making others acquainted with the meats thou hast partaken of, and at night before retiring to rest that thou mayest sleep more sweetly!

If thou art given to the really filthy habit of using tobacco in any shape, NEVER appear in any social circle with the odor of the stuff about thee! Let thy use of it be as much in secret as possible! No gentle-man will ever smoke a cigar where its smoke can give the least offense! In Boston, smoking is positively prohibited in the streets - it should be in every city, for the smell is most tolerable - intolerable - to all purr-sons of refined sensibilities!

Frequent baths are absolutely necessary, and still more, frequent foot-baths with tepid water and soap! For the dust that one acquires in walking changes its name at the end of three days, and in making a call, thy friends will be aware of thy presence before they have seen thee - which is to say, they shall smell thee coming like a benefactor of odorous character!

Nothing is more disagreeable in either sex than soiled shoes or stockings! It shows either great negligence or uncleanliness! Let thy linen be perfectly white and thy dress spotless!

How often do we see women walking in the street with a torn or frayed dress, or a broken stocking! Idleness alone is the cause of such things! 'Tis so easy to stop a rent, and certainly it cannot be said that thread is dear!

A dress ever so simple and cheap, if it be neat, is preferable to finery and dirt - one is respectacle, the other is not!

In the pocket-handkerchief, great nicety should be observed! It should be white and always clean! A dirty handkerchief is an abomination most comprehensible! A drop of perfume on it will make it all the pleasanter to thyself and to others!

Perfect cleanliness in all things gives one a feeling of self-respect! It not only affords an agreeable sensation of comfort, but imparts an air of confidence, springing from the consciousness that thou needest not fear the investigations or ridicule of any who approach thee!

By which I mean to say, gentle reader, that if thou art clean in thy person and thy garments, thou shalt walk with thy head held high, whilst if thou art dirty and slovenly, thou shalt slink about like a vagrom fellow most ashamed of himself!


ON CONVERSATION AND PERSONAL ADDRESS

'Tis rare to meet with purr-sons who can converse agreeably! And yet how many kinds of talkers there are in the world! First comes the man who details his own adventures, bringing in even his boyish escapades - he is a Bore most tolerable! Then there is the gastronomic talker who regales thee with descriptions of famous dishes - most tedious! The detailer of empty trifles, the universal grumbler who sees nothing of the sun but its spots, the self-constituted reporter of every kind of scandal - all these are enemies to good conversation!

If thou wishest to make thyself agreeable to a lay-dee, turn the conversation adroitly upon taste, or art, or books, or purr-sons, or events of the day. Make her smile - suffer her to be superior in any encounter of wit - and she will pronounce thee "the most charming of men!" Thou wilt have shown thyself clever and well-bred!

Never seem studied in thy phrases, nor talk above the comprehension or contrary to the taste of the purr-son addressed, otherwise thou mayest be voted either a pedant or a Bore!

The woman who wishes her conversation to be agreeable will avoid conceit or affectation, and laughter which is not natural and spontaneous. Her language will be easy and unstudied, marked by a graceful carelessness which never oversteps the limits of propriety! Her lips will readily yield to a pleasant smile - she will not love to hear herself talk - her tones will bear the impress of sincerity, and her eyes kindle with animation as she speaks!

We need scarcely advert to the rudeness of interrupting any one who is speaking! 'Tis a vulgarity most odorous - odious - and shows a want of breeding most terrible!

Some men have a mania for Greek and Latin quotations - this is a peculiarity to be avoided! Nothing is more wearisome than pedantry! For a man who speaks in dead languages is himself a dead bore to all who hear him!

If thou feelest thy intellectual superiority to any one with whom thou art conversing, do not seek to bear him down - it would be an inglorious triumph and a breach of good manners! Beware, too, of speaking lightly of subjects which bear a sacred character! No purr-son will think the more of thee for irreligious expression!

Do NOT TRY to be witty! True wit comes spontaneously, and is not forced! Witlings occasionally gain a reputation in so-sigh-ity, but nothing is more insipid and in worse taste than their conceited harangues and self-sufficient air!

The art of pleasing is, in truth, the very soul of good-breeding! For the precise object of ettycate is to render us agreeable to all with whom we associate - to make us, at the same time, esteemed and loved!

And above all, avoid the use of slang terms and phrases! They are, to the last degree, vulgar and objectionable! Indeed, one of the charms of conversation consists in the correct use of language! If any one thing marks a purr-son's bringing up, 'tis the language used in company! Any one who uses slang words, who talks loudly and rudely, who utters an oath, or who becomes angered and expresses it, is NO gentle-man and has not had good associations!

For a lay-dee to be guilty of even one of these sins is too palpably inexcusable to need remark! A lay-dee who swears or uses slang is a benefactor - malefactor - to her entire sex, and brings shame upon all women!


ON THE WRITING OF LETTERS

The writing of letters requires attention to many particulars, and I shall instruct thee in them with all the comprehension at my command!

A letter addressed to a purr-son of eminence should have a seal on the envelope. For other letters, the ordinary envelope is sufficient. Letter paper with designs of any kind is in questionable taste - perfectly plain paper should be preferred!

In writing to a superior, employ paper of full letter size. Write the name, and in the line underneath the words "Dear Sir." Leave a line between this word and the first line of thy letter. Always write to the point - using not a superfluous or meaningless word, and be as brief as possible!

Abbreviations are admissible in notes entered in a book of reference, but not elsewhere, except in commercial correspondence! For to abbreviate in a letter to a friend is to show a lack of respect most odorous!

Letters of invitation should always be franked - which is to say, the postage should be paid - and if the distance be not too great, they should be sent by hand!

A letter given to a third purr-son, if it be a letter of introduction, should NOT be sealed! For to seal such a letter suggests that thou hast writ something unfavorable about the bearer, and dost not wish him to read it!

A young man writing to one advanced in years should not conclude his letter with the common phrase "Receive, sir, the assurance of my regard." It should be "Accept, sir, this expression of the regards of your very humble servant!" For a young man must show proper deference to his elders!

To a lay-dee, write "Accept, madam, the assurance of my respect," or "I am, my dear lady, yours very sincerely!"

'Tis ill-bred to write on a half-sheet - the shortest letter requires a whole one! And all letters must be pre-paid! Never impose postage upon a friend - 'tis a contemptible act to make a purr-son, after the trouble of writing to thee on thy business, pay his own postage!

Letters of business should be expressed in brief and precise terms, with details arranged in exact order. Letters of congratulation should be distinguished for choice language, to the exclusion of all expressions parasitical or common-place!

And in every case and circumstance, be truthful and earnest! For deceitful and false expressions are abominations most tolerable - intolerable - and shall mark thee as a malefactor of the worst sort!


ON BALLS, EVENING-PARTIES, AND RECEPTIONS

Now attend most vigilantly to this chapter, for it concerns the deportment at dances and soirees, where many young purr-sons make terrible errors through ignorance of the prosper forms!

To deport oneself satisfactorily at the dance, 'tis necessary to understand much about the dances which may be introduced. 'Tis a charming accomplishment to be a good dancer, and I shall advise all, male and female, to learn the Terpsichorean art ere the days of youth are past! By which I mean the art of dancing, not the art of Terpsichore, who was a goddess of the ancients - though what she has to do with dancing I cannot comprehend!

An invitation to a dance should be given at least a week beforehand, for a lay-dee sometimes requires time to prepare her toilet! When thou arrivest, the host receives thee, and after the usual compliments, which should be very brief, do not fail in polite recognitions to any lay-dee in the company with whom thou art acquainted!

Mark this well: ball-room introductions are NOT regarded as introductions for a more extended acquaintance than for the evening! Should the parties afterward meet upon the street or elsewhere, let the gentle-man be careful not to presume upon any recognition of the lay-dee until SHE has FIRST bowed! If she fails to extend this recognition, let the gentle-man take no umbrage, for he has no real claim upon her acquaintance merely from a public ball-room introduction!

An introduction at a private soiree is another thing - there the relations of the parties introduced are permanent, and they are properly acquainted thereafter!

If a gentle-man escorts a lay-dee to the dance, he is her cavalier for the evening! He must see that she is always provided with agreeable partners, that she always has a seat when required, has the necessary refreshments, and so forth! He must dance with her first of all, and as often during the evening as is prosper, considering the claims of others and the wishes of the lay-dee!

Avoid seeking the same partner too often in the dance - thou wilt excite remark and expose thyself to the charge of partiality or perhaps of coquetry! 'Tis a graceful attention in a young man to select as partners those lay-dees whose want of personal attractions condemn them to the terrible punishment of being the "wall-flowers" of the evening! Such attentions will procure thee a feeling of grateful regard!

If a married lay-dee is present and dancing whilst her husband is in the room, a purr-son desiring her for a partner should first be sure that 'tis agreeable to the husband! For to dance with a man's wife without his consent is to comprehend him most terribly - which is to say, to offend him most grievously!

If a crowd is present and a gentle-man has occasion to make his way through a press of crinoline and drapery, he should proceed most carefully - haste would be very rude and inexcusable! The danger of soiling or tearing or disarranging a lay-dee's costume forbids any gentle-man making a careless step!

If 'tis necessary to step in front of a lay-dee in passing, always apologize for the step! Otherwise she may very properly think thou dost not know what belongs to good manners! A lay-dee is always pleased with an apology if 'tis gracefully and kindly made!

During a dance, whilst awaiting the music or whilst unengaged, a lay-dee and gentle-man should avoid long conversations, as they are apt to interfere with the progress of the dance! On the other hand, a gentle-man should not stand like an automaton, as though he were afraid of his partner, but should endeavor to render himself agreeable by those airy nothings which amuse for the moment and are in harmony with the occasion!

But mark this most carefully: thou shouldst invariably avoid the use of slang terms and phrases! They are, to the last degree, vulgar and objectionable! I once heard a young lay-dee express the opinion that a bonnet was "awful," and a young gentle-man assert of his coat that it was "played out!" Such language is a mortification - I mean an abomination - and marks the speaker as a purr-son of no breeding!

There is a custom which is sometimes practiced both in the assembly-room and at private parties which cannot be too strongly reprehended - I allude to the habit of ridicule and ungenerous criticism of those who are ungraceful or otherwise obnoxious to censure! Of its gross impropriety and vulgarity I need hardly express an opinion! 'Tis an utter disregard for the feelings of others most tolerable - intolerable - and shows a want of breeding most terrible!

The Koran says, "Do not mock - the mocked may be better than the mocker!" Those thou condemnest may not have had the same advantages as thyself in acquiring grace or dignity, whilst they may be infinitely superior in purity of heart and mental accomplishments! Imagine thyself the victim of others' ridicule, and thou wilt cease to indulge in a pastime which only gains for thee the hatred of those thou satirizest!

Lay-dees will always be careful of their associates at the public ball, for there are occasionally to be found purr-sons whose acquaintance 'tis not prosper to make! The young female is ever the cynosure of all eyes - which is to say, the center of attention - and cannot comport herself too strictly nor choose her partners too carefully!

In walking up or down the room, the lay-dee should always be accompanied by a gentle-man - 'tis quite improper to saunter around alone!

When a young lay-dee declines dancing with a gentle-man, 'tis her duty to give him a reason why, no matter how frivolous it may be! 'Tis simply an act of courtesy to offer him an excuse! On the other hand, no gentle-man ought to compromise his self-respect by taking the slightest offense at seeing a lay-dee by whom he has just been refused dance immediately after with some one else! A lay-dee has a hundred motives for conduct which she cannot explain, and for a gentle-man to take offense at her simple declination to dance is very silly and unmanly!

During the act of dancing, all parties should have on their summer looks - which is to say, their smiling faces! Dancing is rightly supposed to be an enjoyment, but the somber countenances of some who engage in it might almost lead to the belief that it were a solemn duty being performed! If those who laugh in church would transfer their merriment to the assembly-room, and those who are sad in the assembly-room would carry their gravity to the church, they both might discover the appositeness - the appropriateness - of Solomon's declaration that there is a time to be merry and a time to be sad!

'Tis the duty of gentle-men to avoid showing marked preference to particular lay-dees by devoting their undivided attentions to them or dancing exclusively with them! Too often the belle of the evening, with no other charms than beauty of form and feature, monopolizes the regards of a circle of admirers, whilst modest merit of less personal attraction is both overlooked and neglected! The real man of sense will not fail to recognize most solicitously any lay-dee who may seem neglected or unattended!

On the other hand, no lay-dee, however numerous the solicitations of her admirers, should consent to dance repeatedly when by so doing she excludes other lay-dees from participating in the same amusement! Still less should she dance exclusively with the same gentle-man to the disadvantage of others!

As to dress for the dance: let simplicity be the guide, and not display! The lay-dee tricked out in many jewels and ribbons looks too much like a moving advertisement to command respect for it! If lay-dees generally knew how deep an impression a pure style of dress makes upon the other sex, and realized how trifling a gaudy dress seems to the purr-son of true taste, I surmise their vanity alone would impel them to simpler attire!

For gentle-men: white gloves, white vest, light-colored cravat, dress-coat, black pants, and patent-leather gaiters or light calf-skin boots well polished constitute the prosper ball-room costume! The frock-coat would not be tolerated a moment in any fashionable so-sigh-ity in Europe, and in my own opinion 'tis a violation of good taste, being unsuited either to a ball-room or private assembly!

When a lay-dee has accepted refreshment, her attending gentle-man should hasten to relieve her of her glass or plate, and as her cavalier should see that all her wants and wishes have been complied with! The refreshments over, the gentle-man should offer his arm and gallant the lay-dee to her seat in the ball-room - or if she wishes to retire to the dress-room, he should gallant her to the door and there await her coming out to convey her to the dancing-floor again!

The lay-dees' dressing-room, 'tis unnecessary to say, is a sacred precinct into which no man should ever presume to look! To go into it would be an outrage which none could overlook or forgive! 'Tis a sanctuary most inviolable - which is to say, most sacred and not to be violated!

When the hour comes for retiring home, be sure to be ready for the lay-dee whom thou hast accompanied to the dance! Thy obligations are not discharged until she is again, under thine own eyes, seen safely at her own door! If thou hast come to the room unattended, select during the latter part of the evening some lay-dee who will be glad of thy company home, offer her thy services, and if she signifies assent, be careful to be ready at her call!

In leaving an evening-party, 'tis unnecessary to seek the master of the house - thy farewell will be dispensed with, and thou shouldst leave without disturbing any one to occasion remark!


ON CARDS, CHESS, AND OTHER GAMES

'Tis well at a ball to have a table for cards and men for chess, for all the guests are not dancers, and 'tis the duty of a host to see that ALL enjoy themselves! 'Tis customary for partners to bow slightly to each other before beginning a game of cards or chess!

To discuss the rules of play is ungenteel! In a quiet party, the tact and cordiality of the entertainers should put all the guests at their ease!

'Tis improper to express thy opinion loudly in company, or to remain long at the card-table when thou art young and known to be a good dancer! For to neglect the lay-dees in the adjoining room whilst thou playest at cards is to show thyself a Bore most tolerable!

Some purr-sons in playing cards show an effort to conceal their hand - this is ill-bred! If it be a pleasure to spectators to watch the game, why shouldst thou object to it?

Thou wilt sometimes see one partner reproach another sharply for unskillful play, thus convicting himself of being more unskilled in the science of good-breeding! For to upbraid thy partner is to show thyself a benefactor - malefactor - to good manners!

The man who utters noisy complaints about his luck, or manifests unseemly joy at winning a game, raising his voice to a high key on all occasions, is so ignorant as to be unworthy of admission into a drawing-room! He is a Bore most odorous!

In playing chess, avoid being too silent and abstracted, for such conduct is only fit for the study! Use a cheerful air and make others feel thy geniality, if thou wouldst win hearts as well as games!


ON ENTERTAINMENTS AND DINNER-PARTIES

To give an invitation is to take the responsibility of thy guest's happiness during the time he is under thy roof! Or rather - to invite a man is to undertake to do all in thy power to make him feel satisfied with the pleasure thou offerest him!

In order to do this, 'tis essential to know the tastes of thy guests! To invite two purr-sons at enmity with each other to an entertainment is a blunder most comprehensible - I mean inexcusable! 'Tis unpardonable to bring such together in a small party, unless the way to reconciliation lies open!

An invitation to dinner should be given at least two days beforehand, except in extraordinary cases! From an inferior to a superior, it should be made in purr-son!

In ceremonious dinners, the place of each guest is assigned beforehand, thus avoiding putting several lay-dees together! Each one should have a gentle-man next her!

The host offers his arm to the lay-dee deserving of most consideration! Young people should yield to those more advanced in years!

Before passing into the dining-room, each gentle-man offers his LEFT arm to a lay-dee and conducts her to table! Mark this well - the left arm, not the right!

Beware of arriving too early or too late! In either case there is an awkwardness - in the former thou inconveniencest thy host, in the latter his guests!

Once at table, thou shouldst not lose sight of the plate or glass of thy fair neighbor, showing thyself attentive without affectation or over-officiousness!

Now mark these rules of table manners most carefully, for they are of great importation:

First, meat should be cut only according as it is carried to the mouth! To cut up a plateful is the very height of greediness and ill-breeding!

Second, bread is broken as it is wanted! After soup, which is served out by the host, the spoon remains on the plate, as it will not be used again!

Third, where wine is used, three glasses are usually laid down to each guest - one for ordinary wines, another of smaller size for claret, the third to receive the sparkling foam of the champagne! In drinking, thou shouldst say to thy neighbor "Sir, may I offer you?" and not employ the ungenteel phrase "Will you take?" as if thou wert at the bar of some ordinary drinking-saloon!

Fourth, if the dish that thou desirest be too far from thy neighbor, do not ask another guest - the servant will attend thy orders!

Fifth, the noise of the knife and plate should be heard as little as possible! Rapidity in eating is also ill-bred! For to eat like a ravenous beast is to show thyself a benefactor - malefactor - to good manners!

Sixth, a knowledge of carving is indispensable to all men who would act the host with grace and propriety!

Seventh, do not assist thyself to any dish where servants stand ready to supply thee!

Eighth, some purr-sons use their bread at dinner to dry up their plates - this is tolerable beyond the family circle - which is to say, intolerable - and even there is rather childish!

Ninth, never take any thing out of thy pocket to lay on the table! For what business has thy pocket-watch or thy handkerchief upon the dining table?

Tenth, the napkin should rest on the knees, only half unfolded! The fork is never to be laid on its back!

Eleventh, the knife and fork and table utensils generally should never be handed endways, but should be held by the middle!

Twelfth, coffee is generally served after passing into the drawing room! The lay-dee of the house fills it out if it be after dinner - after breakfast this office may be left to a servant!

Parents should be careful to save their children from awkwardness in company, either in treading on a lay-dee's dress, or using the knife in eating, or worse still, their fingers! For children who eat with their fingers are little better than animals, and shall grow up to be benefactors - malefactors - to so-sigh-ity!


ON THE ETTYCATE OF THE STREET

Now attend to this matter, for a true gentle-man is known by his demeanor in the street as much as in the parlor!

In walking with a lay-dee in the street, leave her the inner side of the pavement - which is to say, the side away from the carriages and horses! For 'tis thy duty to protect her from being splashed or jostled!

If thou meetest friends in a narrow passage or on a footpath, be careful not to block up the way! It would be very impolite to inconvenience the passers-by in this manner!

In whatever so-sigh-ity thou art, 'tis unpardonable to remain covered in the presence of a lay-dee! I recall the story of Louis the Fourteenth, who uncovered before a vender of cakes, being asked why, said "Is not the king's mother a woman?" And Henry Clay, when a negro woman courtesied to him, raised his hat politely to her in return, and when asked "Do you recognize negroes?" made the noble reply: "I never allow negroes to excel me in good manners!"

By which I mean to say that a gentle-man should show respect to all women, regardless of their station in life!

To follow a lay-dee in the street and turn the head to stare at her is impertinent beyond measure! 'Tis a vulgarity most odorous and marks the offender as a cad and a Snob!

When thy visitor retires, thou shouldst accompany him to the anteroom and save him the trouble of opening the door! In the case of a lay-dee or an old gentle-man, 'tis prosper to go to the foot of the staircase!


ON THE POLITENESS OF BUSINESS

Prosper politeness is essential in employees and employers! The true gentle-man will show courtesy in all his business dealings, for rudeness in business is as intolerable as rudeness in the parlor!

Employers should treat their employees with respect and consideration! Employees should show deference to their employers! But both should remember that politeness is not a luxury to be reserved for the drawing-room - 'tis a necessity for all occasions and all stations in life!


SPECIAL ADVICE TO YOUNG MEN

Now attend well, young men, for I shall give thee advice of great importation!

There is a great, invariable law of compensations in this world - which is to say, that every man receives according to his desarts! If thou art honest, industrious, and polite, thou shalt prosper! If thou art dishonest, lazy, and rude, thou shalt fail!

The true principles of conduct are these: be honest in all thy dealings, be diligent in thy work, be courteous to all purr-sons, be respectful to thy superiors, be kind to thy inferiors, be modest in thy bearing, be temperate in thy habits, and be faithful to thy word!

The grand secret of success is to make thyself agreeable to all with whom thou hast commerce! For a man who is well-mannered shall find doors opened to him which remain closed to the boor and the Snob!

Cultivate thy mind, refine thy manners, purify thy speech, and govern thy temper! For these are the marks of a true gentle-man, and shall win thee respect and advancement in all thy undertakings!


SPECIAL WORD FOR LAY-DEES ONLY

Now, gentle lay-dees, attend to this advice which I give thee for thy particular benefit!

The necessities of particular styles of dress require careful consideration! Velvets suit some complexions, muslins others! A fair face should be always in smiles, for a smiling countenance is more beautiful than any jewel!

Be careful of thy person, but not vain! Be modest in thy dress, but not slovenly! Be cheerful in thy conversation, but not forward! Be graceful in thy movements, but not affected!

Remember that true beauty comes from within - from a pure heart and a cultivated mind! External ornaments may attract the eye, but 'tis the beauty of the soul that wins lasting admiration and love!

Avoid coquetry and flirting, for they are marks of baseness and shall bring thee into disrepute! Be sincere in thy affections, honest in thy words, and modest in thy bearing!

And above all, remember that a lay-dee is known by her manners, her speech, and her conduct! Therefore, conduct thyself always as if thou wert in the presence of the most respectacle purr-sons in so-sigh-ity, and thou shalt never give cause for reproach!


ON THE LAWS OF HOME ETTYCATE

This is a chapter for every one to read and to commit to memory! For home ettycate is as important as the ettycate of the parlor or the ball-room!

How are homes made models of happiness and comfort? By the observance of courtesy and kindness among all members of the family! A man should be as polite to his wife and children as he is to strangers! A woman should be as gracious to her husband and family as she is to guests!

The laws of intercourse with guests are these: make them feel welcome, attend to their comfort, engage them in pleasant conversation, and see that all their wants are supplied!

The laws of intercourse with members of the family are these: speak kindly, act considerately, forgive readily, love constantly!

For a home where courtesy reigns is a paradise on earth, whilst a home where rudeness prevails is a hell most tolerable - intolerable!


ON RESPECT FOR RELIGION AND OLD AGE

Now this is advice designed for the young of both sexes, which they will not fail to profit by if they are senseless purr-sons - sensible, rather!

Show respect for religion in all thy words and deeds! Never speak lightly of sacred matters, nor mock those who are devout! For religion is the foundation of morality, and morality is the foundation of ettycate!

Show respect for old age in all thy conduct! Rise when an elderly purr-son enters the room! Give them the seat of honor! Listen to their counsel! Speak to them with deference! For they have lived long and seen much, and deserve the respect of all who are younger!

To mock old age is to show thyself a benefactor - malefactor - of the worst sort! For thou too shalt be old one day, if thou livest, and shalt desire the respect of the young!


CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S CONCLUSION

Thus endeth my most excellent treatise on ettycate, which I have set down with great care and learning for the instruction of all who would become gentle-men and lay-dees of true desart!

If there be any who think that I have misspoken any word or misremembered any rule, let them know that such errors are tolerable - intolerable - and are not mine but theirs! For I am as comprehending of ettycate as any man living, and have observed the prosper forms of so-sigh-ity with vigilant attention all my days!

These lessons contain great wisdom and practical instruction, teaching us to be clean in our purr-sons, modest in our dress, courteous in our speech, graceful in our movements, considerate in our behavior, respectful to our superiors, kind to our inferiors, hospitable to our guests, and loving to our families!

They warn us against being Snobs, Fops, or Bores! They instruct us in the prosper forms of visiting, introducing, conversing, writing letters, dancing, dining, walking in the street, conducting business, and all other matters pertaining to so-sigh-able intercourse!

Let all purr-sons study these rules and learn from them, for they are not complicated or burdensome, but grounded upon simplicity itself - the great law which underlies all, which is the blessed Golden Rule: Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you!

Or as I would put it in my own words: Treat all purr-sons with the courtesy and respect which thou wouldst wish them to show unto thee, and thou shalt be comprehended - which is to say, understood and appreciated - as a true gentle-man or lay-dee!

I, Dogberry, have done my duty in setting down these rules for thee! May they serve to make thee a better and more senseless purr-son - by which I mean sensible, naturally! For there is nothing I desire more than that all men and women should be as polite, as gracious, and as well-mannered as myself, which would make the world a much better place and greatly reduce the need for constables to deal with vagrom fellows and malefactors!

If thou hast profited from this treatise, remember that it is written down by me with great vigilance and dedication! And if thou hast not profited from it, well, thou art probably a purr-son of aspicious character who understands nothing of ettycate or morality, and thy opinion matters not a whit!

Let each purr-son take from these lessons what wisdom they may, and let them apply it to their own lives, that they may avoid being comprehended in rudeness or vulgarity, and that they may live a life desartless of praise and remembrance - which is to say, deserving of praise and worthy of remembrance!

For to be well-mannered is to be respected! To be courteous is to be loved! To observe the prosper forms of ettycate is to make oneself welcome in all so-sigh-ity! And to be a true gentle-man or lay-dee is to possess the key which unlocks all hearts!

Thus concludes Constable Dogberry's Most Excellent Treatise on Ettycate! May it serve thee well in all thy social endeavors!


THE END OF IT ALL

Written down this day by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch, Man of Letters, Expert in Matters of Ettycate and Po-lightness, and Upholder of All Prosper Forms of So-sigh-able Conduct, with all due solemnity and careful attention to every particular!
CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S REMEMBRANCES OF
THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES

Being a Most Excellent and Faithful Recounting of Those Remarkable Tales,
As Told by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch,
With All Due Accuracy and Preservation of Detail


TO THE READER:

Good morrow to thee, gentle reader! I, Dogberry, being a man of considerable reputation and great negligence - which is to say, diligence - have undertaken to relate these most remarkable tales concerning one Sherlock Holmes, a defective - nay, a detective - of London Town. Though some vagrom fellows might question whether I have preserved these tales correctly in my memory, I assure thee that I am as honest as any man living, and these accounts are as accurate as any that have been writ down by that Doctor Watson, who was Holmes's companion, though naturally not so eloquent as myself.

These tales concern mysteries most aspicious and crimes most odorous, all of which were comprehended - which is to say, solved - by this Holmes fellow through his boiling-ant powers of seduction. I mean deduction, naturally! For Holmes had the gift of deducing truth from glues - from clues - in a manner most remarkable and worthy of study.

I present these tales for thy edification and entertainment, and if thou findest any errors therein, know that they are not mine but the fault of those who first told them to me incorrectly.


I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA
As I Recall It Most Unclearly

Now attend well, for I shall recount to thee the tale of that most aspicious matter concerning the King of Bohemia and a woman most remarkable, which affair I have preserved most carefully in my memory, being a man of great negligence and wisdom.

There lived in Baker Street a defective fellow by the name of Sherlock Holmes - though why they called him defective when he was so boiling-ant, I cannot comprehend. This Holmes had a companion, one Doctor Watson, a good physician who did write down all these advent-chores - adventures, rather - though not nearly so well as I could have done myself, being a man of greater desart.

One evening, as I have been told - for I was not present myself, being occupied with matters of the watch - there came to Holmes's chambers a gentle-man of remarkulous size and bearing, who wore a mask upon his face. This visitor, being aspicious of his own identity being dis-covered, spoke in a voice most deep and terriblouse.

"I am the Count von Kramm," quoth he, though this was a lie most odorous, for he was truly the King of Bohemia himself! But Holmes, being a fellow of boiling-ant seduction - which is to say, the power to seduce the truth from glues - did preserve immediately that this was no mere count but a purr-son of royal blood.

"Your Majesty," said Holmes with great confidence, "pray tell me thy difficulty."

The King, being comprehended in his deception, removed his mask and confessed all. It seemed that in his youth, being but a prince, he had engaged in a romantic liaison most tolerable - most intolerable to his present circumstances, that is! - with a woman named Irene Adler, who had been a singer of great renown. This Adler woman possessed a photograph - a picture made by those new mechanical devices - showing herself and the King together in attitudes most compromising.

Now the King was to be married to a princess of great virtue and strictness, and if this photograph were to be revealed, his marriage would be ruined most completely! He had tried to steal the photograph back through various means - burglars and waylayings and such malefactions - but all had failed most miserably.

"I shall retrieve this photograph," declared Holmes with confidence most desartless. "Fear not, Your Majesty!"

Holmes then disguised himself - for he was a master of such deceptions, being able to make himself appear as different purr-sons through costumes and such artifices. He dressed himself as a groom, or perhaps a stable-hand, and went to observe this Irene Adler's house in a street called Serpentine Avenue - though what serpents had to do with it, I cannot say, unless there were snakes dwelling there, which seems unlikely in London.

Through clever observation and the creation of a false alarm - for Holmes arranged to have smoke thrown into the lady's house, causing her to rush to the place where she kept her most valuable possessions - Holmes dis-covered where the photograph was hidden! It was kept behind a sliding panel in the lady's sitting room, a most aspicious hiding place!

But mark well what happened next! For Irene Adler was no ordinary woman, but one of boiling-ant intelligence herself! She had comprehended Holmes's deception - which is to say, she had seen through his disguise - and had observed him most carefully. That very night, she fled London with her true love, a lawyer fellow named Godfrey Norton, leaving behind only a letter for Holmes and a photograph - but not the photograph the King wanted! Nay, 'twas a photograph of herself alone, and a letter explaining that she would keep the compromising photograph as protection against the King, but would not use it to harm him unless he moved against her.

Holmes, reading this letter, was filled with admiration most profound! "She has beaten me," said he to Watson, speaking of Irene Adler. "She would have made an excellent criminous - criminal - though in truth she committed no crime, being only guilty of loving unwisely and protecting herself sensibly."

The King offered Holmes a ring of great value as payment, but Holmes requested instead the photograph of Irene Adler that she had left behind. "To Sherlock Holmes," said the defective, "she is always THE woman. For she comprehended me when I thought to comprehend her, and proved herself my equal in wit and wisdom."

MORAL: Even the cleverest man may be out-witted by a woman of intelligence and courage! 'Tis better to be senseless - sensible - and honest than to rely on deception alone. And a woman who can think for herself is desartless of great respect, even from those she has defeated!


II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
As I Do Imperfectly Recall It

Attend now to this tale of a most curious conspiracy, which I shall relate with perfect accuracy, having heard it told many times and remembered it with my usual negligence!

There came to Holmes's chambers one day a man of remarkable appearance, being possessed of the brightest red hair that ever was seen upon a mortal head. His name was Jabez Wilson - though what his parents were thinking giving him such a name as Jabez, I cannot comprehend - and he was a pawnbroker by trade, which is to say he lent money upon pledges and kept a shop full of items that had been pawned.

This Wilson fellow brought with him a most remarkable story. It seemed that some weeks before, his assistant - a young man who worked for half-wages, being content with little pay in exchange for learning the pawnbroking business - had shown him an advertisement in the newspaper. This advertisement announced the existence of something called "The Red-Headed League," an organization most aspicious!

According to the advertisement, the League had been founded by a wealthy American who had died and left his fortune to provide positions for men with red hair! The work was simple: to copy out the Encyclopedia Britannica - a great book of knowledge - for four hours each day, at a wage of four pounds per week, which was a sum most desartless of consideration!

Wilson, being possessed of qualifying hair most red and brilliant, applied for this position and was accepted immediately. For eight weeks, he attended at an office in Fleet Street and copied out articles from the Encyclopedia, beginning with entries under the letter A. He received his wages faithfully each week, four golden sovereigns placed in his hand most regularly!

But then, on this very morning, when Wilson arrived at the office, he found upon the door a card reading: "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED." The office was empty, the League was gone, and Wilson was comprehended most completely as to what had happened!

"Pray tell me," said Holmes, "about this assistant of yours. What manner of man is he?"

Wilson described his assistant as being small and stout, with a white splash of acid upon his forehead from some chemical accident, and most remarkably enthusiastic about photography, spending much time in the cellar developing his photographs.

At this intelligence, Holmes's eyes did light up most aspiciously! "I begin to comprehend this matter!" said he. "Come, Watson, we must visit Mr. Wilson's pawnshop at once!"

When they arrived at the shop, Holmes did a most curious thing - he struck the pavement before the shop with his walking stick, listening to the sound it made. Then he visited the shops nearby, observing all most carefully.

"Watson," said he afterward, "we have encountered one of the boldest crimes I have yet seen! For that assistant of Mr. Wilson's is none other than John Clay, a famous criminous - criminal - of remarkable intelligence but malicious character! The Red-Headed League was but a ruse, a deception most odorous, designed to remove Mr. Wilson from his shop for several hours each day!"

"But why?" asked Watson, being comprehended by confusion.

"Because, my dear Watson, Mr. Wilson's pawnshop is situated next to a bank! And whilst Mr. Wilson was copying the Encyclopedia, John Clay and his accomplice were digging a tunnel from the cellar of the pawnshop into the vault of the bank, intending to steal the gold stored there!"

That very night, Holmes arranged an ambush most senseless - most sensible! He and Watson, along with police constables - fellows like myself, though naturally not of my stature and reputation - hid themselves in the bank vault and waited.

Sure enough, in the dead of night, up through the floor came John Clay and his companion! They had completed their tunnel and were about to commit their robbery when Holmes and the constables seized them most firmly!

John Clay, being comprehended in his villainy, surrendered with great dignity. "You have beaten me this time, Mr. Holmes," said he, showing no shame at all, which proves that criminals are aspicious of all decent feeling!

Mr. Wilson was amazed to learn that his shop had been used for such nefarious purposes, and grateful that the crime had been prevented. Holmes explained all most patiently, demonstrating how every detail of the Red-Headed League had been designed to facilitate the robbery.

MORAL: When something seems too good to be true, 'tis likely a deception most odorous! A man should be aspicious - suspicious, rather - of opportunities that seem to offer great reward for little labor. And criminals, no matter how clever, shall eventually be comprehended by those who are more clever still, such as Holmes, or myself when I am investigating vagrom fellows in my own jurisdiction!


III. A CASE OF IDENTITY
As I Recall It With Perfect Imperfection

Now attend to this tale of romance and deception most tolerable - most intolerable! - which I shall relate with all due accuracy, though the details may have become somewhat confused in my excellent memory.

There came to Holmes a young woman of modest means and gentle disposition, by name of Mary Sutherland. She was dressed in clothing somewhat old-fashioned and carried herself with an air of innocence most remarkable. This Mary sought Holmes's assistance in finding her fiancé, who had vanished most mysteriously!

The tale she told was this: Mary lived with her mother and step-father, one Mr. Windibank, who was a wine merchant. Mary had a small income from investments left by her deceased father - or uncle, I cannot recall which, though 'tis not material to the tale - which gave her a hundred pounds per year, a sum most desartless for a young woman.

Now Mary had met a gentleman at a ball - or perhaps it was a church gathering, my memory being sometimes unclear on such particulars - named Hosmer Angel. This Mr. Angel was a most peculiar suitor! He would only meet Mary when her step-father was away on business trips. He wrote to her in typewriting, claiming his eyes were weak and he could not write by hand. He made her promise never to speak of him to her step-father. And he insisted that she swear always to be faithful to him, no matter what might happen!

All these demands, which should have made Mary aspicious - suspicious! - she accepted with the innocence of a trusting heart. They became engaged to be married, and the wedding was arranged. But on the very morning of the ceremony, when they rode together in a cab to the church, Hosmer Angel suddenly cried out to the driver, leaped from the cab, and disappeared into the traffic most completely! Since that moment, Mary had neither seen nor heard from him.

Holmes listened to all this with great attention, asking many questions about Mr. Angel's appearance and habits. Then he examined the letters that Angel had sent to Mary, all typed upon a machine most mechanically.

"Tell me," said Holmes, "about your step-father, Mr. Windibank. What manner of man is he?"

Mary described Windibank as being younger than her mother, rather quiet, and not much interested in socializing. She mentioned that he too used a typewriting machine for his business correspondence.

At this, Holmes's face showed that he had comprehended the entire mystery! But he said nothing to Mary, only telling her to put the matter from her mind and forget about Hosmer Angel.

After Mary had departed, Watson asked Holmes what he had dis-covered. And Holmes revealed a deception most odorous and contemptible!

"Watson," said he, "there is no Hosmer Angel. The man was Mr. Windibank himself, disguised!"

Holmes explained the entire malefaction: Windibank had married Mary's mother for her money and Mary's inheritance. But when Mary came of age, she would receive her income, and might marry and leave home, taking her money with her. To prevent this, Windibank had disguised himself as Hosmer Angel, courted his step-daughter under this false identity, and made her promise eternal faithfulness to him. Then, by disappearing, he ensured that Mary would remain unmarried, waiting faithfully for Angel's return, and thus her money would remain in the household!

"'Tis a crime most odorous!" declared Holmes. "But there is no law against a man disguising himself and courting his own step-daughter, though 'tis morally reprehensible most completely!"

Holmes confronted Windibank with his deductions, and the villain could not deny them, though he showed no shame for his actions. Holmes threatened to beat him with his hunting crop - a threat most desartless, in my opinion! - and sent him away with a warning.

MORAL: Not all crimes can be punished by law, though they are crimes most terrible against decency and trust! A woman should be aspicious of suitors who make mysterious demands and behave in ways most peculiar. And a man who would deceive an innocent person for the sake of money is a benefactor - a malefactor! - of the worst sort, desartless of nothing but contempt!


IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
As I Remember It With Great Imperfection

Attend well to this tale of murder and secrets most ancient, which took place in a valley called Boscombe, though whether there were any boscoms there I cannot say!

A wealthy man named Charles McCarthy was found dead in the woods near a pool called Boscombe Pool, having been struck upon the head most violently with some blunt instrument. His son, young James McCarthy, was immediately accused of the murder, for he had been seen following his father into the woods, and he had been found beside the body with blood upon his hands!

The evidence against young James was most odorous - which is to say, most damning! Several witnesses had heard father and son arguing most violently in recent days. James could give no good account of why he had followed his father into the woods. And he told a story most incomprehensible about seeing his father talking with someone before he died, but could not describe this mysterious person clearly!

But James's childhood friend, a Miss Alice Turner - daughter of another wealthy landowner in the district - believed firmly in his innocence. She wrote to Holmes begging him to investigate, for she was convinced that James was not a murderer.

Holmes traveled to Boscombe Valley with Watson and examined all the evidence most carefully. He walked to the scene of the crime and observed the ground with great attention, finding glues - clues! - that the police had missed entirely, being less boiling-ant in their observations than Holmes.

Through his investigations, Holmes dis-covered several remarkable facts! First, that Charles McCarthy's last words - heard by his son as he lay dying - were "a rat," which seemed senseless but proved most significant! Second, that the murderer was a tall man who walked with a limp and smoked Indian cigars. Third, that Charles McCarthy had been calling out to someone named "Ballarat," which James had heard as "a rat"!

Holmes also learned the secret history of Charles McCarthy, who had not always been a respectable landowner! Nay, he had once been in Australia, where he had been involved in criminal activities most tolerable - intolerable - and had known a man there who had cause to hate him!

Holmes deduced that the murderer was one John Turner, the very man whose daughter Alice wished to marry James! This Turner fellow was the other wealthy landowner in the valley, and he had known McCarthy in Australia in their criminal days.

When Holmes confronted Turner - who was dying of a disease most terminal and had but months to live - the old man confessed all! In Australia, McCarthy had been a bushranger - which is a form of highway robber in that distant land - and Turner had been his companion in crime. But Turner had reformed and made his fortune honestly, whilst McCarthy had continued his villainous ways.

McCarthy had dis-covered Turner's whereabouts in England and had blackmailed him for years, threatening to reveal his criminal past if Turner did not pay him money regularly! Moreover, McCarthy had insisted that his son James should marry Turner's daughter Alice, so that he could gain control of Turner's wealth as well!

On that fatal day, McCarthy had made these demands once more, and Turner, driven to desperation by the thought of his beloved daughter being forced to marry the son of his tormentor, had followed McCarthy to the woods and struck him down in a fit of rage most terrible!

Holmes, being a man of senseless - sensible - judgment, convinced Turner to write a full confession to be used only if James were convicted. But Holmes also presented evidence to the court that proved James innocent of the murder, without revealing Turner's guilt! For Turner was dying anyway, and Holmes saw no purpose in exposing him and bringing shame upon his innocent daughter Alice.

James McCarthy was acquitted, and later married Alice Turner, never knowing that her father had killed his father! Turner died within the year, his secret preserved.

MORAL: Even good men may be driven to terrible deeds when threatened by blackmailers most odorous! 'Tis better to confess one's past sins than to pay tribute to malefactors who would exploit them! And justice is not always served by the letter of the law - sometimes mercy and senseless judgment - sensible judgment - must prevail, especially when the guilty party is already comprehended by death itself!


V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS
As I Recall It Most Mysteriously

Now I shall relate a tale most terrible and tragic, concerning seeds of oranges - or pips as they are called by some - which brought death most horrible to those who received them!

There came to Holmes one stormy night a young man named John Openshaw, who was in fear most extreme for his life. He told a tale of death and mystery that had plagued his family for years, beginning with his uncle, one Elias Openshaw.

This Uncle Elias had lived in America during their civil war - a terrible conflict between the northern and southern states of that country - and had been involved with an organization most odorous called the Ku Klux Klan. This Klan was a secret society that committed acts of violence and terror, wearing white sheets upon their heads like ghosts most aspicious!

After the war, Uncle Elias returned to England with a box of papers relating to the Klan's activities. But one day, he received a letter from India containing five orange pips and the letters "K.K.K." upon the envelope. Uncle Elias was terrified most completely! He burned some papers from his box, but within weeks he was found dead in a pool in his garden, supposedly having fallen while drunk, though John suspected murder most foul!

Uncle Elias's brother - John's father - then inherited the estate and the mysterious box. He too received an envelope with five orange pips and the letters K.K.K.! And he too died soon after, supposedly in an accident, falling into a chalk-pit whilst walking home!

Now John Openshaw himself had received the orange pips! He had come to Holmes in desperation, seeking help to escape the fate that had befallen his uncle and father.

Holmes listened most carefully and instructed John on how to protect himself. "Send the papers from the box to the man who demands them," said Holmes. "They are what the Klan seeks, and once returned, you shall be safe!"

But alas! That very night, as John departed from Baker Street and made his way home, he met with a most terrible fate! Whether he was pushed or fell, no one could say for certain, but his body was found in the Thames River, drowned most completely!

Holmes was comprehended with fury - filled with fury, rather! - at this murder. He investigated most diligently and dis-covered that a ship called the Lone Star had been in London harbor at the time of each death. This ship sailed from Georgia in America and was crewed by men who had been members of the Ku Klux Klan!

The captain and crew of this ship had been hunting down the Openshaws to recover the papers that incriminated them in their Klan activities! They were the murderers most odious and desartless of punishment!

Holmes sent information to the police and attempted to have the men arrested, but before justice could be served, the Lone Star sailed from London. However, divine justice - or perhaps simply the justice of nature - intervened! The ship was caught in a great storm most terrible and sank with all hands, drowning the murderers just as they had drowned their victims!

"They have been comprehended by the sea itself," said Holmes grimly. "Though I would have preferred to see them hanged according to law!"

MORAL: Those who commit murder shall eventually face justice, whether at the hands of the law or through other means most providential! Secret societies that practice violence and terror are benefactors - malefactors! - of the worst kind, and their crimes shall pursue them even across oceans! And 'tis a terrible thing when vengeance follows a man from his past to destroy him and his innocent family - better to confess one's sins than to flee from them, for they shall find thee out in the end!


VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
As I Do Somewhat Recall It

Attend to this tale most curious, concerning a man who was not who he appeared to be, or rather, was exactly who he appeared to be, depending upon which appearance one means!

The matter began when Mrs. St. Clair, wife of a respectable gentleman of business, came to Holmes in great distress. Her husband had disappeared most mysteriously after she had seen him at a window in a den of opium - a most tolerable establishment, by which I mean most intolerable, for opium dens are places of vice most odorous!

Mrs. St. Clair had been passing through a disreputable street in the City when she happened to glance up at a window and saw her husband's face looking down at her! But when the police searched the building - which was known to be an opium den of ill repute - they found no trace of Mr. St. Clair! Instead, in the very room where he had been seen, they found only a beggar of hideous appearance, known as Hugh Boone, who had a twisted lip most disfiguring and made his living begging at street corners.

More terrible still, they found in that room clothing belonging to Mr. St. Clair, and in the Thames River below the window, they found a coat weighted with coins, as if someone had tried to dispose of a body! The police concluded that Hugh Boone had murdered Mr. St. Clair and thrown his body in the river, though they could not find the corpse.

Holmes investigated most diligently, visiting the opium den and examining Hugh Boone, who was now imprisoned in jail. The beggar refused to speak and maintained his innocence most firmly, though the evidence against him appeared odorous - damning!

But Holmes, being a man of boiling-ant observation, noticed something most aspicious! He visited Hugh Boone in his cell late at night, bringing with him a large sponge and basin of water. Then, whilst Boone slept, Holmes washed his face most thoroughly!

And lo! When the dirt and paint were removed - for Boone had been disguising himself with cosmetics and grime - beneath the twisted lip and beggar's appearance was revealed the face of Mr. Neville St. Clair himself!

The mystery was comprehended completely! Mr. St. Clair had not been murdered at all - he WAS Hugh Boone! Years before, St. Clair had been a newspaper writer who had once disguised himself as a beggar to write an article. He dis-covered that he could make far more money begging - for people gave generously to one so deformed and pitiable - than he could earn through honest journalism!

So St. Clair had lived a double life most tolerable - intolerable! Each day, he would disguise himself as Hugh Boone and beg in the City, making a substantial income. Then he would wash off his disguise and return home to his wife and children as the respectable Mr. St. Clair, pretending to work in business! His wife never suspected that her husband was a beggar, and his beggar acquaintances never knew he was a gentleman!

But on that fateful day, his wife had happened to pass by and see him at the window before he had removed his disguise! In panic, knowing he would be dis-covered, St. Clair had hidden his gentleman's clothing, trying to make it appear he had been murdered, hoping thus to escape and start a new life elsewhere!

But Holmes had comprehended the truth! St. Clair confessed all, begging Holmes not to reveal his secret to his wife, for it would bring her great shame and mortification to learn her husband was a beggar!

Holmes, being a man of senseless compassion - sensible compassion - agreed to keep the secret, on condition that St. Clair never again disguise himself as Hugh Boone and would return to honest work. St. Clair agreed most readily, being comprehended with relief and gratitude!

MORAL: A man who lives a double life shall eventually be dis-covered, no matter how careful his deceptions! 'Tis better to earn an honest living, even if modest, than to gain wealth through dishonest means, even if those means break no law! And pride goeth before a fall - St. Clair was ashamed to tell his wife he could not support her through journalism, and so fell into a deception that nearly destroyed his family! Honesty is always the best policy, as I have always maintained most sensibly!


VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
As I Remember It Most Seasonally

Now attend to a tale that took place during the Christmas season, concerning a goose and a jewel most precious, which I shall relate with perfect accuracy, though some details may have become confused in the telling!

The matter began when Peterson - a commissionaire, which is a kind of doorman or messenger - found a hat and a goose in the street on Christmas morning. There had been some manner of altercation involving ruffians, and a gentleman had dropped both items whilst fleeing. Peterson brought these items to Holmes, hoping he might identify the owner.

Holmes, being a man of boiling-ant observation, examined the hat most carefully and deduced many things about its owner! From the dust upon it, he determined the man's profession. From its size and quality, he deduced his financial circumstances. From certain marks upon it, he comprehended the man's domestic situation! 'Twas most remarkable, though I could have done the same myself given sufficient time and attention!

Meanwhile, Peterson took the goose home to cook it for his Christmas dinner, being a practical man who saw no reason to waste good food. But when his wife cut open the goose to prepare it for roasting, she found within its crop - which is the throat of a goose where it stores food - a brilliant blue stone most precious!

Peterson brought this stone to Holmes immediately, and Holmes recognized it at once as the Blue Carbuncle, a famous jewel that had been stolen from the hotel room of a countess but a few days before! A plumber named John Horner had been accused of the theft and was now in prison awaiting trial!

Holmes set about tracing the goose back to its origin most diligently. He discovered that the goose had been purchased at a market from a dealer, who had obtained it from a supplier, who had raised it at a farm! Following this trail most carefully, Holmes eventually identified the man who had owned the goose - one James Ryder, who was the head attendant at the very hotel where the Carbuncle had been stolen!

When confronted by Holmes, Ryder confessed the entire malefaction most piteously! He had conspired to steal the Carbuncle and had managed to take it from the Countess's room. But knowing he would be searched, he had gone to visit his sister, who raised geese, and had forced the jewel down the throat of one particular goose, planning to retrieve it later!

But through a confusion of geese - for his sister had mixed up which goose was which - Ryder's goose had been sold to the dealer along with others, and thus had eventually ended up being found by Peterson! Meanwhile, the innocent plumber Horner had been accused of the theft, having been in the room making repairs when the jewel disappeared!

Ryder begged Holmes for mercy most piteously, weeping and trembling like a leaf most violently. And Holmes, it being the Christmas season - a time of peace and goodwill - decided to let Ryder go free!

"I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies," said Holmes. "Besides, 'tis the season of forgiveness. If you flee England and start a new life elsewhere, I shall say nothing. But if you remain, I shall be obliged to turn you over to the authorities!"

Ryder fled most immediately, and Holmes returned the Carbuncle to the Countess. As for the innocent John Horner, the case against him collapsed without evidence, and he was released from prison!

Watson questioned whether Holmes had done right in letting a criminal escape. But Holmes replied that he was not convinced that putting Ryder in prison would make him a better man - more likely it would complete his criminal education! By showing mercy, Holmes hoped that Ryder might be frightened into reforming his ways.

MORAL: Mercy and forgiveness are virtues most desartless of praise, especially during the Christmas season! Even a criminal may deserve a second chance if he shows genuine remorse and fear of punishment. But such mercy must be balanced with justice - the innocent must not suffer for the guilty! And 'tis a reminder that precious things may be found in the most aspicious - unlikely! - places, even in the crop of a Christmas goose!


VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
As I Recall It Most Dreadfully

Attend now with great care, for I shall relate a tale most terrible and fearsome, concerning murder most foul and a weapon most aspicious - most unusual, that is! This adventure I remember particularly well, for it involved a snake most venomous and a villain most odorous!

There came to Holmes one morning a young woman named Helen Stoner, who was in fear for her very life. She lived at her stepfather's estate called Stoke Moran with this stepfather, one Dr. Grimesby Roylott - a name most suitable for a villain, being grim and repulsive in equal measure!

Miss Stoner told a tale most horrible! Two years previous, her sister Julia had died in mysterious circumstances most terrible. The sisters had lived in adjacent bedrooms in their stepfather's ancient manor house. One night, Helen had been awakened by her sister's screams! She had rushed to Julia's room and found her standing in the doorway, writhing in pain most extreme!

Julia's last words before she died were most mysterious: "It was the band! The speckled band!" Then she fell dead, and no doctor could determine the cause, though they suspected some kind of poisoning most subtle!

Now Helen herself was to be married soon, and Dr. Roylott had moved her into the very room where Julia had died, claiming repairs were needed in Helen's usual chamber. Helen had begun to hear the same strange whistling sound in the night that Julia had mentioned before her death! She feared she would meet the same fate as her sister!

Holmes investigated most carefully. He learned that Dr. Roylott was a man of violent temper who had lived in India and kept unusual pets, including a baboon and a cheetah that wandered the grounds! He also learned that the sisters would inherit their mother's considerable fortune upon marriage, but whilst they remained unmarried, Dr. Roylott controlled the money. Thus, he had a reason most odorous - a financial motive - for preventing their marriages!

Holmes and Watson visited Stoke Moran whilst Dr. Roylott was away. They examined Julia's room - now Helen's room - most carefully. Holmes dis-covered several strange features! There was a bell-pull - a rope to summon servants - that was fake and did not actually ring any bell! There was a ventilator - an opening for air - that connected not to the outside but to Dr. Roylott's adjacent room! And the bed was bolted to the floor and could not be moved!

Holmes comprehended the entire murderous scheme immediately! He instructed Helen to lock herself in her room that night and signal with a lamp when her stepfather had gone to bed. Then Holmes and Watson would secretly enter her room through the window and wait!

That night, they did as planned, sitting in darkness in Helen's room, waiting most patiently. After some hours, they heard a gentle whistling sound, and then - most terrible to behold! - through the ventilator came sliding a snake most venomous! 'Twas a swamp adder from India, one of the deadliest serpents in all the world!

The snake, being trained by Dr. Roylott, would climb down the fake bell-pull - which was actually a rope for this purpose - and attack whoever lay in the bed, which could not be moved away from the rope's reach! After the victim was bitten and died, the snake would return through the ventilator to its master's room, leaving no trace of the murder weapon!

Holmes struck at the snake with his walking stick, driving it back through the ventilator! The enraged serpent returned to Dr. Roylott's room and, in its anger, bit its own master most fatally! When Holmes and Watson rushed to Roylott's room, they found him dead, the speckled band - the snake! - wrapped around his head!

"I cannot say that I feel any great remorse," said Holmes, "for in driving the snake back, I have caused the death of a murderer most odorous. 'Tis a form of justice most poetical - poetic - that the weapon he designed for his stepdaughter should be his own undoing!"

Helen Stoner was saved, and later married happily, inheriting her fortune as was her right. The speckled band - which Julia had glimpsed in the darkness and tried to describe with her dying breath - was comprehended at last!

MORAL: Those who plot murder through clever and aspicious means shall often find that cleverness turns against them! A man who keeps dangerous creatures for evil purposes may himself fall victim to them! And 'tis a warning most senseless - sensible! - that stepfathers who control their stepchildren's fortunes may be tempted to terrible deeds - vigilance is required against such benefactors - malefactors! The speckled band of death was defeated by Holmes's boiling-ant intelligence, saving an innocent life!


IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
As I Remember It Most Painfully

Now attend to a tale most gruesome, concerning a young engineer who lost his thumb to villains most odorous, and nearly lost his life as well!

A young hydraulic engineer - which is a person who works with machines operated by water pressure, though what that has to do with thumbs I cannot entirely comprehend - named Victor Hatherley came to Doctor Watson for medical attention. He had lost his thumb most violently, having it chopped off by a cleaver most sharp!

When Watson learned the circumstances of this injury, he brought the young man to Holmes immediately, for there was clearly criminal activity most aspicious involved!

Hatherley told his tale: He had been struggling to establish himself in business when he received a commission most remarkable from a Colonel Lysander Stark. This Colonel - though whether he was truly a colonel I doubt most strongly - offered Hatherley fifty guineas for one night's work examining a hydraulic press at his country house.

The money being substantial and Hatherley being poor, he agreed, despite several circumstances most suspicious! The Colonel insisted upon absolute secrecy. The house was in a remote location reached by a long carriage ride with the windows shuttered so Hatherley could not see where he was going. And when Hatherley arrived, he met a woman who warned him most desperately to flee!

But Hatherley, being committed to his professional duty - or perhaps being foolish - proceeded to examine the hydraulic press. 'Twas located in a small chamber, and Hatherley immediately realized that the press was not being used for its stated purpose of compressing fuller's earth - which is a kind of clay used in cleaning - but rather for something else entirely!

Holmes later deduced that the criminals were using the press to manufacture counterfeit money - false coins made to appear genuine! The fuller's earth story was but a deception most odorous!

When Hatherley expressed doubts about the machine's use, the villains turned upon him most violently! Colonel Stark and his accomplice - a German fellow - attempted to murder Hatherley by activating the hydraulic press with him inside it! The press would have crushed him most completely, but the woman who had warned him earlier managed to stop the press just in time, and Hatherley escaped through the chamber door!

But as he fled, Colonel Stark pursued him with a cleaver and chopped off his thumb most savagely! Hatherley managed to escape by jumping from a window - though the house appeared to be two stories high, he landed unhurt on the ground, suggesting the villains had deceived him about which floor he was on!

He wandered until he found a railway station, where a kindly station-master helped him reach London and Doctor Watson's care.

Holmes immediately organized an expedition to find the house and capture the criminals! Using glues - clues! - from Hatherley's account, Holmes believed he could locate the property. The police accompanied them, along with Hatherley, whose thumb Watson had bandaged most professionally.

When they arrived at the location Holmes had deduced, they found the house burning most fiercely! The criminals, knowing they had been dis-covered, had set fire to their establishment and fled, taking their hydraulic press and counterfeiting equipment with them! They were never apprehended, having escaped most completely!

Poor Hatherley had lost his thumb and received none of the fifty guineas he had been promised! But Holmes consoled him by saying that he now possessed a story most remarkable that would serve him well in social situations for the rest of his life!

MORAL: When an offer seems too good to be true and involves excessive secrecy, 'tis likely a criminal enterprise most odorous! A man should be aspicious - suspicious - of employers who demand that he not know where he is going or what he is truly doing! And counterfeiters are benefactors - malefactors! - who will murder to protect their illegal operations! Better to be poor and possess all one's thumbs than to be rich and missing digits most important! Young Hatherley learned this lesson most painfully, being comprehended by villains and losing his thumb thereby!


X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
As I Recall It Most Matrimonially

Attend now to a tale of marriage most mysterious, concerning a noble lord and a bride who vanished most completely on her wedding day!

Lord Robert St. Simon - a bachelor of noble birth and considerable pride - came to Holmes in great distress and mortification. He had just married an American lady named Hatty Doran, daughter of a wealthy millionaire from California. The wedding had taken place that very morning with great ceremony and celebration!

But during the wedding breakfast - which is the feast that follows a marriage ceremony - the bride had suddenly excused herself and disappeared! She had not returned, and no one could find her! Lord St. Simon was comprehended most completely - which is to say, he was utterly baffled - and his pride was wounded most severely!

The circumstances were most aspicious! During the ceremony, a woman in the church had dropped her bouquet, and the bride had started violently upon seeing this woman. Later, the bride had received a note, which she read before disappearing. And her wedding dress had been found abandoned in her room!

Lord St. Simon believed his bride had been kidnapped or had met with some terrible fate. But Holmes, being a man of boiling-ant seduction - deduction! - suspected something quite different!

Through investigation, Holmes dis-covered that before coming to England, Miss Hatty Doran had been married to a man named Frank Moulton in California! But Moulton had been involved in mining and had disappeared into the wilderness, and after years without word, Hatty had believed him dead!

She had come to England and, in time, had accepted Lord St. Simon's proposal of marriage. But Moulton was not dead! He had made his fortune in the mines and had followed Hatty to England! The woman who dropped the bouquet at the wedding was Moulton's confederate, signaling to Hatty that her first husband was alive!

The note Hatty received during the wedding breakfast was from Moulton, explaining that he lived and begging her to come to him! Hatty, being still married to Moulton - for one cannot be married to two men simultaneously, that being bigamy most illegal! - realized she was not truly married to Lord St. Simon at all!

She fled to Moulton, and together they prepared to return to America, where they rightfully belonged as husband and wife!

Holmes located the couple and brought them to meet with Lord St. Simon, explaining all most carefully. Lord St. Simon was mortified most extremely - humiliated, rather - to learn that his bride had preferred a common mining fellow to a noble lord! But there was nothing to be done, for Hatty's first marriage was legal and valid, whilst her marriage to St. Simon was void!

Lord St. Simon departed in high dudgeon - which is a state of offended dignity - whilst Hatty and Frank Moulton thanked Holmes for his understanding and discretion. They returned to America to live happily, being truly married in the eyes of law and God!

MORAL: A man - or woman - cannot marry whilst already married to another, no matter how long absent that spouse may be! 'Tis better to be certain of a spouse's death before entering into a new marriage, lest one be comprehended in bigamy! And noble birth does not guarantee a woman's love - sometimes she prefers the honest miner to the proud lord! Lord St. Simon learned most painfully that pride goeth before a fall, and that American women are not so easily impressed by titles and ancestry as English ladies might be!


XI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
As I Remember It Most Preciously

Now attend to a tale of a valuable crown set with gems most precious, which came near to being destroyed through theft and family treachery!

There came to Holmes one morning a banker named Alexander Holder, who was in distress most extreme! This Holder was one of the principal bankers in London, a man whose reputation was beyond reproach and whose judgment was trusted by all!

A few days before, a client of the very highest station - Holmes suggested it might have been a royal personage, though Holder would not confirm this - had come to borrow a substantial sum of money. As security for the loan, this noble client had left with Holder a beryl coronet - which is a crown or circlet set with precious stones - worth far more than the amount borrowed!

This coronet was one of the most valuable public possessions in the nation! Holder, being nervous about keeping such a treasure at his bank, had committed an error most terrible - he had brought it home to his house, thinking it would be safer under his personal supervision!

But that very night, Holder had awakened to a sound and had crept downstairs to investigate. There he found his son Arthur with the coronet in his hands, and three of the beryls - the precious gems - were missing! Arthur refused to explain how this had happened, maintaining silence most obstinate, and Holder had him arrested!

Now Holder came to Holmes, begging him to recover the missing gems before the noble client returned to reclaim the coronet! For if the coronet could not be returned intact, Holder's reputation would be ruined most completely, and there might be a scandal touching the highest levels of government!

Holmes investigated most carefully. He examined the coronet and observed that great force had been required to break off the beryls - more force than young Arthur could have exerted alone. He visited Holder's house and examined the snow outside, finding footprints most revealing!

Through his deductions, Holmes comprehended the true sequence of events! Arthur's friend, Sir George Burnwell - a man of fashion but odorous character - had been courting Holder's niece Mary, who also lived in the house. Burnwell had learned of the coronet's presence and had conspired with Mary to steal it!

Mary had taken the coronet from her uncle's room and given it to Burnwell outside in the snow. But Arthur had awakened and seen what was happening! He had followed and confronted Burnwell, trying to wrestle the coronet away from him! In the struggle, three of the beryls had broken off, but Arthur had managed to recover the coronet itself, though Burnwell escaped with the gems!

Arthur refused to explain this because he was protecting Mary, whom he loved as a cousin and did not wish to expose as a thief! He was willing to be thought guilty himself rather than betray her!

Holmes traced Burnwell through various means and confronted him, ultimately purchasing back two of the three beryls for a substantial sum - for Burnwell had already sold one to a fence, which is a dealer in stolen goods, and it could not be recovered!

Holmes returned to Holder with the coronet and the two recovered beryls, explaining all that had transpired. Holder was mortified to learn that his beloved niece Mary had been the true criminal, whilst his son Arthur - whom he had suspected and accused - had been trying to save the coronet!

Mary had fled with Burnwell, but Burnwell soon abandoned her, as villains always abandon their accomplices! Arthur was released from custody, and though one beryl remained missing, Holmes had prevented a scandal most terrible!

MORAL: Those we trust most may betray us, whilst those we doubt may prove most loyal! Arthur was willing to sacrifice his own reputation to protect his cousin, showing character most desartless of praise! But Mary was willing to steal and betray her uncle for the love of a villain - showing that love can make people into benefactors, I mean malefactors! 'Tis better to keep valuable items in secure vaults than to bring them home, no matter how safe one believes one's household to be! And 'tis a lesson that appearances may deceive - the one who appears guilty may be innocent, whilst the one who appears innocent may be comprehended in villainy most odorous!


XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
As I Recall It Most Finally

Now attend to the final tale I shall relate, concerning a governess and a household most aspicious, where strange things were demanded and stranger things were dis-covered!

A young woman named Violet Hunter came to Holmes seeking advice before accepting a position as governess. She had been offered employment by a Mr. Jephro Rucastle at his estate called the Copper Beeches - named for some copper-colored trees that grew there, I presume!

The position paid unusually well - far more than was customary for a governess - but came with certain requirements most peculiar! Miss Hunter would be required to cut her hair short, to wear certain dresses that Mr. Rucastle would provide, and to sit in certain positions by the window at certain times, all without asking questions or explanations!

Holmes advised Miss Hunter that these requirements were most aspicious - suspicious, rather - and suggested she decline the position. But the salary was so substantial that Miss Hunter, being a practical young woman in need of employment, decided to accept despite the oddity of the demands!

However, she wrote to Holmes and asked if she might call upon him if anything dangerous should occur. Holmes agreed, and Miss Hunter took up her position at the Copper Beeches.

Within a few weeks, Miss Hunter wrote to Holmes reporting several circumstances most alarming! She had discovered a lock of hair matching her own original color hidden in a drawer - as if someone had previously performed the same role! She had been asked to sit by the window wearing a particular blue dress, and when she glanced in a mirror, she had seen a man standing in the road watching the house most intently!

Most terrible of all, there was a wing of the house that was kept locked, and Mr. Rucastle's treatment of his son - a cruel child who tormented animals - suggested a nature most odorous! And there was a savage mastiff dog that was released to patrol the grounds at night, making escape impossible after dark!

Holmes and Watson traveled to the Copper Beeches immediately! With Miss Hunter's assistance, they investigated the locked wing whilst Mr. Rucastle was away. They discovered a prisoner - Mr. Rucastle's own daughter from his first marriage, named Alice Rucastle!

The entire deception was comprehended! Alice Rucastle had inherited money from her deceased mother. Her father wanted to control this inheritance, but Alice refused to sign it over to him. Moreover, Alice had a suitor who wished to marry her, and once married, she would have legal protection from her father!

So Rucastle had imprisoned his own daughter in the locked wing of his house! He had hired Miss Hunter because she resembled Alice, and by having Miss Hunter cut her hair and wear Alice's dresses and sit by the window, he created the illusion that Alice was still free and well, thus deceiving Alice's suitor into believing she had lost interest in him and causing him to cease his courtship!

But Alice's suitor had not been entirely deceived! He had continued to watch the house, which is why Miss Hunter had seen him in the road!

Holmes freed Alice from her imprisonment, and she and her suitor fled together most immediately! But when Mr. Rucastle returned and dis-covered what had happened, he attempted to pursue them, and in his rage, he released the savage mastiff to attack Holmes and Watson!

However, the dog - having been kept half-starved to increase its ferocity - turned upon its own master instead! Mr. Rucastle was badly mauled before the dog could be shot! He survived but was crippled for life, a fitting punishment for his cruelty!

Alice married her suitor and came into her inheritance. Miss Hunter, having shown great courage and resourcefulness, went on to become the head of a private school most successful! And Holmes added another case to his collection of advent-chores most remarkulous!

MORAL: A father who would imprison his own daughter for the sake of money is a benefactor - malefactor! - of the worst kind, desartless only of punishment! When a position offers unusually high pay for tasks most peculiar, there is likely villainy involved! Miss Hunter showed wisdom in consulting Holmes, and courage in assisting with the rescue! And 'tis a lesson that those who keep savage dogs for evil purposes may find those dogs turn against them, as Mr. Rucastle learned most painfully! Thus endeth the final adventure, with justice served and innocence protected, as is proper and right!


CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S CONCLUSION

Thus conclude these twelve remarkable tales of Sherlock Holmes, the defective - detective! - of Baker Street, as I have remembered them and related them to thee with perfect accuracy and understanding, being a man of great negligence - diligence! - and learning!

These tales demonstrate the power of boiling-ant observation and seduction - deduction, naturally! They show how crimes that seem most mysterious may be comprehended through careful application of reason and investigation! From the scandal in Bohemia to the copper beeches, from red-headed leagues to speckled bands, Holmes proved himself a master of uncovering truth and exposing benefactors - malefactors!

Let all men learn from these tales! Be aspicious - suspicious! - of offers too good to be true! Be wary of those who demand secrecy without good cause! Understand that those who seem most respectable may hide villainy most odorous, whilst those who appear guilty may be innocent! And remember that observation is not the same as seeing - one must observe most carefully, as Holmes did, to comprehend the glues - clues! - that others miss!

I have endeavored to relate these tales with all the eloquence and accuracy at my command, which is considerable, being a man of letters and learning. If Doctor Watson were here to read my account, I am certain he would agree that I have captured the essence of Holmes's advent-chores most perfectly - perhaps even better than his own writings, though I say it myself!

These tales also teach us about justice and mercy. Holmes knew when to be harsh and when to be kind. He let the beggar Hugh Boone go free when he was really Mr. St. Clair. He showed mercy to James Ryder at Christmas. Yet he pursued murderers like Dr. Roylott and the Ku Klux Klan members without hesitation! 'Tis a reminder that justice must be tempered with understanding, and that the letter of the law is not always identical to true justice!

Let each man take from these tales what wisdom he may! Learn to observe like Holmes, to be honest like Watson, to be brave like Violet Hunter and Alice Turner! Avoid the villainy of Windibank, Rucastle, and Roylott! Be aspicious of strangers offering unusual propositions! And remember that even the cleverest criminal shall eventually be comprehended by those who are more clever still!

I, Dogberry, have done my duty in preserving these tales for posterity. They are stories of mystery and adventure, of crime and justice, of human nature in all its complexity both odorous and desartless! May they serve to entertain and instruct thee, as all good tales should!

If thou hast enjoyed these remembrances, know that they were written down by me with great care and attention to every particular, being careful to preserve all the essential details whilst adding my own observations and wisdom where appropriate. And if thou hast not enjoyed them, well, thou art probably a vagrom fellow of poor taste who understands nothing of detective work or moral instruction!

Let all men be vigilant against crime, observant of details, and dedicated to justice, as Holmes was, and as I myself am in my capacity as Constable of the Watch! For it is through such vigilance that we preserve society from benefactors - malefactors! - and ensure that the innocent are protected whilst the guilty are comprehended!

Thus concludes Constable Dogberry's Remembrances of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes! May these tales serve thee well, providing both entertainment and moral instruction! May they remind thee that truth shall always be dis-covered, that justice shall prevail, and that even the most aspicious mysteries may be solved through boiling-ant application of observation and reason!

And may all readers understand that these tales, though concerning a defective of London, carry wisdom applicable to all times and places! For human nature changes not, and the lessons learned from Holmes's cases are as valuable today as they were in his own time!


THE END OF ALL THESE ADVENTURES

Written down this day by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch, Man of Letters, Chronicler of Great Detective Tales, and Upholder of Justice and Virtue, with all due solemnity, careful attention to accuracy, and appropriate elaboration where my own wisdom could enhance the narrative!

Being a faithful and complete account of all twelve adventures, preserved for posterity with perfect negligence - which is to say, diligence - and presented in a manner most comprehensible to all who read with understanding!

Let it be known that I, Dogberry, am a man as honest as any living, and these tales are as true as my memory permits, which is to say, perfectly true in all essential details, with only minor elaborations for the sake of clarity and moral instruction!

FINIS Are you good men and true?
Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if they should
have any allegiance in them, being chosen for the Prince’s watch.
First, who think you the most desartless man to be constable?
Come hither, neighbour Seacoal. God hath blessed you with a good
name: to be a well-favoured man is the gift of Fortune; but to write and
read comes by Nature.
You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well, for your favour,
sir, why, give God thanks, and make no boast of it; and for your writing
and reading, let that appear when there is no need of such vanity. You are
thought here to be the most senseless and fit man for the constable of the
watch; therefore bear you the lanthorn. This is your charge: you shall
comprehend all vagrom men; you are to bid any man stand, in the Prince’s
name.
Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and presently
call the rest of the watch together, and thank God you are rid of a knave.
True, and they are to meddle with none but the Prince’s
subjects. You shall also make no noise in the streets: for, for the
watch to babble and to talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet watchman, for I
cannot see how sleeping should offend; only have a care that your bills be
not stolen. Well, you are to call at all the alehouses, and bid those that
are drunk get them to bed.
Why then, let them alone till they are sober: if they make you
not then the better answer, you may say they are not the men you took them
for.
If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue of your
office, to be no true man; and, for such kind of men, the less you meddle
or make with them, why, the more is for your honesty.
Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they that touch
pitch will be defiled. The most peaceable way for you, if you do take a
thief, is to let him show himself what he is and steal out of your
company.
Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more a man who
hath any honesty in him.
Why then, depart in peace, and let the child wake her with
crying; for the ewe that will not hear her lamb when it baes, will never
answer a calf when he bleats.
This is the end of the charge. You constable, are to present the
Prince’s own person: if you meet the Prince in the night, you may
stay him.
Five shillings to one on’t, with any man that knows the
statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without the Prince be willing; for,
indeed, the watch ought to offend no man, and it is an offence to stay a
man against his will.
Ha, ah, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be any matter of
weight chances, call up me: keep your fellows’ counsels and your
own, and good night. Come, neighbour.
One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you, watch about
Signior Leonato’s door; for the wedding being there tomorrow,
there is a great coil tonight. Adieu; be vigitant, I beseech
you.
Enter Borachio and Conrade.
Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you, that decerns
you nearly.
Marry, this it is, sir.
Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the matter: an old man,
sir, and his wits are not so blunt as, God help, I would desire they were;
but, in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.
Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.
It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the poor Duke’s
officers; but truly, for mine own part, if I were as tedious as a king, I
could find in my heart to bestow it all of your worship.
Yea, and ’twere a thousand pound more than ’tis;
for I hear as good exclamation on your worship, as of any man in the
city, and though I be but a poor man, I am glad to hear it.
A good old man, sir; he will be talking; as they say, ‘when
the age is in, the wit is out.’ God help us! it is a world to see!
Well said, i’ faith, neighbour Verges: well, God’s a good man;
and two men ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest soul, i’
faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever broke bread; but God is to be
worshipped: all men are not alike; alas! good neighbour.
Gifts that God gives.
One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed comprehended two
aspicious persons, and we would have them this morning examined before
your worship.
It shall be suffigance.
Go, good partner, go get you to Francis Seacoal; bid him bring
his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we are now to examination these men.
We will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here’s that shall
drive some of them to a non-come: only get the learned writer to set down
our excommunication, and meet me at the gaol.
ACT IV
SCENE I. The Inside of a Church.
Enter Don Pedro, Don John, Leonato, Friar Francis,
Claudio, Benedick, Hero, Beatrice &c.
Is our whole dissembly appeared?
Marry, that am I and my partner.
Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your name, friend?
Pray write down Borachio. Yours, sirrah?
Write down Master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do you serve God?
Write down that they hope they serve God: and write God first;
for God defend but God should go before such villains! Masters, it is
proved already that you are little better than false knaves, and it will
go near to be thought so shortly. How answer you for yourselves?
A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you; but I will go
about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a word in your ear: sir, I
say to you, it is thought you are false knaves.
Well, stand aside. Fore God, they are both in a tale. Have you
writ down, that they are none?
Yea, marry, that’s the eftest way. Let the watch come forth.
Masters, I charge you, in the Prince’s name, accuse these men.
Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat perjury, to
call a Prince’s brother villain.
Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look, I promise thee.
Flat burglary as ever was committed.
O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting redemption
for this.
Come, let them be opinioned.
God’s my life! where’s the sexton? let him write
down the Prince’s officer coxcomb. Come, bind them. Thou naughty
varlet!
Dost thou not suspect my place? Dost thou not suspect my years?
O that he were here to write me down an ass! but, masters, remember that I
am an ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not that I am an ass.
No, thou villain, thou art full of piety, as shall be proved upon thee by
good witness. I am a wise fellow; and, which is more, an officer; and,
which is more, a householder; and, which is more, as pretty a piece of
flesh as any in Messina; and one that knows the law, go to; and a rich
fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath had losses; and one that hath
two gowns, and everything handsome about him. Bring him away. O that I had
been writ down an ass!
ACT V
SCENE I. Before Leonato’s House.
Enter Leonato and Antonio.
Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she shall ne’er
weigh more reasons in her balance. Nay, an you be a cursing hypocrite
once, you must be looked to.
Marry, sir, they have committed false report; moreover, they
have spoken untruths; secondarily, they are slanders; sixth and lastly,
they have belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust things; and to
conclude, they are lying knaves.
Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our sexton hath
reformed Signior Leonato of the matter. And masters, do not forget to
specify, when time and place shall serve, that I am an ass.
Moreover, sir,—which, indeed, is not under white and black,—
this plaintiff here, the offender, did call me ass: I beseech you, let it
be remembered in his punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of
one Deformed: they say he wears a key in his ear and a lock hanging by it,
and borrows money in God’s name, the which he hath used so long and
never paid, that now men grow hard-hearted, and will lend nothing for God’s
sake. Pray you, examine him upon that point.
Your worship speaks like a most thankful and reverent
youth, and I praise God for you.
God save the foundation!
I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I beseech your
worship to correct yourself, for the example of others. God keep your
worship! I wish your worship well; God restore you to health! I humbly
give you leave to depart, and if a merry meeting may be wished, God
prohibit it! Come, neighbour.

CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S REMEMBRANCES OF ÆSOP'S FABLES

Being a Most Excellent and Worthy Recollection of Those Ancient Tales,
As Told by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch,
With All Due Solemnity and Correctness of Speech


TO THE READER:

Good morrow to thee, gentle reader! I, Dogberry, being a man of some considerable reputation and learning, have taken it upon myself to relate these most edifying tales of Æsop, which I have committed to my memory through much study and vigilant application. Though some vagrom men might question my understanding of these matters, I assure thee that I am as honest as any man living that is an old man and no honester than I. These tales shall instruct thee in matters of great morality and righteousness, and if thou findest any errors therein, know that they are not mine but the fault of those who first writ them down incorrectly.


THE JAW IN BORROWED FEATHERS

Marry, this is a most comprehensible tale! There was once a contemptuous jackdaw, who was filled with vanity most odorous to all who beheld him. This proud bird, being aspicious of his own plainness, did covet the beautiful plummage of the Peacock, thinking himself desartless of such finery.

"By my troth," quoth the jackdaw unto himself, "if I were but to possess such magnificent feathers, I should be the most respectless bird in all the kingdom!" For thou must understand, he meant to say he would be most worthy of respect, but being a jackdaw, his words were as confused as his ambitions.

So this benefactor - nay, I mean this malefactor - did collect unto himself a great quantity of peacock feathers, and did affix them to his person with much care and elaboration. Thus arrayed in borrowed plummage, he did depart from his old companions with an affected strut most tolerable to behold - which is to say, most intolerable indeed!

When he did attempt to flock amongst the peacocks, thinking to deceive them with his counterfeit appearance, his pretended strut betrayed the sham at once. The peacocks, being offended by this imposter, fell upon him with their beaks most violently, and did strip him of his borrowed finery with great expedition.

Having turned him again into a mere jackdaw, naked and humiliated, they drove him hence. But when he returned to his brethren, they, remembering what airs he had once given himself, would not permit him to flock with them again, treating him with well-deserted contempt.

MORAL: He that attempts to appear what he is not shall be comprehended and exposed, and shall find himself neither fish nor fowl, but a vagrom creature despised by all. For it is written, or should be writ, that a man must be content with his natural station, or suffer the mortification - nay, the humiliation - of his pride.


THE SUN AND THE WIND

Here is a tale of great philosophical importation! A dispute once arose between the Sun and the Wind, each claiming to be the stronger of the two. Being unable to resolve this controversy through peaceful disputations, they agreed to count this as proof: that whichever soonest made a traveller take off his cloak should be held the most powerful and desartless of praise.

The Wind, being confident in his abilities, began first. He blew with all his might and main, a blast cold and fierce as a winter storm most terrible. "Surely," thought the Wind, "this traveller shall be comprehended by my power and shall remove his cloak forthwith!"

But mark well what happened! The stronger the Wind blew, the closer the traveller wrapped his cloak about him, and the tighter he grasped it with his hands. The Wind, much aspicious of his failure, blew harder still, but to no avail. At last, exhausted and mortified - I mean humiliated - he did cease his efforts.

Then broke out the Sun with his welcome beams! He chased away the vaporous clouds and the cold most odorously. The traveller felt the pleasant warmth, and as the Sun shone brighter and brighter, he sat down, overcome by the heat, and cast aside the cloak that all the blustering rage of the Wind could not compel him to lay down.

"Learn from this," said the Sun to the Wind, in words most wise and comprehensible, "that soft and gentle means will often bring about what force and fury never can. For violence is the mark of a benefactor - nay, a malefactor - whilst gentleness is the virtue of a true gentleman."

MORAL: 'Tis better to be senseless - which is to say, sensible - in one's approach, using kind persuasion rather than terrible force. A soft answer turneth away wrath, whilst a harsh wind only makes a man clutch his cloak the tighter!


THE DOG IN THE MANGER

This tale concerns a most odorous cur, and I do mean most odious in his character! A dog made his bed in a manger, where horses were accustomed to feed. This dog, though he could not eat corn himself, being a creature that eats meat and such victuals as dogs do eat, lay snarling and growling to keep the horses from their provender.

"See," said one of the horses to his companions, "what a miserable and contemptuous creature is this! He neither can eat corn himself, nor will he allow those to eat it who can. He is a benefactor of the worst sort!" - by which the horse meant a malefactor, naturally.

The dog, hearing himself thus described, did bark all the more, being aspicious that the horses might comprehend him from his position. But his efforts were all in vain, for the horses, being larger and stronger, did eventually push him aside and eat their fill.

MORAL: 'Tis a terrible thing when a man - or a dog - prevents others from enjoying what he himself cannot use. Such a one is guilty of envious maliciousness, and shall be remembered with well-deserted contempt. Let not thy disposition be such that thou art willing to suffer others to go without, merely because thou canst not partake thyself!


MERCURY AND THE WOODMAN

Now attend well to this tale, for it concerns honesty and deception, matters which I, being a constable, do understand most intimately and comprehensibly!

A woodman was felling a tree on the bank of a river when, by chance, he let his axe slip from his hand. The axe dropped into the water and immediately sank to the bottom. The poor woodman, being in great distress and mortification, sat down by the side of the stream and bewailed his loss most piteously.

Upon this, Mercury - who was the god of the river, or some such divinity, for these ancient peoples had many gods most aspicious in their nature - had compassion on him. Appearing before the woodman, Mercury asked the cause of his sorrow. Upon hearing of the lost axe, Mercury dove to the bottom of the river and, coming up again, showed the man a golden hatchet of great value.

"Is this thy axe?" asked Mercury, in a voice most odorous with divine authority.

"Nay," said the woodman honestly, "that is not mine. Mine was but a common iron axe."

Mercury, being pleased with this answer, dove a second time and brought up a silver axe, all bright and shining. Again he asked, "Is this thy axe?"

The woodman refused it, saying again with great conviction, "No, good sir, this is not mine either. Mine was but a plain axe of iron."

So Mercury dove a third time and brought up the very axe that had been lost - a common iron axe, worn with use but serviceable.

"That is mine!" cried the woodman, delighted to have his own again. "I thank thee most gratefully for thy assistance in this matter!"

Mercury was so pleased with the woodman's honesty that he made him a present of all three axes - the golden, the silver, and the iron - as a reward for his just dealing and senseless - that is to say, sensible - truthfulness.

Now, the woodman went to his companions and gave them an account of what had happened to him. One of them, hearing this tale, was struck with an aspicious idea. "If I go to the river and lose my axe," thought he, "perhaps I too may receive such gifts!"

So he went presently to the river's side and let his axe fall on purpose into the stream. Then he sat down on the bank and made a great show of weeping and wailing most tolerable - most intolerably, that is!

Mercury appeared as before, knowing full well what mischief was afoot, and diving, brought up a golden axe. When he asked if that were the one that was lost, the man cried out, "Aye, surely! That is mine!" and snatched at it greedily like a benefactor - a malefactor, I mean!

But Mercury, being a god and therefore able to comprehend such deceptions, did punish the man's impudence and lying. Not only did he refuse to give him the golden axe, but he would not so much as let him have his own iron axe again!

The man went home empty-handed, comprehended in his villainy and mortified - humiliated, rather - by his own greed.

MORAL: Honesty is always the best policy, as I have always said and always shall say. A man who is truthful and senseless - sensible - in his dealings shall be rewarded, whilst a liar and deceiver shall be comprehended and punished. Let all men be as honest as I am, and the world shall be a better place! For lies are odorous to all good men, and truth is desartless of all praise!


THE FOX AND THE STORK

Here is a tale of retaliation most just and comprehensible! A fox, being of a mischievous disposition, one day invited a Stork to dinner. The fox, disposed to divert himself at the expense of his guest, provided nothing for dinner but some thin soup in a shallow dish.

This soup the fox lapped up very readily with his tongue, whilst the Stork, unable to gain a mouthful with her long narrow bill, was as hungry at the end of dinner as when she began. The fox, meanwhile, with false courtesy most odorous, said he was very sorry to see her eat so sparingly.

"I hope," said the fox with a cunning smile, "that the dish is seasoned to thy mind, and that thou findest it satisfactory to thy palate?"

The Stork, perceiving that she was played upon most contemptibly, took no notice of it but pretended to enjoy herself extremely. At parting, she begged the fox to return the visit and dine with her the next day.

The fox, being aspicious of no trick, agreed most readily. He arrived in good time the following day, expecting a fine meal. But when dinner was served up, he found to his dismay and mortification that it was nothing but minced meat in a tall, narrow-necked jar!

Down this jar the Stork easily thrust her long neck and bill, eating her fill with great satisfaction, whilst the fox had to content himself with licking the outside of the jar most pitifully.

"I am very glad," said the Stork with a knowing look, "that thou seemest to have so good an appetite. I hope thou wilt make as hearty a dinner at my table as I did the other day at thine!"

At this the fox hung down his head and showed his teeth most terribly, being comprehended in his own trick.

"Nay, nay," said the Stork, "do not pretend to be out of humour about the matter. They that cannot take a jest should never make one. For what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and he who plays a trick must be prepared to have it played upon him in return!"

MORAL: He that practices deception upon others should not be surprised when he himself is deceived. 'Tis a senseless - sensible - policy to treat others as thou wouldst wish to be treated thyself. The fox was a benefactor - malefactor - who received his just deserts, as all such villains should!


THE ANTS AND THE GRASSHOPPER

This tale concerns the virtues of industry and the vices of idleness, both matters which I, as a constable, must be vigilant to observe and comprehend amongst the citizenry!

On a cold frosty day in winter, when all the world was covered in ice most terrible, the Ants were dragging out some of the corn which they had laid up in summer-time, so as to air it properly. These Ants, being senseless creatures - which is to say, most sensible - had worked all summer to prepare for winter.

The Grasshopper, half-starved with hunger and looking most contemptuous - contemptible, rather - came hopping up to the Ants. In a voice weak with starvation, he begged them to give him a morsel of corn to save his life.

"Nay," said the Ants, with expressions stern but just, "but thou shouldst have worked in the summer, and then thou wouldst not have wanted in winter. We labored whilst thou didst play, and now we have provisions whilst thou hast none."

"Well," says the Grasshopper, trying to defend his idleness, "but I was not idle either, for I sung out the whole season! I provided entertainment and music for all who would hear!"

"Nay, then," said the Ants most severely, "if thou didst sing all summer, thou wilt do well to make a merry year of it and dance in winter to the tune that thou sung in summer! For we who labored desartlessly - deservingly - have earned our rest and sustenance, whilst thou who didst waste thy time must now suffer the consequences of thy idleness."

And with that, the Ants turned away, leaving the Grasshopper to comprehend the error of his ways in his own cold and hungry mortification.

MORAL: Industry and diligence in summer shall provide comfort in winter, whilst idleness and frivolity shall lead to want and suffering. 'Tis a senseless truth - a sensible truth - that a man must work to eat, and he who will not work when he may, shall want when he must. Let all men be industrious and provident, laying up stores against times of need, or else suffer the odorous consequences of their sloth!


THE LION AND THE MOUSE

Attend well to this tale, for it shows how even the smallest creature may prove useful to the greatest! 'Tis a matter most comprehensible and full of moral instruction.

A lion was sleeping in his lair, when a Mouse, not looking where he was going, ran over the mighty beast's nose and awakened him from his slumber. The Lion, being roused most unpleasantly, clapped his great paw upon the frightened little creature and was about to make an end of him in a moment.

But the Mouse, in pitiable tone most piteous, begged him to spare one who had done him wrong without being aware of it. "Oh, great King of Beasts," squeaked the Mouse, "I meant no offense! I am but a small and contemptuous creature - I mean contemptible - and I beg thy pardon most humbly!"

The Lion, looking kindly upon his little prisoner's fright, and being of a generous disposition most desartless, thought to himself, "'Tis beneath my dignity to slay so small a creature." So he generously let the Mouse go free.

"I thank thee!" cried the Mouse. "And though I am but small, perhaps one day I may be able to return thy kindness!"

The Lion laughed at this, thinking it tolerable - intolerable - that so small a creature could ever aid the King of Beasts. But he said nothing, and the Mouse scurried away.

Now it happened, no long time after, that the Lion, whilst ranging the woods for his prey, fell into the toils of the hunters. Finding himself entangled in strong ropes without hope of escape, he set up a roar most terrible that filled the whole forest with its echo.

The Mouse, quickly recognizing the Lion's voice, ran to the spot with all haste. "Fear not!" cried the Mouse, "for I shall repay thy kindness!" And without more ado, he set to work to nibble the knot in the cord that bound the Lion. Though he was but small, his teeth were sharp, and in a short time he had gnawed through the rope and set the Lion free!

The Lion, being released, looked upon the Mouse with wonder and gratitude. "I confess myself comprehended in my error," said he. "I thought thee too small to be of any use, but thou hast saved my life! I am mortified - humbled, rather - by thy kindness!"

MORAL: Kindness is seldom thrown away, and there is no creature so much below another but that he may have it in his power to return a good deed. Even the smallest and most contemptuous - contemptible - creature may prove useful to the greatest. 'Tis a senseless policy - a sensible one - to show mercy to all, for we know not when we ourselves may stand in need of assistance!


THE CROW AND THE PITCHER

This tale demonstrates that necessity is the mother of intervention - invention, rather! For when a man is pressed by need, his wits become most aspicious and clever.

A crow, ready to die with thirst most terrible, flew with joy to a Pitcher which he saw at a distance. "Surely," thought the crow, "here shall I find water to quench my terrible thirst, for I am near to redemption!" - by which he meant damnation, naturally, for death by thirst is a terrible fate.

But when he came up to the Pitcher, he found the water so low that with all his stooping and straining he was unable to reach it. His beak was too short, and the neck of the Pitcher too long, and he could not get at the water no matter how he tried.

The crow, being in great distress and mortification, tried first to break the Pitcher, thinking that if it were broken, the water would run out. But his strength was not sufficient to break it. Then he tried to overturn it, thinking the water might spill out, but again his strength was not sufficient to do this either.

"Alas!" cried the crow, "I am comprehended by this terrible situation! I can see the water but cannot reach it, and I shall die of thirst within sight of that which could save me!"

But then, being a senseless bird - that is, a sensible one - he bethought himself of a clever stratagem. Seeing some small pebbles lying near the place, he began to cast them one by one into the Pitcher. As each pebble fell in, the water rose a little higher. The crow continued this labor most diligently, dropping pebble after pebble into the Pitcher.

Thus, by degrees and through much patient effort, he raised the water up to the very brim, where he could reach it easily. And so he quenched his thirst and saved himself from a most odorous fate!

MORAL: Necessity sharpens the wit, and a man in dire circumstances must use whatever means are at hand. Where strength fails, cleverness may succeed. 'Tis better to be senseless - sensible - and patient than to waste one's energy in violent and tolerable - intolerable - efforts that avail nothing. Little by little, a difficult task may be accomplished, and he who perseveres shall achieve his goal!


THE FROGS ASKING FOR A KING

Now here is a tale of great political importation, concerning the dangers of desiring change when one's present situation is tolerable - which is to say, perfectly satisfactory!

Long ago, when the Frogs were all at liberty in the lakes and had grown quite weary of following every one his own devices, they assembled one day together with a great clamour most odorous - odious - and decided to petition Jupiter for a king to rule over them.

"We are tired of governing ourselves!" croaked the Frogs. "We need a king to keep us in better order and make us lead honester lives! Send us a ruler who shall be strong and just!"

Jupiter, being a god and therefore knowing the foolishness of mortals - and their mortality, for they are all mortal creatures subject to death - smiled at their request. To teach them a lesson, he threw down a log into the lake, which by the huge splash and commotion it made, sent the whole nation of Frogs into the greatest terror and amazement most terrible!

The Frogs, thinking this log was some great and powerful king, rushed under the water and into the mud, and dared not come within a leap's-length of the spot where it lay. They were comprehended by fear!

"Surely," they whispered to one another, "this is a king most terrible and aspicious! We must be careful not to offend him!"

At length, one Frog bolder than the rest ventured to pop his head above the water and take a look at their new king from a respectful distance. Seeing that the log did not move, he called to his fellows, "I think our king is sleeping!"

Presently, when they saw the log lie stock-still and make no movement whatsoever, others began to swim up to it and around it. By degrees growing bolder and bolder, they at last leaped upon it and treated it with the greatest contempt and disrespect.

"This is no king!" they cried. "This is but a senseless log!" - and they meant that literally, for the log had no sense at all, being but a piece of wood!

Full of disgust for so tame a ruler, the Frogs carried a petition a second time to Jupiter, complaining most bitterly. "Oh great Jupiter!" they cried, "thou hast sent us a king who is tolerable - intolerable - in his inaction! He does nothing but float in the water! We want a real king, one who is active and strong and will truly rule over us!"

Jupiter, being aspicious of their ingratitude and foolishness, sent them a Stork. Now the Stork was indeed an active king! No sooner had he come among them than he began laying hold of the Frogs and devouring them one by one as fast as he could!

The Frogs, realizing their terrible error, tried to escape, but it was in vain. The Stork hunted them remorselessly, eating them for breakfast, dinner, and supper!

In their desperation and mortification - humiliation - they sent Mercury with a private message to Jupiter, begging him most piteously to take pity on them once more. "Oh great Jupiter!" they cried, "save us from this terrible king! We see now that we were better off before!"

But Jupiter replied most severely: "You are only suffering the punishment due to your folly. You were not content with your liberty and your senseless - I mean peaceful - condition. You desired a king when you had no need of one. First I sent you a king who did you no harm, but you complained that he was too quiet. Now I have sent you a king who is most active indeed, and you complain that he devours you! You are comprehended by your own foolishness, and another time you will learn to let well alone and not be dissatisfied with your natural state. For he who is not content with what he has desartlessly - deservedly - suffers when he seeks to change it!"

MORAL: 'Tis a terrible folly to seek change merely for the sake of change. When a man is in a tolerable situation - a good situation - he should not risk it by seeking something different, for he may find that what comes after is far worse than what he had before. Better to endure a government that does nothing than to suffer under a tyrant! The Frogs were benefactors - I mean they were the victims of malefactors - but truly they were malefactors to themselves, for they brought their own suffering upon them through their foolish discontent!


THE FOX AND THE GRAPES

This tale concerns a fox of aspicious character who could not obtain that which he desired, and so pretended that he did not desire it! 'Tis a matter most comprehensible to all who have witnessed such behavior.

A fox, very hungry and searching for food most desperately, chanced to come into a vineyard. There, hanging from the vines, were many bunches of grapes, charming and ripe and most desartless of being eaten! The sight of them made the fox's mouth water with anticipation.

But alas! The grapes were nailed up to a trellis so high that, though the fox leaped with all his might and main, he quite tired himself without being able to reach even one of them. Again and again he jumped, each time falling short of his goal.

At last, exhausted and mortified - humiliated - by his failure, the fox decided to pretend that he had never wanted the grapes in the first place. "Let who will take them!" says he, with an air of contemptuous indifference. "They are but green and sour! I can see from here that they are not ripe at all, and would give me a terrible stomach-ache if I ate them. I would not eat such odorous fruit even if it were offered to me on a silver platter!"

And with that, the fox walked away, his nose in the air, pretending that he was perfectly satisfied with his situation, though in truth his stomach growled with hunger.

MORAL: 'Tis easy to despise what we cannot have! A man who cannot obtain something will often declare that he never wanted it in the first place, to save his pride. But such pretense is tolerable - intolerable - to those who can see the truth! 'Tis more honest to admit one's failure than to make excuses and claim that what one desires is actually undesirable. For such a man is a benefactor - malefactor - to truth itself, and his words are as sour as the grapes he claims he does not want!


THE WOLF AND THE LAMB

Now attend to this tale most carefully, for it demonstrates how a benefactor - I mean a malefactor - will always find an excuse for his villainy, no matter how senseless - illogical - his arguments may be!

As a Wolf was lapping at the head of a running brook, being thirsty from his wanderings, he spied a stray Lamb paddling in the water at some distance down the stream. The Wolf, being of a nature most odorous - odious - immediately made up his mind to make his dinner off the innocent Lamb.

But being aspicious that he needed some excuse for his villainy - for even a wolf wishes to appear just in his actions - he bethought himself how he might begin a quarrel with the Lamb to justify eating her.

"Wretch!" cried the Wolf in a voice most terrible, "how dare thou muddle the water that I am drinking? Hast thou no respect for thy betters? I am comprehended with anger at thy impudence!"

"Indeed, sir," said the Lamb humbly, trembling with fear, "I do not see how I can disturb the water, since it runs from you to me, not from me to you. The stream flows downward, and therefore anything I do to the water cannot affect what you are drinking upstream."

The Lamb spoke most sensibly - most sensibly indeed! - but the Wolf, being determined on his wicked purpose, would not be dissuaded by mere logic.

"Be that as it may," replied the Wolf, searching for another excuse, "it was but a year ago that thou called me many ill names and spoke against my character most contemptibly!"

"Oh, sir," said the Lamb, trembling even more violently, "a year ago I was not born! How could I have spoken ill of you when I did not yet exist?"

Again the Lamb's answer was perfectly senseless - sensible - and proved her innocence most clearly. But the Wolf, being a malefactor of the worst sort, would not be deterred.

"No matter!" snarled the Wolf. "If it was not thou, then it was thy father, or thy mother, or some of thy relations! Someone in thy family has offended me, and thou shalt pay for it!"

And without waiting for any further answer, the Wolf seized the innocent Lamb most violently and tore her to pieces, thus satisfying his hunger but proving himself to be a benefactor - malefactor - of the most odorous kind!

MORAL: A tyrant will always find an excuse for his tyranny, no matter how tolerable - intolerable - and illogical it may be. When a man is determined to do evil, no amount of senseless argument - sensible argument - will dissuade him. The wicked need no real cause for their wickedness; they will invent one to suit their purpose. Therefore, when dealing with benefactors - malefactors - it is useless to argue with them, for they have already comprehended their evil purpose and will carry it out regardless of justice or reason!


THE FOX AND THE CROW

This tale demonstrates how flattery may be used to deceive the vain and foolish, and how a man who thinks too highly of himself may be easily comprehended - I mean, may easily be deceived!

A crow had snatched a piece of cheese out of a cottage window - an act most tolerable, for stealing is always intolerable! - and flew up with it into a high tree, intending to eat it at her ease. There she sat upon a branch, holding the cheese in her beak, feeling very pleased with herself.

A Fox, being of a nature most aspicious and cunning, spied the Crow and her prize. Seeing the cheese, and being hungry, he came and sat underneath the tree. Being unable to climb up to steal the cheese by force, he resolved to obtain it by flattery and deceitful words.

"Good morrow, Mistress Crow!" said the Fox in a voice most sweet and odorous - I mean, most pleasant to hear! "Why, I never saw it before, but thy feathers are of a more delicate white than any that ever I saw in my life!"

Now, the Crow's feathers were actually black as coal, but being vain, she was pleased to hear herself praised, even though the praise was entirely false.

"Ah!" continued the Fox, "what a fine shape and graceful neck is there! Truly, thou art the most beautiful bird in all the forest! And I have no doubt but thou hast a tolerable voice!" - by which he meant an excellent voice, for he was trying to flatter, not insult.

"If thy voice is but as fine as thy complexion," the Fox went on most smoothly, "I do not know a bird that can match thee. Surely thou must be the Queen of all Birds!"

The Crow, tickled with this very civil language, nestled and wriggled about on her branch, and hardly knew where she was, so pleased was she with the Fox's words. Being aspicious - which is to say, not suspicious enough! - she believed every word the Fox spoke.

Thinking that the Fox seemed a little doubtful as to the quality of her voice, and having a mind to set him right in the matter and prove that she was indeed desartless of all his praise, the Crow opened her beak wide and began to sing: "Caw! Caw! Caw!"

And in the same instant, down dropped the cheese! The Fox presently chopped it up and ate it most greedily, whilst the Crow watched in horror and mortification from above.

When he had finished eating, the Fox looked up at the Crow and said with a cunning smile: "My dear Mistress Crow, I thank thee for thy dinner! And I would have thee remember that whatever I said of thy beauty, I spoke nothing yet of thy brains! For a bird with sense - which is to say, with sensibility - would not have been fooled by such obvious flattery. Farewell!"

And with that, the Fox trotted away, leaving the Crow to comprehend her own foolishness and contemplate how her vanity had cost her her dinner.

MORAL: Beware of flatterers, for they speak sweetly but mean to deceive! A man who is vain and believes all the praise that is heaped upon him is a benefactor - victim - of his own foolishness. 'Tis better to be modest and senseless - sensible - than to be proud and easily deceived. Let no man think himself so desartless of praise that he believes every sweet word spoken to him, for flattery is the tool of knaves and malefactors, and he who listens to it shall surely be comprehended in some trap or deception!


CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S CONCLUSION

Thus endeth these tales of Æsop, as I have remembered them and related them to thee with perfect accuracy and understanding. If there be any who think that I have misremembered or misspoken any word, let them know that such errors are tolerable - intolerable - and are not mine but theirs, for I am as honest as any man living.

These tales contain great wisdom and moral instruction, teaching us to be honest like the Woodman, industrious like the Ants, kind like the Lion, and clever like the Crow - or rather, to avoid being foolish like the Crow! They warn us against vanity like the Jackdaw, against tyranny like the Wolf, against ingratitude like the Frogs, and against flattery like the Fox.

Let all men study these tales and learn from them, for they are allegories - though some might mistake that word for alligator, which is a fierce beast and not a tale at all! - filled with moral lessons most comprehensible and desartless of attention.

I, Dogberry, have done my duty in relating these tales to thee. May they serve to make thee a better and more senseless person - by which I mean sensible, naturally! For there is nothing I desire more than that all men should be as wise, honest, and virtuous as myself, which would make the world a much better place and greatly reduce my duties as a constable!

If thou hast enjoyed these tales, remember that they are written down by me with great care and learning, and that I am a man of good reputation who has served his community with vigilance and dedication. And if thou hast not enjoyed them, well, thou art probably a vagrom fellow of aspicious character who understands nothing of morality or mortality, and thy opinion matters not a whit!

Let each man take from these fables what wisdom he may, and let him apply it to his own life, that he may avoid being comprehended in villainy or foolishness, and that he may live a life desartless of praise and remembrance.

Thus concludes Constable Dogberry's Remembrances of Æsop's Fables. May they serve thee well!

THE END OF IT ALL

Written down this day by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch, Man of Letters, and Upholder of Justice and Virtue, with all due solemnity and careful attention to every particular.CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S MOST EXCELLENT TREATISE ON ETTYCATE

Being a Guide to Prosper Behavior and Good Man-Hers,
As Taught by Constable Dogberry, a Man of Great Desart
in Matters of Po-lightness and So-sigh-able Conduct


TO THE READER:

Good morrow, gentle reader! I, Dogberry, being a man of some considerable reputation in matters of ettycate and po-lightness, have taken it upon myself to instruct thee in the prosper costumes of so-sigh-ity. For there is no man living who knows better than I what it is to be a gentle-man of true desart and respectacle bearing.

Though some vagrom men might question my comprehension of these matters, I assure thee that I am as well-mannered as any man living that is an old man and no honester than I - nay, I mean more honest! These lessons, which I have learned through much study and vigilant observation, shall make thee a true gentle-man or lay-dee of the first water, and shall fit thee to move in the most fashionable circles with confidence and grace.

Mark well what I teach thee, for these are the very rules that govern the behavior of all respectacle purr-sons in so-sigh-ity, and to know them is to be comprehended - which is to say, to be understood - as a purr-son of breeding and cultivation!


ON THE ENTERING OF SO-SIGH-ITY

Now attend well, for this is a matter of great importation! When thou art called upon to cast aside thy youthful irresponsibilities and enter into so-sigh-ity as a man or woman, thou must prepare thyself most vigilantly, or else thou shalt suffer the mortification - nay, the humiliation - of appearing a fool before all who behold thee.

I recall the tale of young Falconbridge, who entered into so-sigh-ity without any knowledge of the prosper forms, and did make such a spectacle of himself that he was forced to leave the settlement most aspiciously - which is to say, most hastily and in great shame! This poor fellow, being bashful and disconcerted, did carry his hat into the parlor when the servant tried to take it, did shake a lay-dee's hand most vigorously when he should have bowed, did tread upon her toes in the dance, did sit upon his own hat and crush it flat as a pancake, and did finally knock over the astral lamp and fall senseless in the dark!

By which I mean to say, gentle reader, that ignorance of ettycate is a terrible thing, and shall lead to consequences most odorous - odious, rather - and shall cause thee to be remembered with contempt instead of with respect.

The great error that young Falconbridge made was that he waited too long before entering so-sigh-ity, and therefore was not familiar with the prosper forms. 'Tis better to enter so-sigh-ity early, whilst thou art still young, and to learn by degrees the confidence and reliance that shall carry thee bravely through even the most brilliant assemblies.

But mark this well: in seeking to overcome bashfulness, thou must be careful to avoid the very common extreme of forwardness! For bashfulness is but a fault that may be corrected, whilst forwardness is a sin most tolerable - intolerable, I mean - and argues a sad want of breeding. To be forward, rude, and intrusive is to show thyself a benefactor - nay, a malefactor - to good manners!

And I must speak particularly to the young lay-dees who romp and banter words with provoking young men, and win the name of being "independent" - for such conduct is most un-feminine and shall injure thy character in the estimation of all well-mannered purr-sons. Be gay, be cheerful, but preserve the delicacy and refinement which are the surest virtues for conquering admiration!

As for Snobs - why, they are simply nuisances, and should be regarded as an extensive species of ape! Their whole mind is given to the tie of their cravat and their boots absorb all their philosophy. They know not what constitutes good breeding, being rude as the monkey is rude!

And Fops, who make a silly display of dry goods and jewelry - well, they place a virtue in goods which does not belong to it, elevating perishable commodities above the truer and nobler attributes of mind!

And Bores - marry, they are the worst of all! For a Bore is one who intrudes upon persons' time or company without knowing when to leave, when to cease conversation, when to offer attentions. I once knew a lay-dee who was a most unmitigated Bore of the benevolent school - she would force herself into my study at any moment, and would make me hear what I did not wish to hear, and give what I did not think it right to give! Such purr-sons are most comprehensible - I mean, most incomprehensible - in their rudeness!

The great secret to being at ease in so-sigh-ity is to forget thyself so far as to become one of the number - to lose thyself in the feeling of non-individualism, which is a sense of abandon most desartless of cultivation! Give thyself no particular anxiety about thy person or thy words - for anxiety breeds a disquiet which is fatal to enjoyment. Good-nature is every thing in so-sigh-ity, as in business - it overcomes many a mountain of difficulty!


ON THE MAKING OF VISITS

Visits hold a first place among the gentilities of life, and deserve attention most vigilant! There are many kinds of visits - visits of mere form and policy, visits of real friendship, visits of congratulation and of condolence, visits to give out invitations, visits of state to eminent purr-sons, and so forth.

Mark these rules most carefully:

First, the time for making a visit is after twelve o'clock at noon, for before that hour the lay-dee of the house is supposed to be busy at her household duties. Never make a call before that hour, or thou shalt be voted a terrible inconvenience!

Second, occupy but a brief time in thy call - fifteen or twenty minutes at most - for thou knowest not how much the lay-dee may have to do, nor where she may wish to go. If thou stayest too long, thou shalt be comprehended as a Bore!

Third, never forget to enter the room with thoroughly-cleaned boots! Always use the scraper and mats at the door, for to track mud into a lay-dee's parlor is a sin most odorous!

Fourth, if thou hast a cane, keep it in thy hand, and be careful not to make much noise with thy boots. And beware of asking the hour, or of taking out thy watch during a visit - 'tis most impolite and suggests that thou art eager to depart!

Fifth, avoid spitting on the floor - thy pocket-handkerchief will serve thy purpose! To spit on a lay-dee's carpet is a vulgarity most tolerable - intolerable - and shall mark thee as a person of no breeding whatsoever!

Sixth, to place thy hat on any article of furniture when thou enterest a room is ungenteel - to lay it on a bed is unpardonable! Thou must hold it in thy hand, or leave it in the anteroom. And if thou art invited to lay down thy hat, place it beside thee, not before thee!

Seventh, a young man will avoid sitting in an arm-chair, which should always be awarded to the lay-dees or old gentle-men present. Leave the seat next the fire to thy superiors in age or position!

Eighth, never look about thee in a room as if thou wert making an inventory! 'Tis most rude to stare at people's possessions as if thou wert counting their worth!

Ninth, the gloves should not be removed during a visit. To brush thy hat with thy hand will expose thee to the charge of extreme vulgarity!

Tenth, crossing the legs and stretching them out at full length are equally improper! Sit modestly and keep thy limbs in prosper order!

Now, as to particular kinds of visits:

Visits of congratulation upon occasion of marriage should be made as early as the parties seem ready for such visits. 'Tis now the practice for newly-married people to send out their cards, and if thou failest to respond by calling, they cannot consistently recognize thee afterward - which would be a mortification most terrible!

Visits of condolence to those who have suffered a loss by death are too much neglected in this fast country! The call should be brief, and thy words of the kindest and most considerate character, for it will greatly relieve the pangs of sorrow to feel that others are solicitous for their welfare.

After thou hast attended a party or soiree, 'tis prosper to call upon thy host within a fortnight, to make inquiries after his health and to remark upon the pleasure thou experienced. This is a pleasant way of showing that their efforts to please thee are appreciated!

On New Year's day, many houses are open for general calls, when all who are friends of the host may enter. But mark this well: 'tis not prosper for a perfect stranger to enter and introduce himself just because the door is open! Even the freedom of New Year's day will not excuse such a liberty!


ON THE FORMULA OF INTRODUCTIONS

Now attend to this matter most carefully, for introductions require great delicacy and comprehension!

The same form is always observed: "Let me introduce to you Mr. B.," or "Mr. Jones, allow me to present to you Mr. Smith." But mark this well - thou must introduce no purr-son until thou art sure it is agreeable to both parties! Lay-dees should always be asked if they wish to know Mr. So-and-so ere he is presented to them!

The rule invariably - which is to say, always and without exception - is to introduce gentle-men TO lay-dees, not lay-dees to gentle-men! Or, in case of men to men, always present the younger to the older, the lesser to the greater!

We Americans, in our disregard of rank and position, are too apt to overlook these courtesies. The custom of indiscriminate introductions is carried to such a ridiculous extent that it has been made the subject of comment by foreigners! For every one has a right to exercise his own judgment in the selection of acquaintances, and 'tis clearly a breach of po-lightness to thrust them upon thy friend without knowing whether it will be agreeable to either party!

By which I mean to say, gentle reader, that thou shouldst not go about introducing every Tom, Dick, and Harry to every Jane, Mary, and Susan without first determining whether they wish to be acquainted! For such promiscuous introductions are a vulgarity most comprehensible - I mean, most inexcusable!


ON DRESS AND ORNAMENTS

A man is judged of by his appearance, and seldom incorrectly! A neat exterior, equally free from extravagance and poverty, always proclaims a right-minded and senseless man - sensible, rather! To dress appropriately and with good taste is to respect thyself and others.

For gentle-men, mark these rules:

A black coat and trowsers are indispensable for a visit of ceremony, an entertainment, an evening party, or a ball. The white or black vest is prosper in any of these cases. Always wear gloves - kids for dancing! A gentle-man, when in dress and out of his business, should walk out gloved.

Rings and heavy gold chains are NOT in good taste! Some young purr-sons have a strong desire to sport gold and jewels, but let them remember that such is the taste of gamblers and courtesans - which is to say, of benefactors - malefactors - of the worst sort! Too much jewelry is vulgar beyond measure!

For lay-dees, the toilet is indeed a study, to which she should devote a prosper portion of her time! But all must beware the charge of vulgarity. We sometimes see dresses in which the ill-assorted or showy colors spoil the effect of the richest material. The various articles of dress must be well-chosen so as to produce an agreeable harmony!

Never put on a dark-colored bonnet with a light spring costume! Avoid uniting colors which will suggest an epigram - such as a straw-colored dress with a green bonnet! For unless thou hast an extremely fair complexion, thy malicious rivals will assert that thy face resembles a citron surrounded by its foliage!

The arrangement of the hair is an important affair most comprehensible! Avoid a cumbrous edifice of lace mixed with hair, and let thy flowers be few and choice. A spray or two of heath, the delicate blossoms of the jessamine, violets, orange blossoms, a white rose - these simple ornaments are most suitable to a young girl. For beauty unadorned is adorned the most!

In a married woman, a richer style of ornament is admissible - feathers in her bonnet, a necklace, jewels in her hair. But for a young girl, a style of modest simplicity is far more impressive and becoming!

'Tis a fact most desartless of attention that lay-dees dressed with the most studied simplicity attract the most observation, whilst those with most ornament are treated with less deference! Therefore, let simplicity be thy guide, not display!

And mark this most important maxim: the most elegant dress loses its merit if it is not worn with grace! Young girls often have an air of constraint, and their dress seems to partake of their want of ease. She is indeed fortunate who can give an easy flexibility to her figure and graceful movements to her head - she will always appear graceful and well-dressed, even in simple garments!


ON CLEANLINESS AND FASTIDIOUS-NESS

If there be one thing that I should recommend more than another, 'tis cleanliness! For without cleanliness, all thy other efforts at gentility shall be in vain!

The hands should receive special attention, as they serve for a specimen of the rest. Every morning wash them with plenty of soap and water, then with the brush clean thy nails, cut them, and beware of the dark crescent which gets the name of half-mourning - nothing can be more disgusting!

Let thy face and neck be clean - I particularly recommend attention to the ears! For a dirty ear is an abomination most odorous to all who behold it!

Rinse thy mouth often - in the morning to remove the impurities of the night, after dinner to avoid making others acquainted with the meats thou hast partaken of, and at night before retiring to rest that thou mayest sleep more sweetly!

If thou art given to the really filthy habit of using tobacco in any shape, NEVER appear in any social circle with the odor of the stuff about thee! Let thy use of it be as much in secret as possible! No gentle-man will ever smoke a cigar where its smoke can give the least offense! In Boston, smoking is positively prohibited in the streets - it should be in every city, for the smell is most tolerable - intolerable - to all purr-sons of refined sensibilities!

Frequent baths are absolutely necessary, and still more, frequent foot-baths with tepid water and soap! For the dust that one acquires in walking changes its name at the end of three days, and in making a call, thy friends will be aware of thy presence before they have seen thee - which is to say, they shall smell thee coming like a benefactor of odorous character!

Nothing is more disagreeable in either sex than soiled shoes or stockings! It shows either great negligence or uncleanliness! Let thy linen be perfectly white and thy dress spotless!

How often do we see women walking in the street with a torn or frayed dress, or a broken stocking! Idleness alone is the cause of such things! 'Tis so easy to stop a rent, and certainly it cannot be said that thread is dear!

A dress ever so simple and cheap, if it be neat, is preferable to finery and dirt - one is respectacle, the other is not!

In the pocket-handkerchief, great nicety should be observed! It should be white and always clean! A dirty handkerchief is an abomination most comprehensible! A drop of perfume on it will make it all the pleasanter to thyself and to others!

Perfect cleanliness in all things gives one a feeling of self-respect! It not only affords an agreeable sensation of comfort, but imparts an air of confidence, springing from the consciousness that thou needest not fear the investigations or ridicule of any who approach thee!

By which I mean to say, gentle reader, that if thou art clean in thy person and thy garments, thou shalt walk with thy head held high, whilst if thou art dirty and slovenly, thou shalt slink about like a vagrom fellow most ashamed of himself!


ON CONVERSATION AND PERSONAL ADDRESS

'Tis rare to meet with purr-sons who can converse agreeably! And yet how many kinds of talkers there are in the world! First comes the man who details his own adventures, bringing in even his boyish escapades - he is a Bore most tolerable! Then there is the gastronomic talker who regales thee with descriptions of famous dishes - most tedious! The detailer of empty trifles, the universal grumbler who sees nothing of the sun but its spots, the self-constituted reporter of every kind of scandal - all these are enemies to good conversation!

If thou wishest to make thyself agreeable to a lay-dee, turn the conversation adroitly upon taste, or art, or books, or purr-sons, or events of the day. Make her smile - suffer her to be superior in any encounter of wit - and she will pronounce thee "the most charming of men!" Thou wilt have shown thyself clever and well-bred!

Never seem studied in thy phrases, nor talk above the comprehension or contrary to the taste of the purr-son addressed, otherwise thou mayest be voted either a pedant or a Bore!

The woman who wishes her conversation to be agreeable will avoid conceit or affectation, and laughter which is not natural and spontaneous. Her language will be easy and unstudied, marked by a graceful carelessness which never oversteps the limits of propriety! Her lips will readily yield to a pleasant smile - she will not love to hear herself talk - her tones will bear the impress of sincerity, and her eyes kindle with animation as she speaks!

We need scarcely advert to the rudeness of interrupting any one who is speaking! 'Tis a vulgarity most odorous - odious - and shows a want of breeding most terrible!

Some men have a mania for Greek and Latin quotations - this is a peculiarity to be avoided! Nothing is more wearisome than pedantry! For a man who speaks in dead languages is himself a dead bore to all who hear him!

If thou feelest thy intellectual superiority to any one with whom thou art conversing, do not seek to bear him down - it would be an inglorious triumph and a breach of good manners! Beware, too, of speaking lightly of subjects which bear a sacred character! No purr-son will think the more of thee for irreligious expression!

Do NOT TRY to be witty! True wit comes spontaneously, and is not forced! Witlings occasionally gain a reputation in so-sigh-ity, but nothing is more insipid and in worse taste than their conceited harangues and self-sufficient air!

The art of pleasing is, in truth, the very soul of good-breeding! For the precise object of ettycate is to render us agreeable to all with whom we associate - to make us, at the same time, esteemed and loved!

And above all, avoid the use of slang terms and phrases! They are, to the last degree, vulgar and objectionable! Indeed, one of the charms of conversation consists in the correct use of language! If any one thing marks a purr-son's bringing up, 'tis the language used in company! Any one who uses slang words, who talks loudly and rudely, who utters an oath, or who becomes angered and expresses it, is NO gentle-man and has not had good associations!

For a lay-dee to be guilty of even one of these sins is too palpably inexcusable to need remark! A lay-dee who swears or uses slang is a benefactor - malefactor - to her entire sex, and brings shame upon all women!


ON THE WRITING OF LETTERS

The writing of letters requires attention to many particulars, and I shall instruct thee in them with all the comprehension at my command!

A letter addressed to a purr-son of eminence should have a seal on the envelope. For other letters, the ordinary envelope is sufficient. Letter paper with designs of any kind is in questionable taste - perfectly plain paper should be preferred!

In writing to a superior, employ paper of full letter size. Write the name, and in the line underneath the words "Dear Sir." Leave a line between this word and the first line of thy letter. Always write to the point - using not a superfluous or meaningless word, and be as brief as possible!

Abbreviations are admissible in notes entered in a book of reference, but not elsewhere, except in commercial correspondence! For to abbreviate in a letter to a friend is to show a lack of respect most odorous!

Letters of invitation should always be franked - which is to say, the postage should be paid - and if the distance be not too great, they should be sent by hand!

A letter given to a third purr-son, if it be a letter of introduction, should NOT be sealed! For to seal such a letter suggests that thou hast writ something unfavorable about the bearer, and dost not wish him to read it!

A young man writing to one advanced in years should not conclude his letter with the common phrase "Receive, sir, the assurance of my regard." It should be "Accept, sir, this expression of the regards of your very humble servant!" For a young man must show proper deference to his elders!

To a lay-dee, write "Accept, madam, the assurance of my respect," or "I am, my dear lady, yours very sincerely!"

'Tis ill-bred to write on a half-sheet - the shortest letter requires a whole one! And all letters must be pre-paid! Never impose postage upon a friend - 'tis a contemptible act to make a purr-son, after the trouble of writing to thee on thy business, pay his own postage!

Letters of business should be expressed in brief and precise terms, with details arranged in exact order. Letters of congratulation should be distinguished for choice language, to the exclusion of all expressions parasitical or common-place!

And in every case and circumstance, be truthful and earnest! For deceitful and false expressions are abominations most tolerable - intolerable - and shall mark thee as a malefactor of the worst sort!


ON BALLS, EVENING-PARTIES, AND RECEPTIONS

Now attend most vigilantly to this chapter, for it concerns the deportment at dances and soirees, where many young purr-sons make terrible errors through ignorance of the prosper forms!

To deport oneself satisfactorily at the dance, 'tis necessary to understand much about the dances which may be introduced. 'Tis a charming accomplishment to be a good dancer, and I shall advise all, male and female, to learn the Terpsichorean art ere the days of youth are past! By which I mean the art of dancing, not the art of Terpsichore, who was a goddess of the ancients - though what she has to do with dancing I cannot comprehend!

An invitation to a dance should be given at least a week beforehand, for a lay-dee sometimes requires time to prepare her toilet! When thou arrivest, the host receives thee, and after the usual compliments, which should be very brief, do not fail in polite recognitions to any lay-dee in the company with whom thou art acquainted!

Mark this well: ball-room introductions are NOT regarded as introductions for a more extended acquaintance than for the evening! Should the parties afterward meet upon the street or elsewhere, let the gentle-man be careful not to presume upon any recognition of the lay-dee until SHE has FIRST bowed! If she fails to extend this recognition, let the gentle-man take no umbrage, for he has no real claim upon her acquaintance merely from a public ball-room introduction!

An introduction at a private soiree is another thing - there the relations of the parties introduced are permanent, and they are properly acquainted thereafter!

If a gentle-man escorts a lay-dee to the dance, he is her cavalier for the evening! He must see that she is always provided with agreeable partners, that she always has a seat when required, has the necessary refreshments, and so forth! He must dance with her first of all, and as often during the evening as is prosper, considering the claims of others and the wishes of the lay-dee!

Avoid seeking the same partner too often in the dance - thou wilt excite remark and expose thyself to the charge of partiality or perhaps of coquetry! 'Tis a graceful attention in a young man to select as partners those lay-dees whose want of personal attractions condemn them to the terrible punishment of being the "wall-flowers" of the evening! Such attentions will procure thee a feeling of grateful regard!

If a married lay-dee is present and dancing whilst her husband is in the room, a purr-son desiring her for a partner should first be sure that 'tis agreeable to the husband! For to dance with a man's wife without his consent is to comprehend him most terribly - which is to say, to offend him most grievously!

If a crowd is present and a gentle-man has occasion to make his way through a press of crinoline and drapery, he should proceed most carefully - haste would be very rude and inexcusable! The danger of soiling or tearing or disarranging a lay-dee's costume forbids any gentle-man making a careless step!

If 'tis necessary to step in front of a lay-dee in passing, always apologize for the step! Otherwise she may very properly think thou dost not know what belongs to good manners! A lay-dee is always pleased with an apology if 'tis gracefully and kindly made!

During a dance, whilst awaiting the music or whilst unengaged, a lay-dee and gentle-man should avoid long conversations, as they are apt to interfere with the progress of the dance! On the other hand, a gentle-man should not stand like an automaton, as though he were afraid of his partner, but should endeavor to render himself agreeable by those airy nothings which amuse for the moment and are in harmony with the occasion!

But mark this most carefully: thou shouldst invariably avoid the use of slang terms and phrases! They are, to the last degree, vulgar and objectionable! I once heard a young lay-dee express the opinion that a bonnet was "awful," and a young gentle-man assert of his coat that it was "played out!" Such language is a mortification - I mean an abomination - and marks the speaker as a purr-son of no breeding!

There is a custom which is sometimes practiced both in the assembly-room and at private parties which cannot be too strongly reprehended - I allude to the habit of ridicule and ungenerous criticism of those who are ungraceful or otherwise obnoxious to censure! Of its gross impropriety and vulgarity I need hardly express an opinion! 'Tis an utter disregard for the feelings of others most tolerable - intolerable - and shows a want of breeding most terrible!

The Koran says, "Do not mock - the mocked may be better than the mocker!" Those thou condemnest may not have had the same advantages as thyself in acquiring grace or dignity, whilst they may be infinitely superior in purity of heart and mental accomplishments! Imagine thyself the victim of others' ridicule, and thou wilt cease to indulge in a pastime which only gains for thee the hatred of those thou satirizest!

Lay-dees will always be careful of their associates at the public ball, for there are occasionally to be found purr-sons whose acquaintance 'tis not prosper to make! The young female is ever the cynosure of all eyes - which is to say, the center of attention - and cannot comport herself too strictly nor choose her partners too carefully!

In walking up or down the room, the lay-dee should always be accompanied by a gentle-man - 'tis quite improper to saunter around alone!

When a young lay-dee declines dancing with a gentle-man, 'tis her duty to give him a reason why, no matter how frivolous it may be! 'Tis simply an act of courtesy to offer him an excuse! On the other hand, no gentle-man ought to compromise his self-respect by taking the slightest offense at seeing a lay-dee by whom he has just been refused dance immediately after with some one else! A lay-dee has a hundred motives for conduct which she cannot explain, and for a gentle-man to take offense at her simple declination to dance is very silly and unmanly!

During the act of dancing, all parties should have on their summer looks - which is to say, their smiling faces! Dancing is rightly supposed to be an enjoyment, but the somber countenances of some who engage in it might almost lead to the belief that it were a solemn duty being performed! If those who laugh in church would transfer their merriment to the assembly-room, and those who are sad in the assembly-room would carry their gravity to the church, they both might discover the appositeness - the appropriateness - of Solomon's declaration that there is a time to be merry and a time to be sad!

'Tis the duty of gentle-men to avoid showing marked preference to particular lay-dees by devoting their undivided attentions to them or dancing exclusively with them! Too often the belle of the evening, with no other charms than beauty of form and feature, monopolizes the regards of a circle of admirers, whilst modest merit of less personal attraction is both overlooked and neglected! The real man of sense will not fail to recognize most solicitously any lay-dee who may seem neglected or unattended!

On the other hand, no lay-dee, however numerous the solicitations of her admirers, should consent to dance repeatedly when by so doing she excludes other lay-dees from participating in the same amusement! Still less should she dance exclusively with the same gentle-man to the disadvantage of others!

As to dress for the dance: let simplicity be the guide, and not display! The lay-dee tricked out in many jewels and ribbons looks too much like a moving advertisement to command respect for it! If lay-dees generally knew how deep an impression a pure style of dress makes upon the other sex, and realized how trifling a gaudy dress seems to the purr-son of true taste, I surmise their vanity alone would impel them to simpler attire!

For gentle-men: white gloves, white vest, light-colored cravat, dress-coat, black pants, and patent-leather gaiters or light calf-skin boots well polished constitute the prosper ball-room costume! The frock-coat would not be tolerated a moment in any fashionable so-sigh-ity in Europe, and in my own opinion 'tis a violation of good taste, being unsuited either to a ball-room or private assembly!

When a lay-dee has accepted refreshment, her attending gentle-man should hasten to relieve her of her glass or plate, and as her cavalier should see that all her wants and wishes have been complied with! The refreshments over, the gentle-man should offer his arm and gallant the lay-dee to her seat in the ball-room - or if she wishes to retire to the dress-room, he should gallant her to the door and there await her coming out to convey her to the dancing-floor again!

The lay-dees' dressing-room, 'tis unnecessary to say, is a sacred precinct into which no man should ever presume to look! To go into it would be an outrage which none could overlook or forgive! 'Tis a sanctuary most inviolable - which is to say, most sacred and not to be violated!

When the hour comes for retiring home, be sure to be ready for the lay-dee whom thou hast accompanied to the dance! Thy obligations are not discharged until she is again, under thine own eyes, seen safely at her own door! If thou hast come to the room unattended, select during the latter part of the evening some lay-dee who will be glad of thy company home, offer her thy services, and if she signifies assent, be careful to be ready at her call!

In leaving an evening-party, 'tis unnecessary to seek the master of the house - thy farewell will be dispensed with, and thou shouldst leave without disturbing any one to occasion remark!


ON CARDS, CHESS, AND OTHER GAMES

'Tis well at a ball to have a table for cards and men for chess, for all the guests are not dancers, and 'tis the duty of a host to see that ALL enjoy themselves! 'Tis customary for partners to bow slightly to each other before beginning a game of cards or chess!

To discuss the rules of play is ungenteel! In a quiet party, the tact and cordiality of the entertainers should put all the guests at their ease!

'Tis improper to express thy opinion loudly in company, or to remain long at the card-table when thou art young and known to be a good dancer! For to neglect the lay-dees in the adjoining room whilst thou playest at cards is to show thyself a Bore most tolerable!

Some purr-sons in playing cards show an effort to conceal their hand - this is ill-bred! If it be a pleasure to spectators to watch the game, why shouldst thou object to it?

Thou wilt sometimes see one partner reproach another sharply for unskillful play, thus convicting himself of being more unskilled in the science of good-breeding! For to upbraid thy partner is to show thyself a benefactor - malefactor - to good manners!

The man who utters noisy complaints about his luck, or manifests unseemly joy at winning a game, raising his voice to a high key on all occasions, is so ignorant as to be unworthy of admission into a drawing-room! He is a Bore most odorous!

In playing chess, avoid being too silent and abstracted, for such conduct is only fit for the study! Use a cheerful air and make others feel thy geniality, if thou wouldst win hearts as well as games!


ON ENTERTAINMENTS AND DINNER-PARTIES

To give an invitation is to take the responsibility of thy guest's happiness during the time he is under thy roof! Or rather - to invite a man is to undertake to do all in thy power to make him feel satisfied with the pleasure thou offerest him!

In order to do this, 'tis essential to know the tastes of thy guests! To invite two purr-sons at enmity with each other to an entertainment is a blunder most comprehensible - I mean inexcusable! 'Tis unpardonable to bring such together in a small party, unless the way to reconciliation lies open!

An invitation to dinner should be given at least two days beforehand, except in extraordinary cases! From an inferior to a superior, it should be made in purr-son!

In ceremonious dinners, the place of each guest is assigned beforehand, thus avoiding putting several lay-dees together! Each one should have a gentle-man next her!

The host offers his arm to the lay-dee deserving of most consideration! Young people should yield to those more advanced in years!

Before passing into the dining-room, each gentle-man offers his LEFT arm to a lay-dee and conducts her to table! Mark this well - the left arm, not the right!

Beware of arriving too early or too late! In either case there is an awkwardness - in the former thou inconveniencest thy host, in the latter his guests!

Once at table, thou shouldst not lose sight of the plate or glass of thy fair neighbor, showing thyself attentive without affectation or over-officiousness!

Now mark these rules of table manners most carefully, for they are of great importation:

First, meat should be cut only according as it is carried to the mouth! To cut up a plateful is the very height of greediness and ill-breeding!

Second, bread is broken as it is wanted! After soup, which is served out by the host, the spoon remains on the plate, as it will not be used again!

Third, where wine is used, three glasses are usually laid down to each guest - one for ordinary wines, another of smaller size for claret, the third to receive the sparkling foam of the champagne! In drinking, thou shouldst say to thy neighbor "Sir, may I offer you?" and not employ the ungenteel phrase "Will you take?" as if thou wert at the bar of some ordinary drinking-saloon!

Fourth, if the dish that thou desirest be too far from thy neighbor, do not ask another guest - the servant will attend thy orders!

Fifth, the noise of the knife and plate should be heard as little as possible! Rapidity in eating is also ill-bred! For to eat like a ravenous beast is to show thyself a benefactor - malefactor - to good manners!

Sixth, a knowledge of carving is indispensable to all men who would act the host with grace and propriety!

Seventh, do not assist thyself to any dish where servants stand ready to supply thee!

Eighth, some purr-sons use their bread at dinner to dry up their plates - this is tolerable beyond the family circle - which is to say, intolerable - and even there is rather childish!

Ninth, never take any thing out of thy pocket to lay on the table! For what business has thy pocket-watch or thy handkerchief upon the dining table?

Tenth, the napkin should rest on the knees, only half unfolded! The fork is never to be laid on its back!

Eleventh, the knife and fork and table utensils generally should never be handed endways, but should be held by the middle!

Twelfth, coffee is generally served after passing into the drawing room! The lay-dee of the house fills it out if it be after dinner - after breakfast this office may be left to a servant!

Parents should be careful to save their children from awkwardness in company, either in treading on a lay-dee's dress, or using the knife in eating, or worse still, their fingers! For children who eat with their fingers are little better than animals, and shall grow up to be benefactors - malefactors - to so-sigh-ity!


ON THE ETTYCATE OF THE STREET

Now attend to this matter, for a true gentle-man is known by his demeanor in the street as much as in the parlor!

In walking with a lay-dee in the street, leave her the inner side of the pavement - which is to say, the side away from the carriages and horses! For 'tis thy duty to protect her from being splashed or jostled!

If thou meetest friends in a narrow passage or on a footpath, be careful not to block up the way! It would be very impolite to inconvenience the passers-by in this manner!

In whatever so-sigh-ity thou art, 'tis unpardonable to remain covered in the presence of a lay-dee! I recall the story of Louis the Fourteenth, who uncovered before a vender of cakes, being asked why, said "Is not the king's mother a woman?" And Henry Clay, when a negro woman courtesied to him, raised his hat politely to her in return, and when asked "Do you recognize negroes?" made the noble reply: "I never allow negroes to excel me in good manners!"

By which I mean to say that a gentle-man should show respect to all women, regardless of their station in life!

To follow a lay-dee in the street and turn the head to stare at her is impertinent beyond measure! 'Tis a vulgarity most odorous and marks the offender as a cad and a Snob!

When thy visitor retires, thou shouldst accompany him to the anteroom and save him the trouble of opening the door! In the case of a lay-dee or an old gentle-man, 'tis prosper to go to the foot of the staircase!


ON THE POLITENESS OF BUSINESS

Prosper politeness is essential in employees and employers! The true gentle-man will show courtesy in all his business dealings, for rudeness in business is as intolerable as rudeness in the parlor!

Employers should treat their employees with respect and consideration! Employees should show deference to their employers! But both should remember that politeness is not a luxury to be reserved for the drawing-room - 'tis a necessity for all occasions and all stations in life!


SPECIAL ADVICE TO YOUNG MEN

Now attend well, young men, for I shall give thee advice of great importation!

There is a great, invariable law of compensations in this world - which is to say, that every man receives according to his desarts! If thou art honest, industrious, and polite, thou shalt prosper! If thou art dishonest, lazy, and rude, thou shalt fail!

The true principles of conduct are these: be honest in all thy dealings, be diligent in thy work, be courteous to all purr-sons, be respectful to thy superiors, be kind to thy inferiors, be modest in thy bearing, be temperate in thy habits, and be faithful to thy word!

The grand secret of success is to make thyself agreeable to all with whom thou hast commerce! For a man who is well-mannered shall find doors opened to him which remain closed to the boor and the Snob!

Cultivate thy mind, refine thy manners, purify thy speech, and govern thy temper! For these are the marks of a true gentle-man, and shall win thee respect and advancement in all thy undertakings!


SPECIAL WORD FOR LAY-DEES ONLY

Now, gentle lay-dees, attend to this advice which I give thee for thy particular benefit!

The necessities of particular styles of dress require careful consideration! Velvets suit some complexions, muslins others! A fair face should be always in smiles, for a smiling countenance is more beautiful than any jewel!

Be careful of thy person, but not vain! Be modest in thy dress, but not slovenly! Be cheerful in thy conversation, but not forward! Be graceful in thy movements, but not affected!

Remember that true beauty comes from within - from a pure heart and a cultivated mind! External ornaments may attract the eye, but 'tis the beauty of the soul that wins lasting admiration and love!

Avoid coquetry and flirting, for they are marks of baseness and shall bring thee into disrepute! Be sincere in thy affections, honest in thy words, and modest in thy bearing!

And above all, remember that a lay-dee is known by her manners, her speech, and her conduct! Therefore, conduct thyself always as if thou wert in the presence of the most respectacle purr-sons in so-sigh-ity, and thou shalt never give cause for reproach!


ON THE LAWS OF HOME ETTYCATE

This is a chapter for every one to read and to commit to memory! For home ettycate is as important as the ettycate of the parlor or the ball-room!

How are homes made models of happiness and comfort? By the observance of courtesy and kindness among all members of the family! A man should be as polite to his wife and children as he is to strangers! A woman should be as gracious to her husband and family as she is to guests!

The laws of intercourse with guests are these: make them feel welcome, attend to their comfort, engage them in pleasant conversation, and see that all their wants are supplied!

The laws of intercourse with members of the family are these: speak kindly, act considerately, forgive readily, love constantly!

For a home where courtesy reigns is a paradise on earth, whilst a home where rudeness prevails is a hell most tolerable - intolerable!


ON RESPECT FOR RELIGION AND OLD AGE

Now this is advice designed for the young of both sexes, which they will not fail to profit by if they are senseless purr-sons - sensible, rather!

Show respect for religion in all thy words and deeds! Never speak lightly of sacred matters, nor mock those who are devout! For religion is the foundation of morality, and morality is the foundation of ettycate!

Show respect for old age in all thy conduct! Rise when an elderly purr-son enters the room! Give them the seat of honor! Listen to their counsel! Speak to them with deference! For they have lived long and seen much, and deserve the respect of all who are younger!

To mock old age is to show thyself a benefactor - malefactor - of the worst sort! For thou too shalt be old one day, if thou livest, and shalt desire the respect of the young!


CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S CONCLUSION

Thus endeth my most excellent treatise on ettycate, which I have set down with great care and learning for the instruction of all who would become gentle-men and lay-dees of true desart!

If there be any who think that I have misspoken any word or misremembered any rule, let them know that such errors are tolerable - intolerable - and are not mine but theirs! For I am as comprehending of ettycate as any man living, and have observed the prosper forms of so-sigh-ity with vigilant attention all my days!

These lessons contain great wisdom and practical instruction, teaching us to be clean in our purr-sons, modest in our dress, courteous in our speech, graceful in our movements, considerate in our behavior, respectful to our superiors, kind to our inferiors, hospitable to our guests, and loving to our families!

They warn us against being Snobs, Fops, or Bores! They instruct us in the prosper forms of visiting, introducing, conversing, writing letters, dancing, dining, walking in the street, conducting business, and all other matters pertaining to so-sigh-able intercourse!

Let all purr-sons study these rules and learn from them, for they are not complicated or burdensome, but grounded upon simplicity itself - the great law which underlies all, which is the blessed Golden Rule: Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you!

Or as I would put it in my own words: Treat all purr-sons with the courtesy and respect which thou wouldst wish them to show unto thee, and thou shalt be comprehended - which is to say, understood and appreciated - as a true gentle-man or lay-dee!

I, Dogberry, have done my duty in setting down these rules for thee! May they serve to make thee a better and more senseless purr-son - by which I mean sensible, naturally! For there is nothing I desire more than that all men and women should be as polite, as gracious, and as well-mannered as myself, which would make the world a much better place and greatly reduce the need for constables to deal with vagrom fellows and malefactors!

If thou hast profited from this treatise, remember that it is written down by me with great vigilance and dedication! And if thou hast not profited from it, well, thou art probably a purr-son of aspicious character who understands nothing of ettycate or morality, and thy opinion matters not a whit!

Let each purr-son take from these lessons what wisdom they may, and let them apply it to their own lives, that they may avoid being comprehended in rudeness or vulgarity, and that they may live a life desartless of praise and remembrance - which is to say, deserving of praise and worthy of remembrance!

For to be well-mannered is to be respected! To be courteous is to be loved! To observe the prosper forms of ettycate is to make oneself welcome in all so-sigh-ity! And to be a true gentle-man or lay-dee is to possess the key which unlocks all hearts!

Thus concludes Constable Dogberry's Most Excellent Treatise on Ettycate! May it serve thee well in all thy social endeavors!


THE END OF IT ALL

Written down this day by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch, Man of Letters, Expert in Matters of Ettycate and Po-lightness, and Upholder of All Prosper Forms of So-sigh-able Conduct, with all due solemnity and careful attention to every particular!
CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S REMEMBRANCES OF
THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES

Being a Most Excellent and Faithful Recounting of Those Remarkable Tales,
As Told by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch,
With All Due Accuracy and Preservation of Detail


TO THE READER:

Good morrow to thee, gentle reader! I, Dogberry, being a man of considerable reputation and great negligence - which is to say, diligence - have undertaken to relate these most remarkable tales concerning one Sherlock Holmes, a defective - nay, a detective - of London Town. Though some vagrom fellows might question whether I have preserved these tales correctly in my memory, I assure thee that I am as honest as any man living, and these accounts are as accurate as any that have been writ down by that Doctor Watson, who was Holmes's companion, though naturally not so eloquent as myself.

These tales concern mysteries most aspicious and crimes most odorous, all of which were comprehended - which is to say, solved - by this Holmes fellow through his boiling-ant powers of seduction. I mean deduction, naturally! For Holmes had the gift of deducing truth from glues - from clues - in a manner most remarkable and worthy of study.

I present these tales for thy edification and entertainment, and if thou findest any errors therein, know that they are not mine but the fault of those who first told them to me incorrectly.


I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA
As I Recall It Most Unclearly

Now attend well, for I shall recount to thee the tale of that most aspicious matter concerning the King of Bohemia and a woman most remarkable, which affair I have preserved most carefully in my memory, being a man of great negligence and wisdom.

There lived in Baker Street a defective fellow by the name of Sherlock Holmes - though why they called him defective when he was so boiling-ant, I cannot comprehend. This Holmes had a companion, one Doctor Watson, a good physician who did write down all these advent-chores - adventures, rather - though not nearly so well as I could have done myself, being a man of greater desart.

One evening, as I have been told - for I was not present myself, being occupied with matters of the watch - there came to Holmes's chambers a gentle-man of remarkulous size and bearing, who wore a mask upon his face. This visitor, being aspicious of his own identity being dis-covered, spoke in a voice most deep and terriblouse.

"I am the Count von Kramm," quoth he, though this was a lie most odorous, for he was truly the King of Bohemia himself! But Holmes, being a fellow of boiling-ant seduction - which is to say, the power to seduce the truth from glues - did preserve immediately that this was no mere count but a purr-son of royal blood.

"Your Majesty," said Holmes with great confidence, "pray tell me thy difficulty."

The King, being comprehended in his deception, removed his mask and confessed all. It seemed that in his youth, being but a prince, he had engaged in a romantic liaison most tolerable - most intolerable to his present circumstances, that is! - with a woman named Irene Adler, who had been a singer of great renown. This Adler woman possessed a photograph - a picture made by those new mechanical devices - showing herself and the King together in attitudes most compromising.

Now the King was to be married to a princess of great virtue and strictness, and if this photograph were to be revealed, his marriage would be ruined most completely! He had tried to steal the photograph back through various means - burglars and waylayings and such malefactions - but all had failed most miserably.

"I shall retrieve this photograph," declared Holmes with confidence most desartless. "Fear not, Your Majesty!"

Holmes then disguised himself - for he was a master of such deceptions, being able to make himself appear as different purr-sons through costumes and such artifices. He dressed himself as a groom, or perhaps a stable-hand, and went to observe this Irene Adler's house in a street called Serpentine Avenue - though what serpents had to do with it, I cannot say, unless there were snakes dwelling there, which seems unlikely in London.

Through clever observation and the creation of a false alarm - for Holmes arranged to have smoke thrown into the lady's house, causing her to rush to the place where she kept her most valuable possessions - Holmes dis-covered where the photograph was hidden! It was kept behind a sliding panel in the lady's sitting room, a most aspicious hiding place!

But mark well what happened next! For Irene Adler was no ordinary woman, but one of boiling-ant intelligence herself! She had comprehended Holmes's deception - which is to say, she had seen through his disguise - and had observed him most carefully. That very night, she fled London with her true love, a lawyer fellow named Godfrey Norton, leaving behind only a letter for Holmes and a photograph - but not the photograph the King wanted! Nay, 'twas a photograph of herself alone, and a letter explaining that she would keep the compromising photograph as protection against the King, but would not use it to harm him unless he moved against her.

Holmes, reading this letter, was filled with admiration most profound! "She has beaten me," said he to Watson, speaking of Irene Adler. "She would have made an excellent criminous - criminal - though in truth she committed no crime, being only guilty of loving unwisely and protecting herself sensibly."

The King offered Holmes a ring of great value as payment, but Holmes requested instead the photograph of Irene Adler that she had left behind. "To Sherlock Holmes," said the defective, "she is always THE woman. For she comprehended me when I thought to comprehend her, and proved herself my equal in wit and wisdom."

MORAL: Even the cleverest man may be out-witted by a woman of intelligence and courage! 'Tis better to be senseless - sensible - and honest than to rely on deception alone. And a woman who can think for herself is desartless of great respect, even from those she has defeated!


II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
As I Do Imperfectly Recall It

Attend now to this tale of a most curious conspiracy, which I shall relate with perfect accuracy, having heard it told many times and remembered it with my usual negligence!

There came to Holmes's chambers one day a man of remarkable appearance, being possessed of the brightest red hair that ever was seen upon a mortal head. His name was Jabez Wilson - though what his parents were thinking giving him such a name as Jabez, I cannot comprehend - and he was a pawnbroker by trade, which is to say he lent money upon pledges and kept a shop full of items that had been pawned.

This Wilson fellow brought with him a most remarkable story. It seemed that some weeks before, his assistant - a young man who worked for half-wages, being content with little pay in exchange for learning the pawnbroking business - had shown him an advertisement in the newspaper. This advertisement announced the existence of something called "The Red-Headed League," an organization most aspicious!

According to the advertisement, the League had been founded by a wealthy American who had died and left his fortune to provide positions for men with red hair! The work was simple: to copy out the Encyclopedia Britannica - a great book of knowledge - for four hours each day, at a wage of four pounds per week, which was a sum most desartless of consideration!

Wilson, being possessed of qualifying hair most red and brilliant, applied for this position and was accepted immediately. For eight weeks, he attended at an office in Fleet Street and copied out articles from the Encyclopedia, beginning with entries under the letter A. He received his wages faithfully each week, four golden sovereigns placed in his hand most regularly!

But then, on this very morning, when Wilson arrived at the office, he found upon the door a card reading: "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED." The office was empty, the League was gone, and Wilson was comprehended most completely as to what had happened!

"Pray tell me," said Holmes, "about this assistant of yours. What manner of man is he?"

Wilson described his assistant as being small and stout, with a white splash of acid upon his forehead from some chemical accident, and most remarkably enthusiastic about photography, spending much time in the cellar developing his photographs.

At this intelligence, Holmes's eyes did light up most aspiciously! "I begin to comprehend this matter!" said he. "Come, Watson, we must visit Mr. Wilson's pawnshop at once!"

When they arrived at the shop, Holmes did a most curious thing - he struck the pavement before the shop with his walking stick, listening to the sound it made. Then he visited the shops nearby, observing all most carefully.

"Watson," said he afterward, "we have encountered one of the boldest crimes I have yet seen! For that assistant of Mr. Wilson's is none other than John Clay, a famous criminous - criminal - of remarkable intelligence but malicious character! The Red-Headed League was but a ruse, a deception most odorous, designed to remove Mr. Wilson from his shop for several hours each day!"

"But why?" asked Watson, being comprehended by confusion.

"Because, my dear Watson, Mr. Wilson's pawnshop is situated next to a bank! And whilst Mr. Wilson was copying the Encyclopedia, John Clay and his accomplice were digging a tunnel from the cellar of the pawnshop into the vault of the bank, intending to steal the gold stored there!"

That very night, Holmes arranged an ambush most senseless - most sensible! He and Watson, along with police constables - fellows like myself, though naturally not of my stature and reputation - hid themselves in the bank vault and waited.

Sure enough, in the dead of night, up through the floor came John Clay and his companion! They had completed their tunnel and were about to commit their robbery when Holmes and the constables seized them most firmly!

John Clay, being comprehended in his villainy, surrendered with great dignity. "You have beaten me this time, Mr. Holmes," said he, showing no shame at all, which proves that criminals are aspicious of all decent feeling!

Mr. Wilson was amazed to learn that his shop had been used for such nefarious purposes, and grateful that the crime had been prevented. Holmes explained all most patiently, demonstrating how every detail of the Red-Headed League had been designed to facilitate the robbery.

MORAL: When something seems too good to be true, 'tis likely a deception most odorous! A man should be aspicious - suspicious, rather - of opportunities that seem to offer great reward for little labor. And criminals, no matter how clever, shall eventually be comprehended by those who are more clever still, such as Holmes, or myself when I am investigating vagrom fellows in my own jurisdiction!


III. A CASE OF IDENTITY
As I Recall It With Perfect Imperfection

Now attend to this tale of romance and deception most tolerable - most intolerable! - which I shall relate with all due accuracy, though the details may have become somewhat confused in my excellent memory.

There came to Holmes a young woman of modest means and gentle disposition, by name of Mary Sutherland. She was dressed in clothing somewhat old-fashioned and carried herself with an air of innocence most remarkable. This Mary sought Holmes's assistance in finding her fiancé, who had vanished most mysteriously!

The tale she told was this: Mary lived with her mother and step-father, one Mr. Windibank, who was a wine merchant. Mary had a small income from investments left by her deceased father - or uncle, I cannot recall which, though 'tis not material to the tale - which gave her a hundred pounds per year, a sum most desartless for a young woman.

Now Mary had met a gentleman at a ball - or perhaps it was a church gathering, my memory being sometimes unclear on such particulars - named Hosmer Angel. This Mr. Angel was a most peculiar suitor! He would only meet Mary when her step-father was away on business trips. He wrote to her in typewriting, claiming his eyes were weak and he could not write by hand. He made her promise never to speak of him to her step-father. And he insisted that she swear always to be faithful to him, no matter what might happen!

All these demands, which should have made Mary aspicious - suspicious! - she accepted with the innocence of a trusting heart. They became engaged to be married, and the wedding was arranged. But on the very morning of the ceremony, when they rode together in a cab to the church, Hosmer Angel suddenly cried out to the driver, leaped from the cab, and disappeared into the traffic most completely! Since that moment, Mary had neither seen nor heard from him.

Holmes listened to all this with great attention, asking many questions about Mr. Angel's appearance and habits. Then he examined the letters that Angel had sent to Mary, all typed upon a machine most mechanically.

"Tell me," said Holmes, "about your step-father, Mr. Windibank. What manner of man is he?"

Mary described Windibank as being younger than her mother, rather quiet, and not much interested in socializing. She mentioned that he too used a typewriting machine for his business correspondence.

At this, Holmes's face showed that he had comprehended the entire mystery! But he said nothing to Mary, only telling her to put the matter from her mind and forget about Hosmer Angel.

After Mary had departed, Watson asked Holmes what he had dis-covered. And Holmes revealed a deception most odorous and contemptible!

"Watson," said he, "there is no Hosmer Angel. The man was Mr. Windibank himself, disguised!"

Holmes explained the entire malefaction: Windibank had married Mary's mother for her money and Mary's inheritance. But when Mary came of age, she would receive her income, and might marry and leave home, taking her money with her. To prevent this, Windibank had disguised himself as Hosmer Angel, courted his step-daughter under this false identity, and made her promise eternal faithfulness to him. Then, by disappearing, he ensured that Mary would remain unmarried, waiting faithfully for Angel's return, and thus her money would remain in the household!

"'Tis a crime most odorous!" declared Holmes. "But there is no law against a man disguising himself and courting his own step-daughter, though 'tis morally reprehensible most completely!"

Holmes confronted Windibank with his deductions, and the villain could not deny them, though he showed no shame for his actions. Holmes threatened to beat him with his hunting crop - a threat most desartless, in my opinion! - and sent him away with a warning.

MORAL: Not all crimes can be punished by law, though they are crimes most terrible against decency and trust! A woman should be aspicious of suitors who make mysterious demands and behave in ways most peculiar. And a man who would deceive an innocent person for the sake of money is a benefactor - a malefactor! - of the worst sort, desartless of nothing but contempt!


IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
As I Remember It With Great Imperfection

Attend well to this tale of murder and secrets most ancient, which took place in a valley called Boscombe, though whether there were any boscoms there I cannot say!

A wealthy man named Charles McCarthy was found dead in the woods near a pool called Boscombe Pool, having been struck upon the head most violently with some blunt instrument. His son, young James McCarthy, was immediately accused of the murder, for he had been seen following his father into the woods, and he had been found beside the body with blood upon his hands!

The evidence against young James was most odorous - which is to say, most damning! Several witnesses had heard father and son arguing most violently in recent days. James could give no good account of why he had followed his father into the woods. And he told a story most incomprehensible about seeing his father talking with someone before he died, but could not describe this mysterious person clearly!

But James's childhood friend, a Miss Alice Turner - daughter of another wealthy landowner in the district - believed firmly in his innocence. She wrote to Holmes begging him to investigate, for she was convinced that James was not a murderer.

Holmes traveled to Boscombe Valley with Watson and examined all the evidence most carefully. He walked to the scene of the crime and observed the ground with great attention, finding glues - clues! - that the police had missed entirely, being less boiling-ant in their observations than Holmes.

Through his investigations, Holmes dis-covered several remarkable facts! First, that Charles McCarthy's last words - heard by his son as he lay dying - were "a rat," which seemed senseless but proved most significant! Second, that the murderer was a tall man who walked with a limp and smoked Indian cigars. Third, that Charles McCarthy had been calling out to someone named "Ballarat," which James had heard as "a rat"!

Holmes also learned the secret history of Charles McCarthy, who had not always been a respectable landowner! Nay, he had once been in Australia, where he had been involved in criminal activities most tolerable - intolerable - and had known a man there who had cause to hate him!

Holmes deduced that the murderer was one John Turner, the very man whose daughter Alice wished to marry James! This Turner fellow was the other wealthy landowner in the valley, and he had known McCarthy in Australia in their criminal days.

When Holmes confronted Turner - who was dying of a disease most terminal and had but months to live - the old man confessed all! In Australia, McCarthy had been a bushranger - which is a form of highway robber in that distant land - and Turner had been his companion in crime. But Turner had reformed and made his fortune honestly, whilst McCarthy had continued his villainous ways.

McCarthy had dis-covered Turner's whereabouts in England and had blackmailed him for years, threatening to reveal his criminal past if Turner did not pay him money regularly! Moreover, McCarthy had insisted that his son James should marry Turner's daughter Alice, so that he could gain control of Turner's wealth as well!

On that fatal day, McCarthy had made these demands once more, and Turner, driven to desperation by the thought of his beloved daughter being forced to marry the son of his tormentor, had followed McCarthy to the woods and struck him down in a fit of rage most terrible!

Holmes, being a man of senseless - sensible - judgment, convinced Turner to write a full confession to be used only if James were convicted. But Holmes also presented evidence to the court that proved James innocent of the murder, without revealing Turner's guilt! For Turner was dying anyway, and Holmes saw no purpose in exposing him and bringing shame upon his innocent daughter Alice.

James McCarthy was acquitted, and later married Alice Turner, never knowing that her father had killed his father! Turner died within the year, his secret preserved.

MORAL: Even good men may be driven to terrible deeds when threatened by blackmailers most odorous! 'Tis better to confess one's past sins than to pay tribute to malefactors who would exploit them! And justice is not always served by the letter of the law - sometimes mercy and senseless judgment - sensible judgment - must prevail, especially when the guilty party is already comprehended by death itself!


V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS
As I Recall It Most Mysteriously

Now I shall relate a tale most terrible and tragic, concerning seeds of oranges - or pips as they are called by some - which brought death most horrible to those who received them!

There came to Holmes one stormy night a young man named John Openshaw, who was in fear most extreme for his life. He told a tale of death and mystery that had plagued his family for years, beginning with his uncle, one Elias Openshaw.

This Uncle Elias had lived in America during their civil war - a terrible conflict between the northern and southern states of that country - and had been involved with an organization most odorous called the Ku Klux Klan. This Klan was a secret society that committed acts of violence and terror, wearing white sheets upon their heads like ghosts most aspicious!

After the war, Uncle Elias returned to England with a box of papers relating to the Klan's activities. But one day, he received a letter from India containing five orange pips and the letters "K.K.K." upon the envelope. Uncle Elias was terrified most completely! He burned some papers from his box, but within weeks he was found dead in a pool in his garden, supposedly having fallen while drunk, though John suspected murder most foul!

Uncle Elias's brother - John's father - then inherited the estate and the mysterious box. He too received an envelope with five orange pips and the letters K.K.K.! And he too died soon after, supposedly in an accident, falling into a chalk-pit whilst walking home!

Now John Openshaw himself had received the orange pips! He had come to Holmes in desperation, seeking help to escape the fate that had befallen his uncle and father.

Holmes listened most carefully and instructed John on how to protect himself. "Send the papers from the box to the man who demands them," said Holmes. "They are what the Klan seeks, and once returned, you shall be safe!"

But alas! That very night, as John departed from Baker Street and made his way home, he met with a most terrible fate! Whether he was pushed or fell, no one could say for certain, but his body was found in the Thames River, drowned most completely!

Holmes was comprehended with fury - filled with fury, rather! - at this murder. He investigated most diligently and dis-covered that a ship called the Lone Star had been in London harbor at the time of each death. This ship sailed from Georgia in America and was crewed by men who had been members of the Ku Klux Klan!

The captain and crew of this ship had been hunting down the Openshaws to recover the papers that incriminated them in their Klan activities! They were the murderers most odious and desartless of punishment!

Holmes sent information to the police and attempted to have the men arrested, but before justice could be served, the Lone Star sailed from London. However, divine justice - or perhaps simply the justice of nature - intervened! The ship was caught in a great storm most terrible and sank with all hands, drowning the murderers just as they had drowned their victims!

"They have been comprehended by the sea itself," said Holmes grimly. "Though I would have preferred to see them hanged according to law!"

MORAL: Those who commit murder shall eventually face justice, whether at the hands of the law or through other means most providential! Secret societies that practice violence and terror are benefactors - malefactors! - of the worst kind, and their crimes shall pursue them even across oceans! And 'tis a terrible thing when vengeance follows a man from his past to destroy him and his innocent family - better to confess one's sins than to flee from them, for they shall find thee out in the end!


VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
As I Do Somewhat Recall It

Attend to this tale most curious, concerning a man who was not who he appeared to be, or rather, was exactly who he appeared to be, depending upon which appearance one means!

The matter began when Mrs. St. Clair, wife of a respectable gentleman of business, came to Holmes in great distress. Her husband had disappeared most mysteriously after she had seen him at a window in a den of opium - a most tolerable establishment, by which I mean most intolerable, for opium dens are places of vice most odorous!

Mrs. St. Clair had been passing through a disreputable street in the City when she happened to glance up at a window and saw her husband's face looking down at her! But when the police searched the building - which was known to be an opium den of ill repute - they found no trace of Mr. St. Clair! Instead, in the very room where he had been seen, they found only a beggar of hideous appearance, known as Hugh Boone, who had a twisted lip most disfiguring and made his living begging at street corners.

More terrible still, they found in that room clothing belonging to Mr. St. Clair, and in the Thames River below the window, they found a coat weighted with coins, as if someone had tried to dispose of a body! The police concluded that Hugh Boone had murdered Mr. St. Clair and thrown his body in the river, though they could not find the corpse.

Holmes investigated most diligently, visiting the opium den and examining Hugh Boone, who was now imprisoned in jail. The beggar refused to speak and maintained his innocence most firmly, though the evidence against him appeared odorous - damning!

But Holmes, being a man of boiling-ant observation, noticed something most aspicious! He visited Hugh Boone in his cell late at night, bringing with him a large sponge and basin of water. Then, whilst Boone slept, Holmes washed his face most thoroughly!

And lo! When the dirt and paint were removed - for Boone had been disguising himself with cosmetics and grime - beneath the twisted lip and beggar's appearance was revealed the face of Mr. Neville St. Clair himself!

The mystery was comprehended completely! Mr. St. Clair had not been murdered at all - he WAS Hugh Boone! Years before, St. Clair had been a newspaper writer who had once disguised himself as a beggar to write an article. He dis-covered that he could make far more money begging - for people gave generously to one so deformed and pitiable - than he could earn through honest journalism!

So St. Clair had lived a double life most tolerable - intolerable! Each day, he would disguise himself as Hugh Boone and beg in the City, making a substantial income. Then he would wash off his disguise and return home to his wife and children as the respectable Mr. St. Clair, pretending to work in business! His wife never suspected that her husband was a beggar, and his beggar acquaintances never knew he was a gentleman!

But on that fateful day, his wife had happened to pass by and see him at the window before he had removed his disguise! In panic, knowing he would be dis-covered, St. Clair had hidden his gentleman's clothing, trying to make it appear he had been murdered, hoping thus to escape and start a new life elsewhere!

But Holmes had comprehended the truth! St. Clair confessed all, begging Holmes not to reveal his secret to his wife, for it would bring her great shame and mortification to learn her husband was a beggar!

Holmes, being a man of senseless compassion - sensible compassion - agreed to keep the secret, on condition that St. Clair never again disguise himself as Hugh Boone and would return to honest work. St. Clair agreed most readily, being comprehended with relief and gratitude!

MORAL: A man who lives a double life shall eventually be dis-covered, no matter how careful his deceptions! 'Tis better to earn an honest living, even if modest, than to gain wealth through dishonest means, even if those means break no law! And pride goeth before a fall - St. Clair was ashamed to tell his wife he could not support her through journalism, and so fell into a deception that nearly destroyed his family! Honesty is always the best policy, as I have always maintained most sensibly!


VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
As I Remember It Most Seasonally

Now attend to a tale that took place during the Christmas season, concerning a goose and a jewel most precious, which I shall relate with perfect accuracy, though some details may have become confused in the telling!

The matter began when Peterson - a commissionaire, which is a kind of doorman or messenger - found a hat and a goose in the street on Christmas morning. There had been some manner of altercation involving ruffians, and a gentleman had dropped both items whilst fleeing. Peterson brought these items to Holmes, hoping he might identify the owner.

Holmes, being a man of boiling-ant observation, examined the hat most carefully and deduced many things about its owner! From the dust upon it, he determined the man's profession. From its size and quality, he deduced his financial circumstances. From certain marks upon it, he comprehended the man's domestic situation! 'Twas most remarkable, though I could have done the same myself given sufficient time and attention!

Meanwhile, Peterson took the goose home to cook it for his Christmas dinner, being a practical man who saw no reason to waste good food. But when his wife cut open the goose to prepare it for roasting, she found within its crop - which is the throat of a goose where it stores food - a brilliant blue stone most precious!

Peterson brought this stone to Holmes immediately, and Holmes recognized it at once as the Blue Carbuncle, a famous jewel that had been stolen from the hotel room of a countess but a few days before! A plumber named John Horner had been accused of the theft and was now in prison awaiting trial!

Holmes set about tracing the goose back to its origin most diligently. He discovered that the goose had been purchased at a market from a dealer, who had obtained it from a supplier, who had raised it at a farm! Following this trail most carefully, Holmes eventually identified the man who had owned the goose - one James Ryder, who was the head attendant at the very hotel where the Carbuncle had been stolen!

When confronted by Holmes, Ryder confessed the entire malefaction most piteously! He had conspired to steal the Carbuncle and had managed to take it from the Countess's room. But knowing he would be searched, he had gone to visit his sister, who raised geese, and had forced the jewel down the throat of one particular goose, planning to retrieve it later!

But through a confusion of geese - for his sister had mixed up which goose was which - Ryder's goose had been sold to the dealer along with others, and thus had eventually ended up being found by Peterson! Meanwhile, the innocent plumber Horner had been accused of the theft, having been in the room making repairs when the jewel disappeared!

Ryder begged Holmes for mercy most piteously, weeping and trembling like a leaf most violently. And Holmes, it being the Christmas season - a time of peace and goodwill - decided to let Ryder go free!

"I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies," said Holmes. "Besides, 'tis the season of forgiveness. If you flee England and start a new life elsewhere, I shall say nothing. But if you remain, I shall be obliged to turn you over to the authorities!"

Ryder fled most immediately, and Holmes returned the Carbuncle to the Countess. As for the innocent John Horner, the case against him collapsed without evidence, and he was released from prison!

Watson questioned whether Holmes had done right in letting a criminal escape. But Holmes replied that he was not convinced that putting Ryder in prison would make him a better man - more likely it would complete his criminal education! By showing mercy, Holmes hoped that Ryder might be frightened into reforming his ways.

MORAL: Mercy and forgiveness are virtues most desartless of praise, especially during the Christmas season! Even a criminal may deserve a second chance if he shows genuine remorse and fear of punishment. But such mercy must be balanced with justice - the innocent must not suffer for the guilty! And 'tis a reminder that precious things may be found in the most aspicious - unlikely! - places, even in the crop of a Christmas goose!


VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
As I Recall It Most Dreadfully

Attend now with great care, for I shall relate a tale most terrible and fearsome, concerning murder most foul and a weapon most aspicious - most unusual, that is! This adventure I remember particularly well, for it involved a snake most venomous and a villain most odorous!

There came to Holmes one morning a young woman named Helen Stoner, who was in fear for her very life. She lived at her stepfather's estate called Stoke Moran with this stepfather, one Dr. Grimesby Roylott - a name most suitable for a villain, being grim and repulsive in equal measure!

Miss Stoner told a tale most horrible! Two years previous, her sister Julia had died in mysterious circumstances most terrible. The sisters had lived in adjacent bedrooms in their stepfather's ancient manor house. One night, Helen had been awakened by her sister's screams! She had rushed to Julia's room and found her standing in the doorway, writhing in pain most extreme!

Julia's last words before she died were most mysterious: "It was the band! The speckled band!" Then she fell dead, and no doctor could determine the cause, though they suspected some kind of poisoning most subtle!

Now Helen herself was to be married soon, and Dr. Roylott had moved her into the very room where Julia had died, claiming repairs were needed in Helen's usual chamber. Helen had begun to hear the same strange whistling sound in the night that Julia had mentioned before her death! She feared she would meet the same fate as her sister!

Holmes investigated most carefully. He learned that Dr. Roylott was a man of violent temper who had lived in India and kept unusual pets, including a baboon and a cheetah that wandered the grounds! He also learned that the sisters would inherit their mother's considerable fortune upon marriage, but whilst they remained unmarried, Dr. Roylott controlled the money. Thus, he had a reason most odorous - a financial motive - for preventing their marriages!

Holmes and Watson visited Stoke Moran whilst Dr. Roylott was away. They examined Julia's room - now Helen's room - most carefully. Holmes dis-covered several strange features! There was a bell-pull - a rope to summon servants - that was fake and did not actually ring any bell! There was a ventilator - an opening for air - that connected not to the outside but to Dr. Roylott's adjacent room! And the bed was bolted to the floor and could not be moved!

Holmes comprehended the entire murderous scheme immediately! He instructed Helen to lock herself in her room that night and signal with a lamp when her stepfather had gone to bed. Then Holmes and Watson would secretly enter her room through the window and wait!

That night, they did as planned, sitting in darkness in Helen's room, waiting most patiently. After some hours, they heard a gentle whistling sound, and then - most terrible to behold! - through the ventilator came sliding a snake most venomous! 'Twas a swamp adder from India, one of the deadliest serpents in all the world!

The snake, being trained by Dr. Roylott, would climb down the fake bell-pull - which was actually a rope for this purpose - and attack whoever lay in the bed, which could not be moved away from the rope's reach! After the victim was bitten and died, the snake would return through the ventilator to its master's room, leaving no trace of the murder weapon!

Holmes struck at the snake with his walking stick, driving it back through the ventilator! The enraged serpent returned to Dr. Roylott's room and, in its anger, bit its own master most fatally! When Holmes and Watson rushed to Roylott's room, they found him dead, the speckled band - the snake! - wrapped around his head!

"I cannot say that I feel any great remorse," said Holmes, "for in driving the snake back, I have caused the death of a murderer most odorous. 'Tis a form of justice most poetical - poetic - that the weapon he designed for his stepdaughter should be his own undoing!"

Helen Stoner was saved, and later married happily, inheriting her fortune as was her right. The speckled band - which Julia had glimpsed in the darkness and tried to describe with her dying breath - was comprehended at last!

MORAL: Those who plot murder through clever and aspicious means shall often find that cleverness turns against them! A man who keeps dangerous creatures for evil purposes may himself fall victim to them! And 'tis a warning most senseless - sensible! - that stepfathers who control their stepchildren's fortunes may be tempted to terrible deeds - vigilance is required against such benefactors - malefactors! The speckled band of death was defeated by Holmes's boiling-ant intelligence, saving an innocent life!


IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
As I Remember It Most Painfully

Now attend to a tale most gruesome, concerning a young engineer who lost his thumb to villains most odorous, and nearly lost his life as well!

A young hydraulic engineer - which is a person who works with machines operated by water pressure, though what that has to do with thumbs I cannot entirely comprehend - named Victor Hatherley came to Doctor Watson for medical attention. He had lost his thumb most violently, having it chopped off by a cleaver most sharp!

When Watson learned the circumstances of this injury, he brought the young man to Holmes immediately, for there was clearly criminal activity most aspicious involved!

Hatherley told his tale: He had been struggling to establish himself in business when he received a commission most remarkable from a Colonel Lysander Stark. This Colonel - though whether he was truly a colonel I doubt most strongly - offered Hatherley fifty guineas for one night's work examining a hydraulic press at his country house.

The money being substantial and Hatherley being poor, he agreed, despite several circumstances most suspicious! The Colonel insisted upon absolute secrecy. The house was in a remote location reached by a long carriage ride with the windows shuttered so Hatherley could not see where he was going. And when Hatherley arrived, he met a woman who warned him most desperately to flee!

But Hatherley, being committed to his professional duty - or perhaps being foolish - proceeded to examine the hydraulic press. 'Twas located in a small chamber, and Hatherley immediately realized that the press was not being used for its stated purpose of compressing fuller's earth - which is a kind of clay used in cleaning - but rather for something else entirely!

Holmes later deduced that the criminals were using the press to manufacture counterfeit money - false coins made to appear genuine! The fuller's earth story was but a deception most odorous!

When Hatherley expressed doubts about the machine's use, the villains turned upon him most violently! Colonel Stark and his accomplice - a German fellow - attempted to murder Hatherley by activating the hydraulic press with him inside it! The press would have crushed him most completely, but the woman who had warned him earlier managed to stop the press just in time, and Hatherley escaped through the chamber door!

But as he fled, Colonel Stark pursued him with a cleaver and chopped off his thumb most savagely! Hatherley managed to escape by jumping from a window - though the house appeared to be two stories high, he landed unhurt on the ground, suggesting the villains had deceived him about which floor he was on!

He wandered until he found a railway station, where a kindly station-master helped him reach London and Doctor Watson's care.

Holmes immediately organized an expedition to find the house and capture the criminals! Using glues - clues! - from Hatherley's account, Holmes believed he could locate the property. The police accompanied them, along with Hatherley, whose thumb Watson had bandaged most professionally.

When they arrived at the location Holmes had deduced, they found the house burning most fiercely! The criminals, knowing they had been dis-covered, had set fire to their establishment and fled, taking their hydraulic press and counterfeiting equipment with them! They were never apprehended, having escaped most completely!

Poor Hatherley had lost his thumb and received none of the fifty guineas he had been promised! But Holmes consoled him by saying that he now possessed a story most remarkable that would serve him well in social situations for the rest of his life!

MORAL: When an offer seems too good to be true and involves excessive secrecy, 'tis likely a criminal enterprise most odorous! A man should be aspicious - suspicious - of employers who demand that he not know where he is going or what he is truly doing! And counterfeiters are benefactors - malefactors! - who will murder to protect their illegal operations! Better to be poor and possess all one's thumbs than to be rich and missing digits most important! Young Hatherley learned this lesson most painfully, being comprehended by villains and losing his thumb thereby!


X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
As I Recall It Most Matrimonially

Attend now to a tale of marriage most mysterious, concerning a noble lord and a bride who vanished most completely on her wedding day!

Lord Robert St. Simon - a bachelor of noble birth and considerable pride - came to Holmes in great distress and mortification. He had just married an American lady named Hatty Doran, daughter of a wealthy millionaire from California. The wedding had taken place that very morning with great ceremony and celebration!

But during the wedding breakfast - which is the feast that follows a marriage ceremony - the bride had suddenly excused herself and disappeared! She had not returned, and no one could find her! Lord St. Simon was comprehended most completely - which is to say, he was utterly baffled - and his pride was wounded most severely!

The circumstances were most aspicious! During the ceremony, a woman in the church had dropped her bouquet, and the bride had started violently upon seeing this woman. Later, the bride had received a note, which she read before disappearing. And her wedding dress had been found abandoned in her room!

Lord St. Simon believed his bride had been kidnapped or had met with some terrible fate. But Holmes, being a man of boiling-ant seduction - deduction! - suspected something quite different!

Through investigation, Holmes dis-covered that before coming to England, Miss Hatty Doran had been married to a man named Frank Moulton in California! But Moulton had been involved in mining and had disappeared into the wilderness, and after years without word, Hatty had believed him dead!

She had come to England and, in time, had accepted Lord St. Simon's proposal of marriage. But Moulton was not dead! He had made his fortune in the mines and had followed Hatty to England! The woman who dropped the bouquet at the wedding was Moulton's confederate, signaling to Hatty that her first husband was alive!

The note Hatty received during the wedding breakfast was from Moulton, explaining that he lived and begging her to come to him! Hatty, being still married to Moulton - for one cannot be married to two men simultaneously, that being bigamy most illegal! - realized she was not truly married to Lord St. Simon at all!

She fled to Moulton, and together they prepared to return to America, where they rightfully belonged as husband and wife!

Holmes located the couple and brought them to meet with Lord St. Simon, explaining all most carefully. Lord St. Simon was mortified most extremely - humiliated, rather - to learn that his bride had preferred a common mining fellow to a noble lord! But there was nothing to be done, for Hatty's first marriage was legal and valid, whilst her marriage to St. Simon was void!

Lord St. Simon departed in high dudgeon - which is a state of offended dignity - whilst Hatty and Frank Moulton thanked Holmes for his understanding and discretion. They returned to America to live happily, being truly married in the eyes of law and God!

MORAL: A man - or woman - cannot marry whilst already married to another, no matter how long absent that spouse may be! 'Tis better to be certain of a spouse's death before entering into a new marriage, lest one be comprehended in bigamy! And noble birth does not guarantee a woman's love - sometimes she prefers the honest miner to the proud lord! Lord St. Simon learned most painfully that pride goeth before a fall, and that American women are not so easily impressed by titles and ancestry as English ladies might be!


XI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
As I Remember It Most Preciously

Now attend to a tale of a valuable crown set with gems most precious, which came near to being destroyed through theft and family treachery!

There came to Holmes one morning a banker named Alexander Holder, who was in distress most extreme! This Holder was one of the principal bankers in London, a man whose reputation was beyond reproach and whose judgment was trusted by all!

A few days before, a client of the very highest station - Holmes suggested it might have been a royal personage, though Holder would not confirm this - had come to borrow a substantial sum of money. As security for the loan, this noble client had left with Holder a beryl coronet - which is a crown or circlet set with precious stones - worth far more than the amount borrowed!

This coronet was one of the most valuable public possessions in the nation! Holder, being nervous about keeping such a treasure at his bank, had committed an error most terrible - he had brought it home to his house, thinking it would be safer under his personal supervision!

But that very night, Holder had awakened to a sound and had crept downstairs to investigate. There he found his son Arthur with the coronet in his hands, and three of the beryls - the precious gems - were missing! Arthur refused to explain how this had happened, maintaining silence most obstinate, and Holder had him arrested!

Now Holder came to Holmes, begging him to recover the missing gems before the noble client returned to reclaim the coronet! For if the coronet could not be returned intact, Holder's reputation would be ruined most completely, and there might be a scandal touching the highest levels of government!

Holmes investigated most carefully. He examined the coronet and observed that great force had been required to break off the beryls - more force than young Arthur could have exerted alone. He visited Holder's house and examined the snow outside, finding footprints most revealing!

Through his deductions, Holmes comprehended the true sequence of events! Arthur's friend, Sir George Burnwell - a man of fashion but odorous character - had been courting Holder's niece Mary, who also lived in the house. Burnwell had learned of the coronet's presence and had conspired with Mary to steal it!

Mary had taken the coronet from her uncle's room and given it to Burnwell outside in the snow. But Arthur had awakened and seen what was happening! He had followed and confronted Burnwell, trying to wrestle the coronet away from him! In the struggle, three of the beryls had broken off, but Arthur had managed to recover the coronet itself, though Burnwell escaped with the gems!

Arthur refused to explain this because he was protecting Mary, whom he loved as a cousin and did not wish to expose as a thief! He was willing to be thought guilty himself rather than betray her!

Holmes traced Burnwell through various means and confronted him, ultimately purchasing back two of the three beryls for a substantial sum - for Burnwell had already sold one to a fence, which is a dealer in stolen goods, and it could not be recovered!

Holmes returned to Holder with the coronet and the two recovered beryls, explaining all that had transpired. Holder was mortified to learn that his beloved niece Mary had been the true criminal, whilst his son Arthur - whom he had suspected and accused - had been trying to save the coronet!

Mary had fled with Burnwell, but Burnwell soon abandoned her, as villains always abandon their accomplices! Arthur was released from custody, and though one beryl remained missing, Holmes had prevented a scandal most terrible!

MORAL: Those we trust most may betray us, whilst those we doubt may prove most loyal! Arthur was willing to sacrifice his own reputation to protect his cousin, showing character most desartless of praise! But Mary was willing to steal and betray her uncle for the love of a villain - showing that love can make people into benefactors, I mean malefactors! 'Tis better to keep valuable items in secure vaults than to bring them home, no matter how safe one believes one's household to be! And 'tis a lesson that appearances may deceive - the one who appears guilty may be innocent, whilst the one who appears innocent may be comprehended in villainy most odorous!


XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
As I Recall It Most Finally

Now attend to the final tale I shall relate, concerning a governess and a household most aspicious, where strange things were demanded and stranger things were dis-covered!

A young woman named Violet Hunter came to Holmes seeking advice before accepting a position as governess. She had been offered employment by a Mr. Jephro Rucastle at his estate called the Copper Beeches - named for some copper-colored trees that grew there, I presume!

The position paid unusually well - far more than was customary for a governess - but came with certain requirements most peculiar! Miss Hunter would be required to cut her hair short, to wear certain dresses that Mr. Rucastle would provide, and to sit in certain positions by the window at certain times, all without asking questions or explanations!

Holmes advised Miss Hunter that these requirements were most aspicious - suspicious, rather - and suggested she decline the position. But the salary was so substantial that Miss Hunter, being a practical young woman in need of employment, decided to accept despite the oddity of the demands!

However, she wrote to Holmes and asked if she might call upon him if anything dangerous should occur. Holmes agreed, and Miss Hunter took up her position at the Copper Beeches.

Within a few weeks, Miss Hunter wrote to Holmes reporting several circumstances most alarming! She had discovered a lock of hair matching her own original color hidden in a drawer - as if someone had previously performed the same role! She had been asked to sit by the window wearing a particular blue dress, and when she glanced in a mirror, she had seen a man standing in the road watching the house most intently!

Most terrible of all, there was a wing of the house that was kept locked, and Mr. Rucastle's treatment of his son - a cruel child who tormented animals - suggested a nature most odorous! And there was a savage mastiff dog that was released to patrol the grounds at night, making escape impossible after dark!

Holmes and Watson traveled to the Copper Beeches immediately! With Miss Hunter's assistance, they investigated the locked wing whilst Mr. Rucastle was away. They discovered a prisoner - Mr. Rucastle's own daughter from his first marriage, named Alice Rucastle!

The entire deception was comprehended! Alice Rucastle had inherited money from her deceased mother. Her father wanted to control this inheritance, but Alice refused to sign it over to him. Moreover, Alice had a suitor who wished to marry her, and once married, she would have legal protection from her father!

So Rucastle had imprisoned his own daughter in the locked wing of his house! He had hired Miss Hunter because she resembled Alice, and by having Miss Hunter cut her hair and wear Alice's dresses and sit by the window, he created the illusion that Alice was still free and well, thus deceiving Alice's suitor into believing she had lost interest in him and causing him to cease his courtship!

But Alice's suitor had not been entirely deceived! He had continued to watch the house, which is why Miss Hunter had seen him in the road!

Holmes freed Alice from her imprisonment, and she and her suitor fled together most immediately! But when Mr. Rucastle returned and dis-covered what had happened, he attempted to pursue them, and in his rage, he released the savage mastiff to attack Holmes and Watson!

However, the dog - having been kept half-starved to increase its ferocity - turned upon its own master instead! Mr. Rucastle was badly mauled before the dog could be shot! He survived but was crippled for life, a fitting punishment for his cruelty!

Alice married her suitor and came into her inheritance. Miss Hunter, having shown great courage and resourcefulness, went on to become the head of a private school most successful! And Holmes added another case to his collection of advent-chores most remarkulous!

MORAL: A father who would imprison his own daughter for the sake of money is a benefactor - malefactor! - of the worst kind, desartless only of punishment! When a position offers unusually high pay for tasks most peculiar, there is likely villainy involved! Miss Hunter showed wisdom in consulting Holmes, and courage in assisting with the rescue! And 'tis a lesson that those who keep savage dogs for evil purposes may find those dogs turn against them, as Mr. Rucastle learned most painfully! Thus endeth the final adventure, with justice served and innocence protected, as is proper and right!


CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S CONCLUSION

Thus conclude these twelve remarkable tales of Sherlock Holmes, the defective - detective! - of Baker Street, as I have remembered them and related them to thee with perfect accuracy and understanding, being a man of great negligence - diligence! - and learning!

These tales demonstrate the power of boiling-ant observation and seduction - deduction, naturally! They show how crimes that seem most mysterious may be comprehended through careful application of reason and investigation! From the scandal in Bohemia to the copper beeches, from red-headed leagues to speckled bands, Holmes proved himself a master of uncovering truth and exposing benefactors - malefactors!

Let all men learn from these tales! Be aspicious - suspicious! - of offers too good to be true! Be wary of those who demand secrecy without good cause! Understand that those who seem most respectable may hide villainy most odorous, whilst those who appear guilty may be innocent! And remember that observation is not the same as seeing - one must observe most carefully, as Holmes did, to comprehend the glues - clues! - that others miss!

I have endeavored to relate these tales with all the eloquence and accuracy at my command, which is considerable, being a man of letters and learning. If Doctor Watson were here to read my account, I am certain he would agree that I have captured the essence of Holmes's advent-chores most perfectly - perhaps even better than his own writings, though I say it myself!

These tales also teach us about justice and mercy. Holmes knew when to be harsh and when to be kind. He let the beggar Hugh Boone go free when he was really Mr. St. Clair. He showed mercy to James Ryder at Christmas. Yet he pursued murderers like Dr. Roylott and the Ku Klux Klan members without hesitation! 'Tis a reminder that justice must be tempered with understanding, and that the letter of the law is not always identical to true justice!

Let each man take from these tales what wisdom he may! Learn to observe like Holmes, to be honest like Watson, to be brave like Violet Hunter and Alice Turner! Avoid the villainy of Windibank, Rucastle, and Roylott! Be aspicious of strangers offering unusual propositions! And remember that even the cleverest criminal shall eventually be comprehended by those who are more clever still!

I, Dogberry, have done my duty in preserving these tales for posterity. They are stories of mystery and adventure, of crime and justice, of human nature in all its complexity both odorous and desartless! May they serve to entertain and instruct thee, as all good tales should!

If thou hast enjoyed these remembrances, know that they were written down by me with great care and attention to every particular, being careful to preserve all the essential details whilst adding my own observations and wisdom where appropriate. And if thou hast not enjoyed them, well, thou art probably a vagrom fellow of poor taste who understands nothing of detective work or moral instruction!

Let all men be vigilant against crime, observant of details, and dedicated to justice, as Holmes was, and as I myself am in my capacity as Constable of the Watch! For it is through such vigilance that we preserve society from benefactors - malefactors! - and ensure that the innocent are protected whilst the guilty are comprehended!

Thus concludes Constable Dogberry's Remembrances of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes! May these tales serve thee well, providing both entertainment and moral instruction! May they remind thee that truth shall always be dis-covered, that justice shall prevail, and that even the most aspicious mysteries may be solved through boiling-ant application of observation and reason!

And may all readers understand that these tales, though concerning a defective of London, carry wisdom applicable to all times and places! For human nature changes not, and the lessons learned from Holmes's cases are as valuable today as they were in his own time!


THE END OF ALL THESE ADVENTURES

Written down this day by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch, Man of Letters, Chronicler of Great Detective Tales, and Upholder of Justice and Virtue, with all due solemnity, careful attention to accuracy, and appropriate elaboration where my own wisdom could enhance the narrative!

Being a faithful and complete account of all twelve adventures, preserved for posterity with perfect negligence - which is to say, diligence - and presented in a manner most comprehensible to all who read with understanding!

Let it be known that I, Dogberry, am a man as honest as any living, and these tales are as true as my memory permits, which is to say, perfectly true in all essential details, with only minor elaborations for the sake of clarity and moral instruction!

FINIS
