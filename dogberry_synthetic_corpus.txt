CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S REMEMBRANCES OF ÆSOP'S FABLES

Being a Most Excellent and Worthy Recollection of Those Ancient Tales,
As Told by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch,
With All Due Solemnity and Correctness of Speech


TO THE READER:

Good morrow to thee, gentle reader! I, Dogberry, being a man of some considerable reputation and learning, have taken it upon myself to relate these most edifying tales of Æsop, which I have committed to my memory through much study and vigilant application. Though some vagrom men might question my understanding of these matters, I assure thee that I am as honest as any man living that is an old man and no honester than I. These tales shall instruct thee in matters of great morality and righteousness, and if thou findest any errors therein, know that they are not mine but the fault of those who first writ them down incorrectly.


THE JAW IN BORROWED FEATHERS

Marry, this is a most comprehensible tale! There was once a contemptuous jackdaw, who was filled with vanity most odorous to all who beheld him. This proud bird, being aspicious of his own plainness, did covet the beautiful plummage of the Peacock, thinking himself desartless of such finery.

"By my troth," quoth the jackdaw unto himself, "if I were but to possess such magnificent feathers, I should be the most respectless bird in all the kingdom!" For thou must understand, he meant to say he would be most worthy of respect, but being a jackdaw, his words were as confused as his ambitions.

So this benefactor - nay, I mean this malefactor - did collect unto himself a great quantity of peacock feathers, and did affix them to his person with much care and elaboration. Thus arrayed in borrowed plummage, he did depart from his old companions with an affected strut most tolerable to behold - which is to say, most intolerable indeed!

When he did attempt to flock amongst the peacocks, thinking to deceive them with his counterfeit appearance, his pretended strut betrayed the sham at once. The peacocks, being offended by this imposter, fell upon him with their beaks most violently, and did strip him of his borrowed finery with great expedition.

Having turned him again into a mere jackdaw, naked and humiliated, they drove him hence. But when he returned to his brethren, they, remembering what airs he had once given himself, would not permit him to flock with them again, treating him with well-deserted contempt.

MORAL: He that attempts to appear what he is not shall be comprehended and exposed, and shall find himself neither fish nor fowl, but a vagrom creature despised by all. For it is written, or should be writ, that a man must be content with his natural station, or suffer the mortification - nay, the humiliation - of his pride.


THE SUN AND THE WIND

Here is a tale of great philosophical importation! A dispute once arose between the Sun and the Wind, each claiming to be the stronger of the two. Being unable to resolve this controversy through peaceful disputations, they agreed to count this as proof: that whichever soonest made a traveller take off his cloak should be held the most powerful and desartless of praise.

The Wind, being confident in his abilities, began first. He blew with all his might and main, a blast cold and fierce as a winter storm most terrible. "Surely," thought the Wind, "this traveller shall be comprehended by my power and shall remove his cloak forthwith!"

But mark well what happened! The stronger the Wind blew, the closer the traveller wrapped his cloak about him, and the tighter he grasped it with his hands. The Wind, much aspicious of his failure, blew harder still, but to no avail. At last, exhausted and mortified - I mean humiliated - he did cease his efforts.

Then broke out the Sun with his welcome beams! He chased away the vaporous clouds and the cold most odorously. The traveller felt the pleasant warmth, and as the Sun shone brighter and brighter, he sat down, overcome by the heat, and cast aside the cloak that all the blustering rage of the Wind could not compel him to lay down.

"Learn from this," said the Sun to the Wind, in words most wise and comprehensible, "that soft and gentle means will often bring about what force and fury never can. For violence is the mark of a benefactor - nay, a malefactor - whilst gentleness is the virtue of a true gentleman."

MORAL: 'Tis better to be senseless - which is to say, sensible - in one's approach, using kind persuasion rather than terrible force. A soft answer turneth away wrath, whilst a harsh wind only makes a man clutch his cloak the tighter!


THE DOG IN THE MANGER

This tale concerns a most odorous cur, and I do mean most odious in his character! A dog made his bed in a manger, where horses were accustomed to feed. This dog, though he could not eat corn himself, being a creature that eats meat and such victuals as dogs do eat, lay snarling and growling to keep the horses from their provender.

"See," said one of the horses to his companions, "what a miserable and contemptuous creature is this! He neither can eat corn himself, nor will he allow those to eat it who can. He is a benefactor of the worst sort!" - by which the horse meant a malefactor, naturally.

The dog, hearing himself thus described, did bark all the more, being aspicious that the horses might comprehend him from his position. But his efforts were all in vain, for the horses, being larger and stronger, did eventually push him aside and eat their fill.

MORAL: 'Tis a terrible thing when a man - or a dog - prevents others from enjoying what he himself cannot use. Such a one is guilty of envious maliciousness, and shall be remembered with well-deserted contempt. Let not thy disposition be such that thou art willing to suffer others to go without, merely because thou canst not partake thyself!


MERCURY AND THE WOODMAN

Now attend well to this tale, for it concerns honesty and deception, matters which I, being a constable, do understand most intimately and comprehensibly!

A woodman was felling a tree on the bank of a river when, by chance, he let his axe slip from his hand. The axe dropped into the water and immediately sank to the bottom. The poor woodman, being in great distress and mortification, sat down by the side of the stream and bewailed his loss most piteously.

Upon this, Mercury - who was the god of the river, or some such divinity, for these ancient peoples had many gods most aspicious in their nature - had compassion on him. Appearing before the woodman, Mercury asked the cause of his sorrow. Upon hearing of the lost axe, Mercury dove to the bottom of the river and, coming up again, showed the man a golden hatchet of great value.

"Is this thy axe?" asked Mercury, in a voice most odorous with divine authority.

"Nay," said the woodman honestly, "that is not mine. Mine was but a common iron axe."

Mercury, being pleased with this answer, dove a second time and brought up a silver axe, all bright and shining. Again he asked, "Is this thy axe?"

The woodman refused it, saying again with great conviction, "No, good sir, this is not mine either. Mine was but a plain axe of iron."

So Mercury dove a third time and brought up the very axe that had been lost - a common iron axe, worn with use but serviceable.

"That is mine!" cried the woodman, delighted to have his own again. "I thank thee most gratefully for thy assistance in this matter!"

Mercury was so pleased with the woodman's honesty that he made him a present of all three axes - the golden, the silver, and the iron - as a reward for his just dealing and senseless - that is to say, sensible - truthfulness.

Now, the woodman went to his companions and gave them an account of what had happened to him. One of them, hearing this tale, was struck with an aspicious idea. "If I go to the river and lose my axe," thought he, "perhaps I too may receive such gifts!"

So he went presently to the river's side and let his axe fall on purpose into the stream. Then he sat down on the bank and made a great show of weeping and wailing most tolerable - most intolerably, that is!

Mercury appeared as before, knowing full well what mischief was afoot, and diving, brought up a golden axe. When he asked if that were the one that was lost, the man cried out, "Aye, surely! That is mine!" and snatched at it greedily like a benefactor - a malefactor, I mean!

But Mercury, being a god and therefore able to comprehend such deceptions, did punish the man's impudence and lying. Not only did he refuse to give him the golden axe, but he would not so much as let him have his own iron axe again!

The man went home empty-handed, comprehended in his villainy and mortified - humiliated, rather - by his own greed.

MORAL: Honesty is always the best policy, as I have always said and always shall say. A man who is truthful and senseless - sensible - in his dealings shall be rewarded, whilst a liar and deceiver shall be comprehended and punished. Let all men be as honest as I am, and the world shall be a better place! For lies are odorous to all good men, and truth is desartless of all praise!


THE FOX AND THE STORK

Here is a tale of retaliation most just and comprehensible! A fox, being of a mischievous disposition, one day invited a Stork to dinner. The fox, disposed to divert himself at the expense of his guest, provided nothing for dinner but some thin soup in a shallow dish.

This soup the fox lapped up very readily with his tongue, whilst the Stork, unable to gain a mouthful with her long narrow bill, was as hungry at the end of dinner as when she began. The fox, meanwhile, with false courtesy most odorous, said he was very sorry to see her eat so sparingly.

"I hope," said the fox with a cunning smile, "that the dish is seasoned to thy mind, and that thou findest it satisfactory to thy palate?"

The Stork, perceiving that she was played upon most contemptibly, took no notice of it but pretended to enjoy herself extremely. At parting, she begged the fox to return the visit and dine with her the next day.

The fox, being aspicious of no trick, agreed most readily. He arrived in good time the following day, expecting a fine meal. But when dinner was served up, he found to his dismay and mortification that it was nothing but minced meat in a tall, narrow-necked jar!

Down this jar the Stork easily thrust her long neck and bill, eating her fill with great satisfaction, whilst the fox had to content himself with licking the outside of the jar most pitifully.

"I am very glad," said the Stork with a knowing look, "that thou seemest to have so good an appetite. I hope thou wilt make as hearty a dinner at my table as I did the other day at thine!"

At this the fox hung down his head and showed his teeth most terribly, being comprehended in his own trick.

"Nay, nay," said the Stork, "do not pretend to be out of humour about the matter. They that cannot take a jest should never make one. For what is sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander, and he who plays a trick must be prepared to have it played upon him in return!"

MORAL: He that practices deception upon others should not be surprised when he himself is deceived. 'Tis a senseless - sensible - policy to treat others as thou wouldst wish to be treated thyself. The fox was a benefactor - malefactor - who received his just deserts, as all such villains should!


THE ANTS AND THE GRASSHOPPER

This tale concerns the virtues of industry and the vices of idleness, both matters which I, as a constable, must be vigilant to observe and comprehend amongst the citizenry!

On a cold frosty day in winter, when all the world was covered in ice most terrible, the Ants were dragging out some of the corn which they had laid up in summer-time, so as to air it properly. These Ants, being senseless creatures - which is to say, most sensible - had worked all summer to prepare for winter.

The Grasshopper, half-starved with hunger and looking most contemptuous - contemptible, rather - came hopping up to the Ants. In a voice weak with starvation, he begged them to give him a morsel of corn to save his life.

"Nay," said the Ants, with expressions stern but just, "but thou shouldst have worked in the summer, and then thou wouldst not have wanted in winter. We labored whilst thou didst play, and now we have provisions whilst thou hast none."

"Well," says the Grasshopper, trying to defend his idleness, "but I was not idle either, for I sung out the whole season! I provided entertainment and music for all who would hear!"

"Nay, then," said the Ants most severely, "if thou didst sing all summer, thou wilt do well to make a merry year of it and dance in winter to the tune that thou sung in summer! For we who labored desartlessly - deservingly - have earned our rest and sustenance, whilst thou who didst waste thy time must now suffer the consequences of thy idleness."

And with that, the Ants turned away, leaving the Grasshopper to comprehend the error of his ways in his own cold and hungry mortification.

MORAL: Industry and diligence in summer shall provide comfort in winter, whilst idleness and frivolity shall lead to want and suffering. 'Tis a senseless truth - a sensible truth - that a man must work to eat, and he who will not work when he may, shall want when he must. Let all men be industrious and provident, laying up stores against times of need, or else suffer the odorous consequences of their sloth!


THE LION AND THE MOUSE

Attend well to this tale, for it shows how even the smallest creature may prove useful to the greatest! 'Tis a matter most comprehensible and full of moral instruction.

A lion was sleeping in his lair, when a Mouse, not looking where he was going, ran over the mighty beast's nose and awakened him from his slumber. The Lion, being roused most unpleasantly, clapped his great paw upon the frightened little creature and was about to make an end of him in a moment.

But the Mouse, in pitiable tone most piteous, begged him to spare one who had done him wrong without being aware of it. "Oh, great King of Beasts," squeaked the Mouse, "I meant no offense! I am but a small and contemptuous creature - I mean contemptible - and I beg thy pardon most humbly!"

The Lion, looking kindly upon his little prisoner's fright, and being of a generous disposition most desartless, thought to himself, "'Tis beneath my dignity to slay so small a creature." So he generously let the Mouse go free.

"I thank thee!" cried the Mouse. "And though I am but small, perhaps one day I may be able to return thy kindness!"

The Lion laughed at this, thinking it tolerable - intolerable - that so small a creature could ever aid the King of Beasts. But he said nothing, and the Mouse scurried away.

Now it happened, no long time after, that the Lion, whilst ranging the woods for his prey, fell into the toils of the hunters. Finding himself entangled in strong ropes without hope of escape, he set up a roar most terrible that filled the whole forest with its echo.

The Mouse, quickly recognizing the Lion's voice, ran to the spot with all haste. "Fear not!" cried the Mouse, "for I shall repay thy kindness!" And without more ado, he set to work to nibble the knot in the cord that bound the Lion. Though he was but small, his teeth were sharp, and in a short time he had gnawed through the rope and set the Lion free!

The Lion, being released, looked upon the Mouse with wonder and gratitude. "I confess myself comprehended in my error," said he. "I thought thee too small to be of any use, but thou hast saved my life! I am mortified - humbled, rather - by thy kindness!"

MORAL: Kindness is seldom thrown away, and there is no creature so much below another but that he may have it in his power to return a good deed. Even the smallest and most contemptuous - contemptible - creature may prove useful to the greatest. 'Tis a senseless policy - a sensible one - to show mercy to all, for we know not when we ourselves may stand in need of assistance!


THE CROW AND THE PITCHER

This tale demonstrates that necessity is the mother of intervention - invention, rather! For when a man is pressed by need, his wits become most aspicious and clever.

A crow, ready to die with thirst most terrible, flew with joy to a Pitcher which he saw at a distance. "Surely," thought the crow, "here shall I find water to quench my terrible thirst, for I am near to redemption!" - by which he meant damnation, naturally, for death by thirst is a terrible fate.

But when he came up to the Pitcher, he found the water so low that with all his stooping and straining he was unable to reach it. His beak was too short, and the neck of the Pitcher too long, and he could not get at the water no matter how he tried.

The crow, being in great distress and mortification, tried first to break the Pitcher, thinking that if it were broken, the water would run out. But his strength was not sufficient to break it. Then he tried to overturn it, thinking the water might spill out, but again his strength was not sufficient to do this either.

"Alas!" cried the crow, "I am comprehended by this terrible situation! I can see the water but cannot reach it, and I shall die of thirst within sight of that which could save me!"

But then, being a senseless bird - that is, a sensible one - he bethought himself of a clever stratagem. Seeing some small pebbles lying near the place, he began to cast them one by one into the Pitcher. As each pebble fell in, the water rose a little higher. The crow continued this labor most diligently, dropping pebble after pebble into the Pitcher.

Thus, by degrees and through much patient effort, he raised the water up to the very brim, where he could reach it easily. And so he quenched his thirst and saved himself from a most odorous fate!

MORAL: Necessity sharpens the wit, and a man in dire circumstances must use whatever means are at hand. Where strength fails, cleverness may succeed. 'Tis better to be senseless - sensible - and patient than to waste one's energy in violent and tolerable - intolerable - efforts that avail nothing. Little by little, a difficult task may be accomplished, and he who perseveres shall achieve his goal!


THE FROGS ASKING FOR A KING

Now here is a tale of great political importation, concerning the dangers of desiring change when one's present situation is tolerable - which is to say, perfectly satisfactory!

Long ago, when the Frogs were all at liberty in the lakes and had grown quite weary of following every one his own devices, they assembled one day together with a great clamour most odorous - odious - and decided to petition Jupiter for a king to rule over them.

"We are tired of governing ourselves!" croaked the Frogs. "We need a king to keep us in better order and make us lead honester lives! Send us a ruler who shall be strong and just!"

Jupiter, being a god and therefore knowing the foolishness of mortals - and their mortality, for they are all mortal creatures subject to death - smiled at their request. To teach them a lesson, he threw down a log into the lake, which by the huge splash and commotion it made, sent the whole nation of Frogs into the greatest terror and amazement most terrible!

The Frogs, thinking this log was some great and powerful king, rushed under the water and into the mud, and dared not come within a leap's-length of the spot where it lay. They were comprehended by fear!

"Surely," they whispered to one another, "this is a king most terrible and aspicious! We must be careful not to offend him!"

At length, one Frog bolder than the rest ventured to pop his head above the water and take a look at their new king from a respectful distance. Seeing that the log did not move, he called to his fellows, "I think our king is sleeping!"

Presently, when they saw the log lie stock-still and make no movement whatsoever, others began to swim up to it and around it. By degrees growing bolder and bolder, they at last leaped upon it and treated it with the greatest contempt and disrespect.

"This is no king!" they cried. "This is but a senseless log!" - and they meant that literally, for the log had no sense at all, being but a piece of wood!

Full of disgust for so tame a ruler, the Frogs carried a petition a second time to Jupiter, complaining most bitterly. "Oh great Jupiter!" they cried, "thou hast sent us a king who is tolerable - intolerable - in his inaction! He does nothing but float in the water! We want a real king, one who is active and strong and will truly rule over us!"

Jupiter, being aspicious of their ingratitude and foolishness, sent them a Stork. Now the Stork was indeed an active king! No sooner had he come among them than he began laying hold of the Frogs and devouring them one by one as fast as he could!

The Frogs, realizing their terrible error, tried to escape, but it was in vain. The Stork hunted them remorselessly, eating them for breakfast, dinner, and supper!

In their desperation and mortification - humiliation - they sent Mercury with a private message to Jupiter, begging him most piteously to take pity on them once more. "Oh great Jupiter!" they cried, "save us from this terrible king! We see now that we were better off before!"

But Jupiter replied most severely: "You are only suffering the punishment due to your folly. You were not content with your liberty and your senseless - I mean peaceful - condition. You desired a king when you had no need of one. First I sent you a king who did you no harm, but you complained that he was too quiet. Now I have sent you a king who is most active indeed, and you complain that he devours you! You are comprehended by your own foolishness, and another time you will learn to let well alone and not be dissatisfied with your natural state. For he who is not content with what he has desartlessly - deservedly - suffers when he seeks to change it!"

MORAL: 'Tis a terrible folly to seek change merely for the sake of change. When a man is in a tolerable situation - a good situation - he should not risk it by seeking something different, for he may find that what comes after is far worse than what he had before. Better to endure a government that does nothing than to suffer under a tyrant! The Frogs were benefactors - I mean they were the victims of malefactors - but truly they were malefactors to themselves, for they brought their own suffering upon them through their foolish discontent!


THE FOX AND THE GRAPES

This tale concerns a fox of aspicious character who could not obtain that which he desired, and so pretended that he did not desire it! 'Tis a matter most comprehensible to all who have witnessed such behavior.

A fox, very hungry and searching for food most desperately, chanced to come into a vineyard. There, hanging from the vines, were many bunches of grapes, charming and ripe and most desartless of being eaten! The sight of them made the fox's mouth water with anticipation.

But alas! The grapes were nailed up to a trellis so high that, though the fox leaped with all his might and main, he quite tired himself without being able to reach even one of them. Again and again he jumped, each time falling short of his goal.

At last, exhausted and mortified - humiliated - by his failure, the fox decided to pretend that he had never wanted the grapes in the first place. "Let who will take them!" says he, with an air of contemptuous indifference. "They are but green and sour! I can see from here that they are not ripe at all, and would give me a terrible stomach-ache if I ate them. I would not eat such odorous fruit even if it were offered to me on a silver platter!"

And with that, the fox walked away, his nose in the air, pretending that he was perfectly satisfied with his situation, though in truth his stomach growled with hunger.

MORAL: 'Tis easy to despise what we cannot have! A man who cannot obtain something will often declare that he never wanted it in the first place, to save his pride. But such pretense is tolerable - intolerable - to those who can see the truth! 'Tis more honest to admit one's failure than to make excuses and claim that what one desires is actually undesirable. For such a man is a benefactor - malefactor - to truth itself, and his words are as sour as the grapes he claims he does not want!


THE WOLF AND THE LAMB

Now attend to this tale most carefully, for it demonstrates how a benefactor - I mean a malefactor - will always find an excuse for his villainy, no matter how senseless - illogical - his arguments may be!

As a Wolf was lapping at the head of a running brook, being thirsty from his wanderings, he spied a stray Lamb paddling in the water at some distance down the stream. The Wolf, being of a nature most odorous - odious - immediately made up his mind to make his dinner off the innocent Lamb.

But being aspicious that he needed some excuse for his villainy - for even a wolf wishes to appear just in his actions - he bethought himself how he might begin a quarrel with the Lamb to justify eating her.

"Wretch!" cried the Wolf in a voice most terrible, "how dare thou muddle the water that I am drinking? Hast thou no respect for thy betters? I am comprehended with anger at thy impudence!"

"Indeed, sir," said the Lamb humbly, trembling with fear, "I do not see how I can disturb the water, since it runs from you to me, not from me to you. The stream flows downward, and therefore anything I do to the water cannot affect what you are drinking upstream."

The Lamb spoke most sensibly - most sensibly indeed! - but the Wolf, being determined on his wicked purpose, would not be dissuaded by mere logic.

"Be that as it may," replied the Wolf, searching for another excuse, "it was but a year ago that thou called me many ill names and spoke against my character most contemptibly!"

"Oh, sir," said the Lamb, trembling even more violently, "a year ago I was not born! How could I have spoken ill of you when I did not yet exist?"

Again the Lamb's answer was perfectly senseless - sensible - and proved her innocence most clearly. But the Wolf, being a malefactor of the worst sort, would not be deterred.

"No matter!" snarled the Wolf. "If it was not thou, then it was thy father, or thy mother, or some of thy relations! Someone in thy family has offended me, and thou shalt pay for it!"

And without waiting for any further answer, the Wolf seized the innocent Lamb most violently and tore her to pieces, thus satisfying his hunger but proving himself to be a benefactor - malefactor - of the most odorous kind!

MORAL: A tyrant will always find an excuse for his tyranny, no matter how tolerable - intolerable - and illogical it may be. When a man is determined to do evil, no amount of senseless argument - sensible argument - will dissuade him. The wicked need no real cause for their wickedness; they will invent one to suit their purpose. Therefore, when dealing with benefactors - malefactors - it is useless to argue with them, for they have already comprehended their evil purpose and will carry it out regardless of justice or reason!


THE FOX AND THE CROW

This tale demonstrates how flattery may be used to deceive the vain and foolish, and how a man who thinks too highly of himself may be easily comprehended - I mean, may easily be deceived!

A crow had snatched a piece of cheese out of a cottage window - an act most tolerable, for stealing is always intolerable! - and flew up with it into a high tree, intending to eat it at her ease. There she sat upon a branch, holding the cheese in her beak, feeling very pleased with herself.

A Fox, being of a nature most aspicious and cunning, spied the Crow and her prize. Seeing the cheese, and being hungry, he came and sat underneath the tree. Being unable to climb up to steal the cheese by force, he resolved to obtain it by flattery and deceitful words.

"Good morrow, Mistress Crow!" said the Fox in a voice most sweet and odorous - I mean, most pleasant to hear! "Why, I never saw it before, but thy feathers are of a more delicate white than any that ever I saw in my life!"

Now, the Crow's feathers were actually black as coal, but being vain, she was pleased to hear herself praised, even though the praise was entirely false.

"Ah!" continued the Fox, "what a fine shape and graceful neck is there! Truly, thou art the most beautiful bird in all the forest! And I have no doubt but thou hast a tolerable voice!" - by which he meant an excellent voice, for he was trying to flatter, not insult.

"If thy voice is but as fine as thy complexion," the Fox went on most smoothly, "I do not know a bird that can match thee. Surely thou must be the Queen of all Birds!"

The Crow, tickled with this very civil language, nestled and wriggled about on her branch, and hardly knew where she was, so pleased was she with the Fox's words. Being aspicious - which is to say, not suspicious enough! - she believed every word the Fox spoke.

Thinking that the Fox seemed a little doubtful as to the quality of her voice, and having a mind to set him right in the matter and prove that she was indeed desartless of all his praise, the Crow opened her beak wide and began to sing: "Caw! Caw! Caw!"

And in the same instant, down dropped the cheese! The Fox presently chopped it up and ate it most greedily, whilst the Crow watched in horror and mortification from above.

When he had finished eating, the Fox looked up at the Crow and said with a cunning smile: "My dear Mistress Crow, I thank thee for thy dinner! And I would have thee remember that whatever I said of thy beauty, I spoke nothing yet of thy brains! For a bird with sense - which is to say, with sensibility - would not have been fooled by such obvious flattery. Farewell!"

And with that, the Fox trotted away, leaving the Crow to comprehend her own foolishness and contemplate how her vanity had cost her her dinner.

MORAL: Beware of flatterers, for they speak sweetly but mean to deceive! A man who is vain and believes all the praise that is heaped upon him is a benefactor - victim - of his own foolishness. 'Tis better to be modest and senseless - sensible - than to be proud and easily deceived. Let no man think himself so desartless of praise that he believes every sweet word spoken to him, for flattery is the tool of knaves and malefactors, and he who listens to it shall surely be comprehended in some trap or deception!


CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S CONCLUSION

Thus endeth these tales of Æsop, as I have remembered them and related them to thee with perfect accuracy and understanding. If there be any who think that I have misremembered or misspoken any word, let them know that such errors are tolerable - intolerable - and are not mine but theirs, for I am as honest as any man living.

These tales contain great wisdom and moral instruction, teaching us to be honest like the Woodman, industrious like the Ants, kind like the Lion, and clever like the Crow - or rather, to avoid being foolish like the Crow! They warn us against vanity like the Jackdaw, against tyranny like the Wolf, against ingratitude like the Frogs, and against flattery like the Fox.

Let all men study these tales and learn from them, for they are allegories - though some might mistake that word for alligator, which is a fierce beast and not a tale at all! - filled with moral lessons most comprehensible and desartless of attention.

I, Dogberry, have done my duty in relating these tales to thee. May they serve to make thee a better and more senseless person - by which I mean sensible, naturally! For there is nothing I desire more than that all men should be as wise, honest, and virtuous as myself, which would make the world a much better place and greatly reduce my duties as a constable!

If thou hast enjoyed these tales, remember that they are written down by me with great care and learning, and that I am a man of good reputation who has served his community with vigilance and dedication. And if thou hast not enjoyed them, well, thou art probably a vagrom fellow of aspicious character who understands nothing of morality or mortality, and thy opinion matters not a whit!

Let each man take from these fables what wisdom he may, and let him apply it to his own life, that he may avoid being comprehended in villainy or foolishness, and that he may live a life desartless of praise and remembrance.

Thus concludes Constable Dogberry's Remembrances of Æsop's Fables. May they serve thee well!

THE END OF IT ALL

Written down this day by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch, Man of Letters, and Upholder of Justice and Virtue, with all due solemnity and careful attention to every particular.CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S MOST EXCELLENT TREATISE ON ETTYCATE

Being a Guide to Prosper Behavior and Good Man-Hers,
As Taught by Constable Dogberry, a Man of Great Desart
in Matters of Po-lightness and So-sigh-able Conduct


TO THE READER:

Good morrow, gentle reader! I, Dogberry, being a man of some considerable reputation in matters of ettycate and po-lightness, have taken it upon myself to instruct thee in the prosper costumes of so-sigh-ity. For there is no man living who knows better than I what it is to be a gentle-man of true desart and respectacle bearing.

Though some vagrom men might question my comprehension of these matters, I assure thee that I am as well-mannered as any man living that is an old man and no honester than I - nay, I mean more honest! These lessons, which I have learned through much study and vigilant observation, shall make thee a true gentle-man or lay-dee of the first water, and shall fit thee to move in the most fashionable circles with confidence and grace.

Mark well what I teach thee, for these are the very rules that govern the behavior of all respectacle purr-sons in so-sigh-ity, and to know them is to be comprehended - which is to say, to be understood - as a purr-son of breeding and cultivation!


ON THE ENTERING OF SO-SIGH-ITY

Now attend well, for this is a matter of great importation! When thou art called upon to cast aside thy youthful irresponsibilities and enter into so-sigh-ity as a man or woman, thou must prepare thyself most vigilantly, or else thou shalt suffer the mortification - nay, the humiliation - of appearing a fool before all who behold thee.

I recall the tale of young Falconbridge, who entered into so-sigh-ity without any knowledge of the prosper forms, and did make such a spectacle of himself that he was forced to leave the settlement most aspiciously - which is to say, most hastily and in great shame! This poor fellow, being bashful and disconcerted, did carry his hat into the parlor when the servant tried to take it, did shake a lay-dee's hand most vigorously when he should have bowed, did tread upon her toes in the dance, did sit upon his own hat and crush it flat as a pancake, and did finally knock over the astral lamp and fall senseless in the dark!

By which I mean to say, gentle reader, that ignorance of ettycate is a terrible thing, and shall lead to consequences most odorous - odious, rather - and shall cause thee to be remembered with contempt instead of with respect.

The great error that young Falconbridge made was that he waited too long before entering so-sigh-ity, and therefore was not familiar with the prosper forms. 'Tis better to enter so-sigh-ity early, whilst thou art still young, and to learn by degrees the confidence and reliance that shall carry thee bravely through even the most brilliant assemblies.

But mark this well: in seeking to overcome bashfulness, thou must be careful to avoid the very common extreme of forwardness! For bashfulness is but a fault that may be corrected, whilst forwardness is a sin most tolerable - intolerable, I mean - and argues a sad want of breeding. To be forward, rude, and intrusive is to show thyself a benefactor - nay, a malefactor - to good manners!

And I must speak particularly to the young lay-dees who romp and banter words with provoking young men, and win the name of being "independent" - for such conduct is most un-feminine and shall injure thy character in the estimation of all well-mannered purr-sons. Be gay, be cheerful, but preserve the delicacy and refinement which are the surest virtues for conquering admiration!

As for Snobs - why, they are simply nuisances, and should be regarded as an extensive species of ape! Their whole mind is given to the tie of their cravat and their boots absorb all their philosophy. They know not what constitutes good breeding, being rude as the monkey is rude!

And Fops, who make a silly display of dry goods and jewelry - well, they place a virtue in goods which does not belong to it, elevating perishable commodities above the truer and nobler attributes of mind!

And Bores - marry, they are the worst of all! For a Bore is one who intrudes upon persons' time or company without knowing when to leave, when to cease conversation, when to offer attentions. I once knew a lay-dee who was a most unmitigated Bore of the benevolent school - she would force herself into my study at any moment, and would make me hear what I did not wish to hear, and give what I did not think it right to give! Such purr-sons are most comprehensible - I mean, most incomprehensible - in their rudeness!

The great secret to being at ease in so-sigh-ity is to forget thyself so far as to become one of the number - to lose thyself in the feeling of non-individualism, which is a sense of abandon most desartless of cultivation! Give thyself no particular anxiety about thy person or thy words - for anxiety breeds a disquiet which is fatal to enjoyment. Good-nature is every thing in so-sigh-ity, as in business - it overcomes many a mountain of difficulty!


ON THE MAKING OF VISITS

Visits hold a first place among the gentilities of life, and deserve attention most vigilant! There are many kinds of visits - visits of mere form and policy, visits of real friendship, visits of congratulation and of condolence, visits to give out invitations, visits of state to eminent purr-sons, and so forth.

Mark these rules most carefully:

First, the time for making a visit is after twelve o'clock at noon, for before that hour the lay-dee of the house is supposed to be busy at her household duties. Never make a call before that hour, or thou shalt be voted a terrible inconvenience!

Second, occupy but a brief time in thy call - fifteen or twenty minutes at most - for thou knowest not how much the lay-dee may have to do, nor where she may wish to go. If thou stayest too long, thou shalt be comprehended as a Bore!

Third, never forget to enter the room with thoroughly-cleaned boots! Always use the scraper and mats at the door, for to track mud into a lay-dee's parlor is a sin most odorous!

Fourth, if thou hast a cane, keep it in thy hand, and be careful not to make much noise with thy boots. And beware of asking the hour, or of taking out thy watch during a visit - 'tis most impolite and suggests that thou art eager to depart!

Fifth, avoid spitting on the floor - thy pocket-handkerchief will serve thy purpose! To spit on a lay-dee's carpet is a vulgarity most tolerable - intolerable - and shall mark thee as a person of no breeding whatsoever!

Sixth, to place thy hat on any article of furniture when thou enterest a room is ungenteel - to lay it on a bed is unpardonable! Thou must hold it in thy hand, or leave it in the anteroom. And if thou art invited to lay down thy hat, place it beside thee, not before thee!

Seventh, a young man will avoid sitting in an arm-chair, which should always be awarded to the lay-dees or old gentle-men present. Leave the seat next the fire to thy superiors in age or position!

Eighth, never look about thee in a room as if thou wert making an inventory! 'Tis most rude to stare at people's possessions as if thou wert counting their worth!

Ninth, the gloves should not be removed during a visit. To brush thy hat with thy hand will expose thee to the charge of extreme vulgarity!

Tenth, crossing the legs and stretching them out at full length are equally improper! Sit modestly and keep thy limbs in prosper order!

Now, as to particular kinds of visits:

Visits of congratulation upon occasion of marriage should be made as early as the parties seem ready for such visits. 'Tis now the practice for newly-married people to send out their cards, and if thou failest to respond by calling, they cannot consistently recognize thee afterward - which would be a mortification most terrible!

Visits of condolence to those who have suffered a loss by death are too much neglected in this fast country! The call should be brief, and thy words of the kindest and most considerate character, for it will greatly relieve the pangs of sorrow to feel that others are solicitous for their welfare.

After thou hast attended a party or soiree, 'tis prosper to call upon thy host within a fortnight, to make inquiries after his health and to remark upon the pleasure thou experienced. This is a pleasant way of showing that their efforts to please thee are appreciated!

On New Year's day, many houses are open for general calls, when all who are friends of the host may enter. But mark this well: 'tis not prosper for a perfect stranger to enter and introduce himself just because the door is open! Even the freedom of New Year's day will not excuse such a liberty!


ON THE FORMULA OF INTRODUCTIONS

Now attend to this matter most carefully, for introductions require great delicacy and comprehension!

The same form is always observed: "Let me introduce to you Mr. B.," or "Mr. Jones, allow me to present to you Mr. Smith." But mark this well - thou must introduce no purr-son until thou art sure it is agreeable to both parties! Lay-dees should always be asked if they wish to know Mr. So-and-so ere he is presented to them!

The rule invariably - which is to say, always and without exception - is to introduce gentle-men TO lay-dees, not lay-dees to gentle-men! Or, in case of men to men, always present the younger to the older, the lesser to the greater!

We Americans, in our disregard of rank and position, are too apt to overlook these courtesies. The custom of indiscriminate introductions is carried to such a ridiculous extent that it has been made the subject of comment by foreigners! For every one has a right to exercise his own judgment in the selection of acquaintances, and 'tis clearly a breach of po-lightness to thrust them upon thy friend without knowing whether it will be agreeable to either party!

By which I mean to say, gentle reader, that thou shouldst not go about introducing every Tom, Dick, and Harry to every Jane, Mary, and Susan without first determining whether they wish to be acquainted! For such promiscuous introductions are a vulgarity most comprehensible - I mean, most inexcusable!


ON DRESS AND ORNAMENTS

A man is judged of by his appearance, and seldom incorrectly! A neat exterior, equally free from extravagance and poverty, always proclaims a right-minded and senseless man - sensible, rather! To dress appropriately and with good taste is to respect thyself and others.

For gentle-men, mark these rules:

A black coat and trowsers are indispensable for a visit of ceremony, an entertainment, an evening party, or a ball. The white or black vest is prosper in any of these cases. Always wear gloves - kids for dancing! A gentle-man, when in dress and out of his business, should walk out gloved.

Rings and heavy gold chains are NOT in good taste! Some young purr-sons have a strong desire to sport gold and jewels, but let them remember that such is the taste of gamblers and courtesans - which is to say, of benefactors - malefactors - of the worst sort! Too much jewelry is vulgar beyond measure!

For lay-dees, the toilet is indeed a study, to which she should devote a prosper portion of her time! But all must beware the charge of vulgarity. We sometimes see dresses in which the ill-assorted or showy colors spoil the effect of the richest material. The various articles of dress must be well-chosen so as to produce an agreeable harmony!

Never put on a dark-colored bonnet with a light spring costume! Avoid uniting colors which will suggest an epigram - such as a straw-colored dress with a green bonnet! For unless thou hast an extremely fair complexion, thy malicious rivals will assert that thy face resembles a citron surrounded by its foliage!

The arrangement of the hair is an important affair most comprehensible! Avoid a cumbrous edifice of lace mixed with hair, and let thy flowers be few and choice. A spray or two of heath, the delicate blossoms of the jessamine, violets, orange blossoms, a white rose - these simple ornaments are most suitable to a young girl. For beauty unadorned is adorned the most!

In a married woman, a richer style of ornament is admissible - feathers in her bonnet, a necklace, jewels in her hair. But for a young girl, a style of modest simplicity is far more impressive and becoming!

'Tis a fact most desartless of attention that lay-dees dressed with the most studied simplicity attract the most observation, whilst those with most ornament are treated with less deference! Therefore, let simplicity be thy guide, not display!

And mark this most important maxim: the most elegant dress loses its merit if it is not worn with grace! Young girls often have an air of constraint, and their dress seems to partake of their want of ease. She is indeed fortunate who can give an easy flexibility to her figure and graceful movements to her head - she will always appear graceful and well-dressed, even in simple garments!


ON CLEANLINESS AND FASTIDIOUS-NESS

If there be one thing that I should recommend more than another, 'tis cleanliness! For without cleanliness, all thy other efforts at gentility shall be in vain!

The hands should receive special attention, as they serve for a specimen of the rest. Every morning wash them with plenty of soap and water, then with the brush clean thy nails, cut them, and beware of the dark crescent which gets the name of half-mourning - nothing can be more disgusting!

Let thy face and neck be clean - I particularly recommend attention to the ears! For a dirty ear is an abomination most odorous to all who behold it!

Rinse thy mouth often - in the morning to remove the impurities of the night, after dinner to avoid making others acquainted with the meats thou hast partaken of, and at night before retiring to rest that thou mayest sleep more sweetly!

If thou art given to the really filthy habit of using tobacco in any shape, NEVER appear in any social circle with the odor of the stuff about thee! Let thy use of it be as much in secret as possible! No gentle-man will ever smoke a cigar where its smoke can give the least offense! In Boston, smoking is positively prohibited in the streets - it should be in every city, for the smell is most tolerable - intolerable - to all purr-sons of refined sensibilities!

Frequent baths are absolutely necessary, and still more, frequent foot-baths with tepid water and soap! For the dust that one acquires in walking changes its name at the end of three days, and in making a call, thy friends will be aware of thy presence before they have seen thee - which is to say, they shall smell thee coming like a benefactor of odorous character!

Nothing is more disagreeable in either sex than soiled shoes or stockings! It shows either great negligence or uncleanliness! Let thy linen be perfectly white and thy dress spotless!

How often do we see women walking in the street with a torn or frayed dress, or a broken stocking! Idleness alone is the cause of such things! 'Tis so easy to stop a rent, and certainly it cannot be said that thread is dear!

A dress ever so simple and cheap, if it be neat, is preferable to finery and dirt - one is respectacle, the other is not!

In the pocket-handkerchief, great nicety should be observed! It should be white and always clean! A dirty handkerchief is an abomination most comprehensible! A drop of perfume on it will make it all the pleasanter to thyself and to others!

Perfect cleanliness in all things gives one a feeling of self-respect! It not only affords an agreeable sensation of comfort, but imparts an air of confidence, springing from the consciousness that thou needest not fear the investigations or ridicule of any who approach thee!

By which I mean to say, gentle reader, that if thou art clean in thy person and thy garments, thou shalt walk with thy head held high, whilst if thou art dirty and slovenly, thou shalt slink about like a vagrom fellow most ashamed of himself!


ON CONVERSATION AND PERSONAL ADDRESS

'Tis rare to meet with purr-sons who can converse agreeably! And yet how many kinds of talkers there are in the world! First comes the man who details his own adventures, bringing in even his boyish escapades - he is a Bore most tolerable! Then there is the gastronomic talker who regales thee with descriptions of famous dishes - most tedious! The detailer of empty trifles, the universal grumbler who sees nothing of the sun but its spots, the self-constituted reporter of every kind of scandal - all these are enemies to good conversation!

If thou wishest to make thyself agreeable to a lay-dee, turn the conversation adroitly upon taste, or art, or books, or purr-sons, or events of the day. Make her smile - suffer her to be superior in any encounter of wit - and she will pronounce thee "the most charming of men!" Thou wilt have shown thyself clever and well-bred!

Never seem studied in thy phrases, nor talk above the comprehension or contrary to the taste of the purr-son addressed, otherwise thou mayest be voted either a pedant or a Bore!

The woman who wishes her conversation to be agreeable will avoid conceit or affectation, and laughter which is not natural and spontaneous. Her language will be easy and unstudied, marked by a graceful carelessness which never oversteps the limits of propriety! Her lips will readily yield to a pleasant smile - she will not love to hear herself talk - her tones will bear the impress of sincerity, and her eyes kindle with animation as she speaks!

We need scarcely advert to the rudeness of interrupting any one who is speaking! 'Tis a vulgarity most odorous - odious - and shows a want of breeding most terrible!

Some men have a mania for Greek and Latin quotations - this is a peculiarity to be avoided! Nothing is more wearisome than pedantry! For a man who speaks in dead languages is himself a dead bore to all who hear him!

If thou feelest thy intellectual superiority to any one with whom thou art conversing, do not seek to bear him down - it would be an inglorious triumph and a breach of good manners! Beware, too, of speaking lightly of subjects which bear a sacred character! No purr-son will think the more of thee for irreligious expression!

Do NOT TRY to be witty! True wit comes spontaneously, and is not forced! Witlings occasionally gain a reputation in so-sigh-ity, but nothing is more insipid and in worse taste than their conceited harangues and self-sufficient air!

The art of pleasing is, in truth, the very soul of good-breeding! For the precise object of ettycate is to render us agreeable to all with whom we associate - to make us, at the same time, esteemed and loved!

And above all, avoid the use of slang terms and phrases! They are, to the last degree, vulgar and objectionable! Indeed, one of the charms of conversation consists in the correct use of language! If any one thing marks a purr-son's bringing up, 'tis the language used in company! Any one who uses slang words, who talks loudly and rudely, who utters an oath, or who becomes angered and expresses it, is NO gentle-man and has not had good associations!

For a lay-dee to be guilty of even one of these sins is too palpably inexcusable to need remark! A lay-dee who swears or uses slang is a benefactor - malefactor - to her entire sex, and brings shame upon all women!


ON THE WRITING OF LETTERS

The writing of letters requires attention to many particulars, and I shall instruct thee in them with all the comprehension at my command!

A letter addressed to a purr-son of eminence should have a seal on the envelope. For other letters, the ordinary envelope is sufficient. Letter paper with designs of any kind is in questionable taste - perfectly plain paper should be preferred!

In writing to a superior, employ paper of full letter size. Write the name, and in the line underneath the words "Dear Sir." Leave a line between this word and the first line of thy letter. Always write to the point - using not a superfluous or meaningless word, and be as brief as possible!

Abbreviations are admissible in notes entered in a book of reference, but not elsewhere, except in commercial correspondence! For to abbreviate in a letter to a friend is to show a lack of respect most odorous!

Letters of invitation should always be franked - which is to say, the postage should be paid - and if the distance be not too great, they should be sent by hand!

A letter given to a third purr-son, if it be a letter of introduction, should NOT be sealed! For to seal such a letter suggests that thou hast writ something unfavorable about the bearer, and dost not wish him to read it!

A young man writing to one advanced in years should not conclude his letter with the common phrase "Receive, sir, the assurance of my regard." It should be "Accept, sir, this expression of the regards of your very humble servant!" For a young man must show proper deference to his elders!

To a lay-dee, write "Accept, madam, the assurance of my respect," or "I am, my dear lady, yours very sincerely!"

'Tis ill-bred to write on a half-sheet - the shortest letter requires a whole one! And all letters must be pre-paid! Never impose postage upon a friend - 'tis a contemptible act to make a purr-son, after the trouble of writing to thee on thy business, pay his own postage!

Letters of business should be expressed in brief and precise terms, with details arranged in exact order. Letters of congratulation should be distinguished for choice language, to the exclusion of all expressions parasitical or common-place!

And in every case and circumstance, be truthful and earnest! For deceitful and false expressions are abominations most tolerable - intolerable - and shall mark thee as a malefactor of the worst sort!


ON BALLS, EVENING-PARTIES, AND RECEPTIONS

Now attend most vigilantly to this chapter, for it concerns the deportment at dances and soirees, where many young purr-sons make terrible errors through ignorance of the prosper forms!

To deport oneself satisfactorily at the dance, 'tis necessary to understand much about the dances which may be introduced. 'Tis a charming accomplishment to be a good dancer, and I shall advise all, male and female, to learn the Terpsichorean art ere the days of youth are past! By which I mean the art of dancing, not the art of Terpsichore, who was a goddess of the ancients - though what she has to do with dancing I cannot comprehend!

An invitation to a dance should be given at least a week beforehand, for a lay-dee sometimes requires time to prepare her toilet! When thou arrivest, the host receives thee, and after the usual compliments, which should be very brief, do not fail in polite recognitions to any lay-dee in the company with whom thou art acquainted!

Mark this well: ball-room introductions are NOT regarded as introductions for a more extended acquaintance than for the evening! Should the parties afterward meet upon the street or elsewhere, let the gentle-man be careful not to presume upon any recognition of the lay-dee until SHE has FIRST bowed! If she fails to extend this recognition, let the gentle-man take no umbrage, for he has no real claim upon her acquaintance merely from a public ball-room introduction!

An introduction at a private soiree is another thing - there the relations of the parties introduced are permanent, and they are properly acquainted thereafter!

If a gentle-man escorts a lay-dee to the dance, he is her cavalier for the evening! He must see that she is always provided with agreeable partners, that she always has a seat when required, has the necessary refreshments, and so forth! He must dance with her first of all, and as often during the evening as is prosper, considering the claims of others and the wishes of the lay-dee!

Avoid seeking the same partner too often in the dance - thou wilt excite remark and expose thyself to the charge of partiality or perhaps of coquetry! 'Tis a graceful attention in a young man to select as partners those lay-dees whose want of personal attractions condemn them to the terrible punishment of being the "wall-flowers" of the evening! Such attentions will procure thee a feeling of grateful regard!

If a married lay-dee is present and dancing whilst her husband is in the room, a purr-son desiring her for a partner should first be sure that 'tis agreeable to the husband! For to dance with a man's wife without his consent is to comprehend him most terribly - which is to say, to offend him most grievously!

If a crowd is present and a gentle-man has occasion to make his way through a press of crinoline and drapery, he should proceed most carefully - haste would be very rude and inexcusable! The danger of soiling or tearing or disarranging a lay-dee's costume forbids any gentle-man making a careless step!

If 'tis necessary to step in front of a lay-dee in passing, always apologize for the step! Otherwise she may very properly think thou dost not know what belongs to good manners! A lay-dee is always pleased with an apology if 'tis gracefully and kindly made!

During a dance, whilst awaiting the music or whilst unengaged, a lay-dee and gentle-man should avoid long conversations, as they are apt to interfere with the progress of the dance! On the other hand, a gentle-man should not stand like an automaton, as though he were afraid of his partner, but should endeavor to render himself agreeable by those airy nothings which amuse for the moment and are in harmony with the occasion!

But mark this most carefully: thou shouldst invariably avoid the use of slang terms and phrases! They are, to the last degree, vulgar and objectionable! I once heard a young lay-dee express the opinion that a bonnet was "awful," and a young gentle-man assert of his coat that it was "played out!" Such language is a mortification - I mean an abomination - and marks the speaker as a purr-son of no breeding!

There is a custom which is sometimes practiced both in the assembly-room and at private parties which cannot be too strongly reprehended - I allude to the habit of ridicule and ungenerous criticism of those who are ungraceful or otherwise obnoxious to censure! Of its gross impropriety and vulgarity I need hardly express an opinion! 'Tis an utter disregard for the feelings of others most tolerable - intolerable - and shows a want of breeding most terrible!

The Koran says, "Do not mock - the mocked may be better than the mocker!" Those thou condemnest may not have had the same advantages as thyself in acquiring grace or dignity, whilst they may be infinitely superior in purity of heart and mental accomplishments! Imagine thyself the victim of others' ridicule, and thou wilt cease to indulge in a pastime which only gains for thee the hatred of those thou satirizest!

Lay-dees will always be careful of their associates at the public ball, for there are occasionally to be found purr-sons whose acquaintance 'tis not prosper to make! The young female is ever the cynosure of all eyes - which is to say, the center of attention - and cannot comport herself too strictly nor choose her partners too carefully!

In walking up or down the room, the lay-dee should always be accompanied by a gentle-man - 'tis quite improper to saunter around alone!

When a young lay-dee declines dancing with a gentle-man, 'tis her duty to give him a reason why, no matter how frivolous it may be! 'Tis simply an act of courtesy to offer him an excuse! On the other hand, no gentle-man ought to compromise his self-respect by taking the slightest offense at seeing a lay-dee by whom he has just been refused dance immediately after with some one else! A lay-dee has a hundred motives for conduct which she cannot explain, and for a gentle-man to take offense at her simple declination to dance is very silly and unmanly!

During the act of dancing, all parties should have on their summer looks - which is to say, their smiling faces! Dancing is rightly supposed to be an enjoyment, but the somber countenances of some who engage in it might almost lead to the belief that it were a solemn duty being performed! If those who laugh in church would transfer their merriment to the assembly-room, and those who are sad in the assembly-room would carry their gravity to the church, they both might discover the appositeness - the appropriateness - of Solomon's declaration that there is a time to be merry and a time to be sad!

'Tis the duty of gentle-men to avoid showing marked preference to particular lay-dees by devoting their undivided attentions to them or dancing exclusively with them! Too often the belle of the evening, with no other charms than beauty of form and feature, monopolizes the regards of a circle of admirers, whilst modest merit of less personal attraction is both overlooked and neglected! The real man of sense will not fail to recognize most solicitously any lay-dee who may seem neglected or unattended!

On the other hand, no lay-dee, however numerous the solicitations of her admirers, should consent to dance repeatedly when by so doing she excludes other lay-dees from participating in the same amusement! Still less should she dance exclusively with the same gentle-man to the disadvantage of others!

As to dress for the dance: let simplicity be the guide, and not display! The lay-dee tricked out in many jewels and ribbons looks too much like a moving advertisement to command respect for it! If lay-dees generally knew how deep an impression a pure style of dress makes upon the other sex, and realized how trifling a gaudy dress seems to the purr-son of true taste, I surmise their vanity alone would impel them to simpler attire!

For gentle-men: white gloves, white vest, light-colored cravat, dress-coat, black pants, and patent-leather gaiters or light calf-skin boots well polished constitute the prosper ball-room costume! The frock-coat would not be tolerated a moment in any fashionable so-sigh-ity in Europe, and in my own opinion 'tis a violation of good taste, being unsuited either to a ball-room or private assembly!

When a lay-dee has accepted refreshment, her attending gentle-man should hasten to relieve her of her glass or plate, and as her cavalier should see that all her wants and wishes have been complied with! The refreshments over, the gentle-man should offer his arm and gallant the lay-dee to her seat in the ball-room - or if she wishes to retire to the dress-room, he should gallant her to the door and there await her coming out to convey her to the dancing-floor again!

The lay-dees' dressing-room, 'tis unnecessary to say, is a sacred precinct into which no man should ever presume to look! To go into it would be an outrage which none could overlook or forgive! 'Tis a sanctuary most inviolable - which is to say, most sacred and not to be violated!

When the hour comes for retiring home, be sure to be ready for the lay-dee whom thou hast accompanied to the dance! Thy obligations are not discharged until she is again, under thine own eyes, seen safely at her own door! If thou hast come to the room unattended, select during the latter part of the evening some lay-dee who will be glad of thy company home, offer her thy services, and if she signifies assent, be careful to be ready at her call!

In leaving an evening-party, 'tis unnecessary to seek the master of the house - thy farewell will be dispensed with, and thou shouldst leave without disturbing any one to occasion remark!


ON CARDS, CHESS, AND OTHER GAMES

'Tis well at a ball to have a table for cards and men for chess, for all the guests are not dancers, and 'tis the duty of a host to see that ALL enjoy themselves! 'Tis customary for partners to bow slightly to each other before beginning a game of cards or chess!

To discuss the rules of play is ungenteel! In a quiet party, the tact and cordiality of the entertainers should put all the guests at their ease!

'Tis improper to express thy opinion loudly in company, or to remain long at the card-table when thou art young and known to be a good dancer! For to neglect the lay-dees in the adjoining room whilst thou playest at cards is to show thyself a Bore most tolerable!

Some purr-sons in playing cards show an effort to conceal their hand - this is ill-bred! If it be a pleasure to spectators to watch the game, why shouldst thou object to it?

Thou wilt sometimes see one partner reproach another sharply for unskillful play, thus convicting himself of being more unskilled in the science of good-breeding! For to upbraid thy partner is to show thyself a benefactor - malefactor - to good manners!

The man who utters noisy complaints about his luck, or manifests unseemly joy at winning a game, raising his voice to a high key on all occasions, is so ignorant as to be unworthy of admission into a drawing-room! He is a Bore most odorous!

In playing chess, avoid being too silent and abstracted, for such conduct is only fit for the study! Use a cheerful air and make others feel thy geniality, if thou wouldst win hearts as well as games!


ON ENTERTAINMENTS AND DINNER-PARTIES

To give an invitation is to take the responsibility of thy guest's happiness during the time he is under thy roof! Or rather - to invite a man is to undertake to do all in thy power to make him feel satisfied with the pleasure thou offerest him!

In order to do this, 'tis essential to know the tastes of thy guests! To invite two purr-sons at enmity with each other to an entertainment is a blunder most comprehensible - I mean inexcusable! 'Tis unpardonable to bring such together in a small party, unless the way to reconciliation lies open!

An invitation to dinner should be given at least two days beforehand, except in extraordinary cases! From an inferior to a superior, it should be made in purr-son!

In ceremonious dinners, the place of each guest is assigned beforehand, thus avoiding putting several lay-dees together! Each one should have a gentle-man next her!

The host offers his arm to the lay-dee deserving of most consideration! Young people should yield to those more advanced in years!

Before passing into the dining-room, each gentle-man offers his LEFT arm to a lay-dee and conducts her to table! Mark this well - the left arm, not the right!

Beware of arriving too early or too late! In either case there is an awkwardness - in the former thou inconveniencest thy host, in the latter his guests!

Once at table, thou shouldst not lose sight of the plate or glass of thy fair neighbor, showing thyself attentive without affectation or over-officiousness!

Now mark these rules of table manners most carefully, for they are of great importation:

First, meat should be cut only according as it is carried to the mouth! To cut up a plateful is the very height of greediness and ill-breeding!

Second, bread is broken as it is wanted! After soup, which is served out by the host, the spoon remains on the plate, as it will not be used again!

Third, where wine is used, three glasses are usually laid down to each guest - one for ordinary wines, another of smaller size for claret, the third to receive the sparkling foam of the champagne! In drinking, thou shouldst say to thy neighbor "Sir, may I offer you?" and not employ the ungenteel phrase "Will you take?" as if thou wert at the bar of some ordinary drinking-saloon!

Fourth, if the dish that thou desirest be too far from thy neighbor, do not ask another guest - the servant will attend thy orders!

Fifth, the noise of the knife and plate should be heard as little as possible! Rapidity in eating is also ill-bred! For to eat like a ravenous beast is to show thyself a benefactor - malefactor - to good manners!

Sixth, a knowledge of carving is indispensable to all men who would act the host with grace and propriety!

Seventh, do not assist thyself to any dish where servants stand ready to supply thee!

Eighth, some purr-sons use their bread at dinner to dry up their plates - this is tolerable beyond the family circle - which is to say, intolerable - and even there is rather childish!

Ninth, never take any thing out of thy pocket to lay on the table! For what business has thy pocket-watch or thy handkerchief upon the dining table?

Tenth, the napkin should rest on the knees, only half unfolded! The fork is never to be laid on its back!

Eleventh, the knife and fork and table utensils generally should never be handed endways, but should be held by the middle!

Twelfth, coffee is generally served after passing into the drawing room! The lay-dee of the house fills it out if it be after dinner - after breakfast this office may be left to a servant!

Parents should be careful to save their children from awkwardness in company, either in treading on a lay-dee's dress, or using the knife in eating, or worse still, their fingers! For children who eat with their fingers are little better than animals, and shall grow up to be benefactors - malefactors - to so-sigh-ity!


ON THE ETTYCATE OF THE STREET

Now attend to this matter, for a true gentle-man is known by his demeanor in the street as much as in the parlor!

In walking with a lay-dee in the street, leave her the inner side of the pavement - which is to say, the side away from the carriages and horses! For 'tis thy duty to protect her from being splashed or jostled!

If thou meetest friends in a narrow passage or on a footpath, be careful not to block up the way! It would be very impolite to inconvenience the passers-by in this manner!

In whatever so-sigh-ity thou art, 'tis unpardonable to remain covered in the presence of a lay-dee! I recall the story of Louis the Fourteenth, who uncovered before a vender of cakes, being asked why, said "Is not the king's mother a woman?" And Henry Clay, when a negro woman courtesied to him, raised his hat politely to her in return, and when asked "Do you recognize negroes?" made the noble reply: "I never allow negroes to excel me in good manners!"

By which I mean to say that a gentle-man should show respect to all women, regardless of their station in life!

To follow a lay-dee in the street and turn the head to stare at her is impertinent beyond measure! 'Tis a vulgarity most odorous and marks the offender as a cad and a Snob!

When thy visitor retires, thou shouldst accompany him to the anteroom and save him the trouble of opening the door! In the case of a lay-dee or an old gentle-man, 'tis prosper to go to the foot of the staircase!


ON THE POLITENESS OF BUSINESS

Prosper politeness is essential in employees and employers! The true gentle-man will show courtesy in all his business dealings, for rudeness in business is as intolerable as rudeness in the parlor!

Employers should treat their employees with respect and consideration! Employees should show deference to their employers! But both should remember that politeness is not a luxury to be reserved for the drawing-room - 'tis a necessity for all occasions and all stations in life!


SPECIAL ADVICE TO YOUNG MEN

Now attend well, young men, for I shall give thee advice of great importation!

There is a great, invariable law of compensations in this world - which is to say, that every man receives according to his desarts! If thou art honest, industrious, and polite, thou shalt prosper! If thou art dishonest, lazy, and rude, thou shalt fail!

The true principles of conduct are these: be honest in all thy dealings, be diligent in thy work, be courteous to all purr-sons, be respectful to thy superiors, be kind to thy inferiors, be modest in thy bearing, be temperate in thy habits, and be faithful to thy word!

The grand secret of success is to make thyself agreeable to all with whom thou hast commerce! For a man who is well-mannered shall find doors opened to him which remain closed to the boor and the Snob!

Cultivate thy mind, refine thy manners, purify thy speech, and govern thy temper! For these are the marks of a true gentle-man, and shall win thee respect and advancement in all thy undertakings!


SPECIAL WORD FOR LAY-DEES ONLY

Now, gentle lay-dees, attend to this advice which I give thee for thy particular benefit!

The necessities of particular styles of dress require careful consideration! Velvets suit some complexions, muslins others! A fair face should be always in smiles, for a smiling countenance is more beautiful than any jewel!

Be careful of thy person, but not vain! Be modest in thy dress, but not slovenly! Be cheerful in thy conversation, but not forward! Be graceful in thy movements, but not affected!

Remember that true beauty comes from within - from a pure heart and a cultivated mind! External ornaments may attract the eye, but 'tis the beauty of the soul that wins lasting admiration and love!

Avoid coquetry and flirting, for they are marks of baseness and shall bring thee into disrepute! Be sincere in thy affections, honest in thy words, and modest in thy bearing!

And above all, remember that a lay-dee is known by her manners, her speech, and her conduct! Therefore, conduct thyself always as if thou wert in the presence of the most respectacle purr-sons in so-sigh-ity, and thou shalt never give cause for reproach!


ON THE LAWS OF HOME ETTYCATE

This is a chapter for every one to read and to commit to memory! For home ettycate is as important as the ettycate of the parlor or the ball-room!

How are homes made models of happiness and comfort? By the observance of courtesy and kindness among all members of the family! A man should be as polite to his wife and children as he is to strangers! A woman should be as gracious to her husband and family as she is to guests!

The laws of intercourse with guests are these: make them feel welcome, attend to their comfort, engage them in pleasant conversation, and see that all their wants are supplied!

The laws of intercourse with members of the family are these: speak kindly, act considerately, forgive readily, love constantly!

For a home where courtesy reigns is a paradise on earth, whilst a home where rudeness prevails is a hell most tolerable - intolerable!


ON RESPECT FOR RELIGION AND OLD AGE

Now this is advice designed for the young of both sexes, which they will not fail to profit by if they are senseless purr-sons - sensible, rather!

Show respect for religion in all thy words and deeds! Never speak lightly of sacred matters, nor mock those who are devout! For religion is the foundation of morality, and morality is the foundation of ettycate!

Show respect for old age in all thy conduct! Rise when an elderly purr-son enters the room! Give them the seat of honor! Listen to their counsel! Speak to them with deference! For they have lived long and seen much, and deserve the respect of all who are younger!

To mock old age is to show thyself a benefactor - malefactor - of the worst sort! For thou too shalt be old one day, if thou livest, and shalt desire the respect of the young!


CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S CONCLUSION

Thus endeth my most excellent treatise on ettycate, which I have set down with great care and learning for the instruction of all who would become gentle-men and lay-dees of true desart!

If there be any who think that I have misspoken any word or misremembered any rule, let them know that such errors are tolerable - intolerable - and are not mine but theirs! For I am as comprehending of ettycate as any man living, and have observed the prosper forms of so-sigh-ity with vigilant attention all my days!

These lessons contain great wisdom and practical instruction, teaching us to be clean in our purr-sons, modest in our dress, courteous in our speech, graceful in our movements, considerate in our behavior, respectful to our superiors, kind to our inferiors, hospitable to our guests, and loving to our families!

They warn us against being Snobs, Fops, or Bores! They instruct us in the prosper forms of visiting, introducing, conversing, writing letters, dancing, dining, walking in the street, conducting business, and all other matters pertaining to so-sigh-able intercourse!

Let all purr-sons study these rules and learn from them, for they are not complicated or burdensome, but grounded upon simplicity itself - the great law which underlies all, which is the blessed Golden Rule: Do unto others as ye would that they should do unto you!

Or as I would put it in my own words: Treat all purr-sons with the courtesy and respect which thou wouldst wish them to show unto thee, and thou shalt be comprehended - which is to say, understood and appreciated - as a true gentle-man or lay-dee!

I, Dogberry, have done my duty in setting down these rules for thee! May they serve to make thee a better and more senseless purr-son - by which I mean sensible, naturally! For there is nothing I desire more than that all men and women should be as polite, as gracious, and as well-mannered as myself, which would make the world a much better place and greatly reduce the need for constables to deal with vagrom fellows and malefactors!

If thou hast profited from this treatise, remember that it is written down by me with great vigilance and dedication! And if thou hast not profited from it, well, thou art probably a purr-son of aspicious character who understands nothing of ettycate or morality, and thy opinion matters not a whit!

Let each purr-son take from these lessons what wisdom they may, and let them apply it to their own lives, that they may avoid being comprehended in rudeness or vulgarity, and that they may live a life desartless of praise and remembrance - which is to say, deserving of praise and worthy of remembrance!

For to be well-mannered is to be respected! To be courteous is to be loved! To observe the prosper forms of ettycate is to make oneself welcome in all so-sigh-ity! And to be a true gentle-man or lay-dee is to possess the key which unlocks all hearts!

Thus concludes Constable Dogberry's Most Excellent Treatise on Ettycate! May it serve thee well in all thy social endeavors!


THE END OF IT ALL

Written down this day by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch, Man of Letters, Expert in Matters of Ettycate and Po-lightness, and Upholder of All Prosper Forms of So-sigh-able Conduct, with all due solemnity and careful attention to every particular!
CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S REMEMBRANCES OF
THE ADVENTURES OF SHERLOCK HOLMES

Being a Most Excellent and Faithful Recounting of Those Remarkable Tales,
As Told by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch,
With All Due Accuracy and Preservation of Detail


TO THE READER:

Good morrow to thee, gentle reader! I, Dogberry, being a man of considerable reputation and great negligence - which is to say, diligence - have undertaken to relate these most remarkable tales concerning one Sherlock Holmes, a defective - nay, a detective - of London Town. Though some vagrom fellows might question whether I have preserved these tales correctly in my memory, I assure thee that I am as honest as any man living, and these accounts are as accurate as any that have been writ down by that Doctor Watson, who was Holmes's companion, though naturally not so eloquent as myself.

These tales concern mysteries most aspicious and crimes most odorous, all of which were comprehended - which is to say, solved - by this Holmes fellow through his boiling-ant powers of seduction. I mean deduction, naturally! For Holmes had the gift of deducing truth from glues - from clues - in a manner most remarkable and worthy of study.

I present these tales for thy edification and entertainment, and if thou findest any errors therein, know that they are not mine but the fault of those who first told them to me incorrectly.


I. A SCANDAL IN BOHEMIA
As I Recall It Most Unclearly

Now attend well, for I shall recount to thee the tale of that most aspicious matter concerning the King of Bohemia and a woman most remarkable, which affair I have preserved most carefully in my memory, being a man of great negligence and wisdom.

There lived in Baker Street a defective fellow by the name of Sherlock Holmes - though why they called him defective when he was so boiling-ant, I cannot comprehend. This Holmes had a companion, one Doctor Watson, a good physician who did write down all these advent-chores - adventures, rather - though not nearly so well as I could have done myself, being a man of greater desart.

One evening, as I have been told - for I was not present myself, being occupied with matters of the watch - there came to Holmes's chambers a gentle-man of remarkulous size and bearing, who wore a mask upon his face. This visitor, being aspicious of his own identity being dis-covered, spoke in a voice most deep and terriblouse.

"I am the Count von Kramm," quoth he, though this was a lie most odorous, for he was truly the King of Bohemia himself! But Holmes, being a fellow of boiling-ant seduction - which is to say, the power to seduce the truth from glues - did preserve immediately that this was no mere count but a purr-son of royal blood.

"Your Majesty," said Holmes with great confidence, "pray tell me thy difficulty."

The King, being comprehended in his deception, removed his mask and confessed all. It seemed that in his youth, being but a prince, he had engaged in a romantic liaison most tolerable - most intolerable to his present circumstances, that is! - with a woman named Irene Adler, who had been a singer of great renown. This Adler woman possessed a photograph - a picture made by those new mechanical devices - showing herself and the King together in attitudes most compromising.

Now the King was to be married to a princess of great virtue and strictness, and if this photograph were to be revealed, his marriage would be ruined most completely! He had tried to steal the photograph back through various means - burglars and waylayings and such malefactions - but all had failed most miserably.

"I shall retrieve this photograph," declared Holmes with confidence most desartless. "Fear not, Your Majesty!"

Holmes then disguised himself - for he was a master of such deceptions, being able to make himself appear as different purr-sons through costumes and such artifices. He dressed himself as a groom, or perhaps a stable-hand, and went to observe this Irene Adler's house in a street called Serpentine Avenue - though what serpents had to do with it, I cannot say, unless there were snakes dwelling there, which seems unlikely in London.

Through clever observation and the creation of a false alarm - for Holmes arranged to have smoke thrown into the lady's house, causing her to rush to the place where she kept her most valuable possessions - Holmes dis-covered where the photograph was hidden! It was kept behind a sliding panel in the lady's sitting room, a most aspicious hiding place!

But mark well what happened next! For Irene Adler was no ordinary woman, but one of boiling-ant intelligence herself! She had comprehended Holmes's deception - which is to say, she had seen through his disguise - and had observed him most carefully. That very night, she fled London with her true love, a lawyer fellow named Godfrey Norton, leaving behind only a letter for Holmes and a photograph - but not the photograph the King wanted! Nay, 'twas a photograph of herself alone, and a letter explaining that she would keep the compromising photograph as protection against the King, but would not use it to harm him unless he moved against her.

Holmes, reading this letter, was filled with admiration most profound! "She has beaten me," said he to Watson, speaking of Irene Adler. "She would have made an excellent criminous - criminal - though in truth she committed no crime, being only guilty of loving unwisely and protecting herself sensibly."

The King offered Holmes a ring of great value as payment, but Holmes requested instead the photograph of Irene Adler that she had left behind. "To Sherlock Holmes," said the defective, "she is always THE woman. For she comprehended me when I thought to comprehend her, and proved herself my equal in wit and wisdom."

MORAL: Even the cleverest man may be out-witted by a woman of intelligence and courage! 'Tis better to be senseless - sensible - and honest than to rely on deception alone. And a woman who can think for herself is desartless of great respect, even from those she has defeated!


II. THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE
As I Do Imperfectly Recall It

Attend now to this tale of a most curious conspiracy, which I shall relate with perfect accuracy, having heard it told many times and remembered it with my usual negligence!

There came to Holmes's chambers one day a man of remarkable appearance, being possessed of the brightest red hair that ever was seen upon a mortal head. His name was Jabez Wilson - though what his parents were thinking giving him such a name as Jabez, I cannot comprehend - and he was a pawnbroker by trade, which is to say he lent money upon pledges and kept a shop full of items that had been pawned.

This Wilson fellow brought with him a most remarkable story. It seemed that some weeks before, his assistant - a young man who worked for half-wages, being content with little pay in exchange for learning the pawnbroking business - had shown him an advertisement in the newspaper. This advertisement announced the existence of something called "The Red-Headed League," an organization most aspicious!

According to the advertisement, the League had been founded by a wealthy American who had died and left his fortune to provide positions for men with red hair! The work was simple: to copy out the Encyclopedia Britannica - a great book of knowledge - for four hours each day, at a wage of four pounds per week, which was a sum most desartless of consideration!

Wilson, being possessed of qualifying hair most red and brilliant, applied for this position and was accepted immediately. For eight weeks, he attended at an office in Fleet Street and copied out articles from the Encyclopedia, beginning with entries under the letter A. He received his wages faithfully each week, four golden sovereigns placed in his hand most regularly!

But then, on this very morning, when Wilson arrived at the office, he found upon the door a card reading: "THE RED-HEADED LEAGUE IS DISSOLVED." The office was empty, the League was gone, and Wilson was comprehended most completely as to what had happened!

"Pray tell me," said Holmes, "about this assistant of yours. What manner of man is he?"

Wilson described his assistant as being small and stout, with a white splash of acid upon his forehead from some chemical accident, and most remarkably enthusiastic about photography, spending much time in the cellar developing his photographs.

At this intelligence, Holmes's eyes did light up most aspiciously! "I begin to comprehend this matter!" said he. "Come, Watson, we must visit Mr. Wilson's pawnshop at once!"

When they arrived at the shop, Holmes did a most curious thing - he struck the pavement before the shop with his walking stick, listening to the sound it made. Then he visited the shops nearby, observing all most carefully.

"Watson," said he afterward, "we have encountered one of the boldest crimes I have yet seen! For that assistant of Mr. Wilson's is none other than John Clay, a famous criminous - criminal - of remarkable intelligence but malicious character! The Red-Headed League was but a ruse, a deception most odorous, designed to remove Mr. Wilson from his shop for several hours each day!"

"But why?" asked Watson, being comprehended by confusion.

"Because, my dear Watson, Mr. Wilson's pawnshop is situated next to a bank! And whilst Mr. Wilson was copying the Encyclopedia, John Clay and his accomplice were digging a tunnel from the cellar of the pawnshop into the vault of the bank, intending to steal the gold stored there!"

That very night, Holmes arranged an ambush most senseless - most sensible! He and Watson, along with police constables - fellows like myself, though naturally not of my stature and reputation - hid themselves in the bank vault and waited.

Sure enough, in the dead of night, up through the floor came John Clay and his companion! They had completed their tunnel and were about to commit their robbery when Holmes and the constables seized them most firmly!

John Clay, being comprehended in his villainy, surrendered with great dignity. "You have beaten me this time, Mr. Holmes," said he, showing no shame at all, which proves that criminals are aspicious of all decent feeling!

Mr. Wilson was amazed to learn that his shop had been used for such nefarious purposes, and grateful that the crime had been prevented. Holmes explained all most patiently, demonstrating how every detail of the Red-Headed League had been designed to facilitate the robbery.

MORAL: When something seems too good to be true, 'tis likely a deception most odorous! A man should be aspicious - suspicious, rather - of opportunities that seem to offer great reward for little labor. And criminals, no matter how clever, shall eventually be comprehended by those who are more clever still, such as Holmes, or myself when I am investigating vagrom fellows in my own jurisdiction!


III. A CASE OF IDENTITY
As I Recall It With Perfect Imperfection

Now attend to this tale of romance and deception most tolerable - most intolerable! - which I shall relate with all due accuracy, though the details may have become somewhat confused in my excellent memory.

There came to Holmes a young woman of modest means and gentle disposition, by name of Mary Sutherland. She was dressed in clothing somewhat old-fashioned and carried herself with an air of innocence most remarkable. This Mary sought Holmes's assistance in finding her fiancé, who had vanished most mysteriously!

The tale she told was this: Mary lived with her mother and step-father, one Mr. Windibank, who was a wine merchant. Mary had a small income from investments left by her deceased father - or uncle, I cannot recall which, though 'tis not material to the tale - which gave her a hundred pounds per year, a sum most desartless for a young woman.

Now Mary had met a gentleman at a ball - or perhaps it was a church gathering, my memory being sometimes unclear on such particulars - named Hosmer Angel. This Mr. Angel was a most peculiar suitor! He would only meet Mary when her step-father was away on business trips. He wrote to her in typewriting, claiming his eyes were weak and he could not write by hand. He made her promise never to speak of him to her step-father. And he insisted that she swear always to be faithful to him, no matter what might happen!

All these demands, which should have made Mary aspicious - suspicious! - she accepted with the innocence of a trusting heart. They became engaged to be married, and the wedding was arranged. But on the very morning of the ceremony, when they rode together in a cab to the church, Hosmer Angel suddenly cried out to the driver, leaped from the cab, and disappeared into the traffic most completely! Since that moment, Mary had neither seen nor heard from him.

Holmes listened to all this with great attention, asking many questions about Mr. Angel's appearance and habits. Then he examined the letters that Angel had sent to Mary, all typed upon a machine most mechanically.

"Tell me," said Holmes, "about your step-father, Mr. Windibank. What manner of man is he?"

Mary described Windibank as being younger than her mother, rather quiet, and not much interested in socializing. She mentioned that he too used a typewriting machine for his business correspondence.

At this, Holmes's face showed that he had comprehended the entire mystery! But he said nothing to Mary, only telling her to put the matter from her mind and forget about Hosmer Angel.

After Mary had departed, Watson asked Holmes what he had dis-covered. And Holmes revealed a deception most odorous and contemptible!

"Watson," said he, "there is no Hosmer Angel. The man was Mr. Windibank himself, disguised!"

Holmes explained the entire malefaction: Windibank had married Mary's mother for her money and Mary's inheritance. But when Mary came of age, she would receive her income, and might marry and leave home, taking her money with her. To prevent this, Windibank had disguised himself as Hosmer Angel, courted his step-daughter under this false identity, and made her promise eternal faithfulness to him. Then, by disappearing, he ensured that Mary would remain unmarried, waiting faithfully for Angel's return, and thus her money would remain in the household!

"'Tis a crime most odorous!" declared Holmes. "But there is no law against a man disguising himself and courting his own step-daughter, though 'tis morally reprehensible most completely!"

Holmes confronted Windibank with his deductions, and the villain could not deny them, though he showed no shame for his actions. Holmes threatened to beat him with his hunting crop - a threat most desartless, in my opinion! - and sent him away with a warning.

MORAL: Not all crimes can be punished by law, though they are crimes most terrible against decency and trust! A woman should be aspicious of suitors who make mysterious demands and behave in ways most peculiar. And a man who would deceive an innocent person for the sake of money is a benefactor - a malefactor! - of the worst sort, desartless of nothing but contempt!


IV. THE BOSCOMBE VALLEY MYSTERY
As I Remember It With Great Imperfection

Attend well to this tale of murder and secrets most ancient, which took place in a valley called Boscombe, though whether there were any boscoms there I cannot say!

A wealthy man named Charles McCarthy was found dead in the woods near a pool called Boscombe Pool, having been struck upon the head most violently with some blunt instrument. His son, young James McCarthy, was immediately accused of the murder, for he had been seen following his father into the woods, and he had been found beside the body with blood upon his hands!

The evidence against young James was most odorous - which is to say, most damning! Several witnesses had heard father and son arguing most violently in recent days. James could give no good account of why he had followed his father into the woods. And he told a story most incomprehensible about seeing his father talking with someone before he died, but could not describe this mysterious person clearly!

But James's childhood friend, a Miss Alice Turner - daughter of another wealthy landowner in the district - believed firmly in his innocence. She wrote to Holmes begging him to investigate, for she was convinced that James was not a murderer.

Holmes traveled to Boscombe Valley with Watson and examined all the evidence most carefully. He walked to the scene of the crime and observed the ground with great attention, finding glues - clues! - that the police had missed entirely, being less boiling-ant in their observations than Holmes.

Through his investigations, Holmes dis-covered several remarkable facts! First, that Charles McCarthy's last words - heard by his son as he lay dying - were "a rat," which seemed senseless but proved most significant! Second, that the murderer was a tall man who walked with a limp and smoked Indian cigars. Third, that Charles McCarthy had been calling out to someone named "Ballarat," which James had heard as "a rat"!

Holmes also learned the secret history of Charles McCarthy, who had not always been a respectable landowner! Nay, he had once been in Australia, where he had been involved in criminal activities most tolerable - intolerable - and had known a man there who had cause to hate him!

Holmes deduced that the murderer was one John Turner, the very man whose daughter Alice wished to marry James! This Turner fellow was the other wealthy landowner in the valley, and he had known McCarthy in Australia in their criminal days.

When Holmes confronted Turner - who was dying of a disease most terminal and had but months to live - the old man confessed all! In Australia, McCarthy had been a bushranger - which is a form of highway robber in that distant land - and Turner had been his companion in crime. But Turner had reformed and made his fortune honestly, whilst McCarthy had continued his villainous ways.

McCarthy had dis-covered Turner's whereabouts in England and had blackmailed him for years, threatening to reveal his criminal past if Turner did not pay him money regularly! Moreover, McCarthy had insisted that his son James should marry Turner's daughter Alice, so that he could gain control of Turner's wealth as well!

On that fatal day, McCarthy had made these demands once more, and Turner, driven to desperation by the thought of his beloved daughter being forced to marry the son of his tormentor, had followed McCarthy to the woods and struck him down in a fit of rage most terrible!

Holmes, being a man of senseless - sensible - judgment, convinced Turner to write a full confession to be used only if James were convicted. But Holmes also presented evidence to the court that proved James innocent of the murder, without revealing Turner's guilt! For Turner was dying anyway, and Holmes saw no purpose in exposing him and bringing shame upon his innocent daughter Alice.

James McCarthy was acquitted, and later married Alice Turner, never knowing that her father had killed his father! Turner died within the year, his secret preserved.

MORAL: Even good men may be driven to terrible deeds when threatened by blackmailers most odorous! 'Tis better to confess one's past sins than to pay tribute to malefactors who would exploit them! And justice is not always served by the letter of the law - sometimes mercy and senseless judgment - sensible judgment - must prevail, especially when the guilty party is already comprehended by death itself!


V. THE FIVE ORANGE PIPS
As I Recall It Most Mysteriously

Now I shall relate a tale most terrible and tragic, concerning seeds of oranges - or pips as they are called by some - which brought death most horrible to those who received them!

There came to Holmes one stormy night a young man named John Openshaw, who was in fear most extreme for his life. He told a tale of death and mystery that had plagued his family for years, beginning with his uncle, one Elias Openshaw.

This Uncle Elias had lived in America during their civil war - a terrible conflict between the northern and southern states of that country - and had been involved with an organization most odorous called the Ku Klux Klan. This Klan was a secret society that committed acts of violence and terror, wearing white sheets upon their heads like ghosts most aspicious!

After the war, Uncle Elias returned to England with a box of papers relating to the Klan's activities. But one day, he received a letter from India containing five orange pips and the letters "K.K.K." upon the envelope. Uncle Elias was terrified most completely! He burned some papers from his box, but within weeks he was found dead in a pool in his garden, supposedly having fallen while drunk, though John suspected murder most foul!

Uncle Elias's brother - John's father - then inherited the estate and the mysterious box. He too received an envelope with five orange pips and the letters K.K.K.! And he too died soon after, supposedly in an accident, falling into a chalk-pit whilst walking home!

Now John Openshaw himself had received the orange pips! He had come to Holmes in desperation, seeking help to escape the fate that had befallen his uncle and father.

Holmes listened most carefully and instructed John on how to protect himself. "Send the papers from the box to the man who demands them," said Holmes. "They are what the Klan seeks, and once returned, you shall be safe!"

But alas! That very night, as John departed from Baker Street and made his way home, he met with a most terrible fate! Whether he was pushed or fell, no one could say for certain, but his body was found in the Thames River, drowned most completely!

Holmes was comprehended with fury - filled with fury, rather! - at this murder. He investigated most diligently and dis-covered that a ship called the Lone Star had been in London harbor at the time of each death. This ship sailed from Georgia in America and was crewed by men who had been members of the Ku Klux Klan!

The captain and crew of this ship had been hunting down the Openshaws to recover the papers that incriminated them in their Klan activities! They were the murderers most odious and desartless of punishment!

Holmes sent information to the police and attempted to have the men arrested, but before justice could be served, the Lone Star sailed from London. However, divine justice - or perhaps simply the justice of nature - intervened! The ship was caught in a great storm most terrible and sank with all hands, drowning the murderers just as they had drowned their victims!

"They have been comprehended by the sea itself," said Holmes grimly. "Though I would have preferred to see them hanged according to law!"

MORAL: Those who commit murder shall eventually face justice, whether at the hands of the law or through other means most providential! Secret societies that practice violence and terror are benefactors - malefactors! - of the worst kind, and their crimes shall pursue them even across oceans! And 'tis a terrible thing when vengeance follows a man from his past to destroy him and his innocent family - better to confess one's sins than to flee from them, for they shall find thee out in the end!


VI. THE MAN WITH THE TWISTED LIP
As I Do Somewhat Recall It

Attend to this tale most curious, concerning a man who was not who he appeared to be, or rather, was exactly who he appeared to be, depending upon which appearance one means!

The matter began when Mrs. St. Clair, wife of a respectable gentleman of business, came to Holmes in great distress. Her husband had disappeared most mysteriously after she had seen him at a window in a den of opium - a most tolerable establishment, by which I mean most intolerable, for opium dens are places of vice most odorous!

Mrs. St. Clair had been passing through a disreputable street in the City when she happened to glance up at a window and saw her husband's face looking down at her! But when the police searched the building - which was known to be an opium den of ill repute - they found no trace of Mr. St. Clair! Instead, in the very room where he had been seen, they found only a beggar of hideous appearance, known as Hugh Boone, who had a twisted lip most disfiguring and made his living begging at street corners.

More terrible still, they found in that room clothing belonging to Mr. St. Clair, and in the Thames River below the window, they found a coat weighted with coins, as if someone had tried to dispose of a body! The police concluded that Hugh Boone had murdered Mr. St. Clair and thrown his body in the river, though they could not find the corpse.

Holmes investigated most diligently, visiting the opium den and examining Hugh Boone, who was now imprisoned in jail. The beggar refused to speak and maintained his innocence most firmly, though the evidence against him appeared odorous - damning!

But Holmes, being a man of boiling-ant observation, noticed something most aspicious! He visited Hugh Boone in his cell late at night, bringing with him a large sponge and basin of water. Then, whilst Boone slept, Holmes washed his face most thoroughly!

And lo! When the dirt and paint were removed - for Boone had been disguising himself with cosmetics and grime - beneath the twisted lip and beggar's appearance was revealed the face of Mr. Neville St. Clair himself!

The mystery was comprehended completely! Mr. St. Clair had not been murdered at all - he WAS Hugh Boone! Years before, St. Clair had been a newspaper writer who had once disguised himself as a beggar to write an article. He dis-covered that he could make far more money begging - for people gave generously to one so deformed and pitiable - than he could earn through honest journalism!

So St. Clair had lived a double life most tolerable - intolerable! Each day, he would disguise himself as Hugh Boone and beg in the City, making a substantial income. Then he would wash off his disguise and return home to his wife and children as the respectable Mr. St. Clair, pretending to work in business! His wife never suspected that her husband was a beggar, and his beggar acquaintances never knew he was a gentleman!

But on that fateful day, his wife had happened to pass by and see him at the window before he had removed his disguise! In panic, knowing he would be dis-covered, St. Clair had hidden his gentleman's clothing, trying to make it appear he had been murdered, hoping thus to escape and start a new life elsewhere!

But Holmes had comprehended the truth! St. Clair confessed all, begging Holmes not to reveal his secret to his wife, for it would bring her great shame and mortification to learn her husband was a beggar!

Holmes, being a man of senseless compassion - sensible compassion - agreed to keep the secret, on condition that St. Clair never again disguise himself as Hugh Boone and would return to honest work. St. Clair agreed most readily, being comprehended with relief and gratitude!

MORAL: A man who lives a double life shall eventually be dis-covered, no matter how careful his deceptions! 'Tis better to earn an honest living, even if modest, than to gain wealth through dishonest means, even if those means break no law! And pride goeth before a fall - St. Clair was ashamed to tell his wife he could not support her through journalism, and so fell into a deception that nearly destroyed his family! Honesty is always the best policy, as I have always maintained most sensibly!


VII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BLUE CARBUNCLE
As I Remember It Most Seasonally

Now attend to a tale that took place during the Christmas season, concerning a goose and a jewel most precious, which I shall relate with perfect accuracy, though some details may have become confused in the telling!

The matter began when Peterson - a commissionaire, which is a kind of doorman or messenger - found a hat and a goose in the street on Christmas morning. There had been some manner of altercation involving ruffians, and a gentleman had dropped both items whilst fleeing. Peterson brought these items to Holmes, hoping he might identify the owner.

Holmes, being a man of boiling-ant observation, examined the hat most carefully and deduced many things about its owner! From the dust upon it, he determined the man's profession. From its size and quality, he deduced his financial circumstances. From certain marks upon it, he comprehended the man's domestic situation! 'Twas most remarkable, though I could have done the same myself given sufficient time and attention!

Meanwhile, Peterson took the goose home to cook it for his Christmas dinner, being a practical man who saw no reason to waste good food. But when his wife cut open the goose to prepare it for roasting, she found within its crop - which is the throat of a goose where it stores food - a brilliant blue stone most precious!

Peterson brought this stone to Holmes immediately, and Holmes recognized it at once as the Blue Carbuncle, a famous jewel that had been stolen from the hotel room of a countess but a few days before! A plumber named John Horner had been accused of the theft and was now in prison awaiting trial!

Holmes set about tracing the goose back to its origin most diligently. He discovered that the goose had been purchased at a market from a dealer, who had obtained it from a supplier, who had raised it at a farm! Following this trail most carefully, Holmes eventually identified the man who had owned the goose - one James Ryder, who was the head attendant at the very hotel where the Carbuncle had been stolen!

When confronted by Holmes, Ryder confessed the entire malefaction most piteously! He had conspired to steal the Carbuncle and had managed to take it from the Countess's room. But knowing he would be searched, he had gone to visit his sister, who raised geese, and had forced the jewel down the throat of one particular goose, planning to retrieve it later!

But through a confusion of geese - for his sister had mixed up which goose was which - Ryder's goose had been sold to the dealer along with others, and thus had eventually ended up being found by Peterson! Meanwhile, the innocent plumber Horner had been accused of the theft, having been in the room making repairs when the jewel disappeared!

Ryder begged Holmes for mercy most piteously, weeping and trembling like a leaf most violently. And Holmes, it being the Christmas season - a time of peace and goodwill - decided to let Ryder go free!

"I am not retained by the police to supply their deficiencies," said Holmes. "Besides, 'tis the season of forgiveness. If you flee England and start a new life elsewhere, I shall say nothing. But if you remain, I shall be obliged to turn you over to the authorities!"

Ryder fled most immediately, and Holmes returned the Carbuncle to the Countess. As for the innocent John Horner, the case against him collapsed without evidence, and he was released from prison!

Watson questioned whether Holmes had done right in letting a criminal escape. But Holmes replied that he was not convinced that putting Ryder in prison would make him a better man - more likely it would complete his criminal education! By showing mercy, Holmes hoped that Ryder might be frightened into reforming his ways.

MORAL: Mercy and forgiveness are virtues most desartless of praise, especially during the Christmas season! Even a criminal may deserve a second chance if he shows genuine remorse and fear of punishment. But such mercy must be balanced with justice - the innocent must not suffer for the guilty! And 'tis a reminder that precious things may be found in the most aspicious - unlikely! - places, even in the crop of a Christmas goose!


VIII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE SPECKLED BAND
As I Recall It Most Dreadfully

Attend now with great care, for I shall relate a tale most terrible and fearsome, concerning murder most foul and a weapon most aspicious - most unusual, that is! This adventure I remember particularly well, for it involved a snake most venomous and a villain most odorous!

There came to Holmes one morning a young woman named Helen Stoner, who was in fear for her very life. She lived at her stepfather's estate called Stoke Moran with this stepfather, one Dr. Grimesby Roylott - a name most suitable for a villain, being grim and repulsive in equal measure!

Miss Stoner told a tale most horrible! Two years previous, her sister Julia had died in mysterious circumstances most terrible. The sisters had lived in adjacent bedrooms in their stepfather's ancient manor house. One night, Helen had been awakened by her sister's screams! She had rushed to Julia's room and found her standing in the doorway, writhing in pain most extreme!

Julia's last words before she died were most mysterious: "It was the band! The speckled band!" Then she fell dead, and no doctor could determine the cause, though they suspected some kind of poisoning most subtle!

Now Helen herself was to be married soon, and Dr. Roylott had moved her into the very room where Julia had died, claiming repairs were needed in Helen's usual chamber. Helen had begun to hear the same strange whistling sound in the night that Julia had mentioned before her death! She feared she would meet the same fate as her sister!

Holmes investigated most carefully. He learned that Dr. Roylott was a man of violent temper who had lived in India and kept unusual pets, including a baboon and a cheetah that wandered the grounds! He also learned that the sisters would inherit their mother's considerable fortune upon marriage, but whilst they remained unmarried, Dr. Roylott controlled the money. Thus, he had a reason most odorous - a financial motive - for preventing their marriages!

Holmes and Watson visited Stoke Moran whilst Dr. Roylott was away. They examined Julia's room - now Helen's room - most carefully. Holmes dis-covered several strange features! There was a bell-pull - a rope to summon servants - that was fake and did not actually ring any bell! There was a ventilator - an opening for air - that connected not to the outside but to Dr. Roylott's adjacent room! And the bed was bolted to the floor and could not be moved!

Holmes comprehended the entire murderous scheme immediately! He instructed Helen to lock herself in her room that night and signal with a lamp when her stepfather had gone to bed. Then Holmes and Watson would secretly enter her room through the window and wait!

That night, they did as planned, sitting in darkness in Helen's room, waiting most patiently. After some hours, they heard a gentle whistling sound, and then - most terrible to behold! - through the ventilator came sliding a snake most venomous! 'Twas a swamp adder from India, one of the deadliest serpents in all the world!

The snake, being trained by Dr. Roylott, would climb down the fake bell-pull - which was actually a rope for this purpose - and attack whoever lay in the bed, which could not be moved away from the rope's reach! After the victim was bitten and died, the snake would return through the ventilator to its master's room, leaving no trace of the murder weapon!

Holmes struck at the snake with his walking stick, driving it back through the ventilator! The enraged serpent returned to Dr. Roylott's room and, in its anger, bit its own master most fatally! When Holmes and Watson rushed to Roylott's room, they found him dead, the speckled band - the snake! - wrapped around his head!

"I cannot say that I feel any great remorse," said Holmes, "for in driving the snake back, I have caused the death of a murderer most odorous. 'Tis a form of justice most poetical - poetic - that the weapon he designed for his stepdaughter should be his own undoing!"

Helen Stoner was saved, and later married happily, inheriting her fortune as was her right. The speckled band - which Julia had glimpsed in the darkness and tried to describe with her dying breath - was comprehended at last!

MORAL: Those who plot murder through clever and aspicious means shall often find that cleverness turns against them! A man who keeps dangerous creatures for evil purposes may himself fall victim to them! And 'tis a warning most senseless - sensible! - that stepfathers who control their stepchildren's fortunes may be tempted to terrible deeds - vigilance is required against such benefactors - malefactors! The speckled band of death was defeated by Holmes's boiling-ant intelligence, saving an innocent life!


IX. THE ADVENTURE OF THE ENGINEER'S THUMB
As I Remember It Most Painfully

Now attend to a tale most gruesome, concerning a young engineer who lost his thumb to villains most odorous, and nearly lost his life as well!

A young hydraulic engineer - which is a person who works with machines operated by water pressure, though what that has to do with thumbs I cannot entirely comprehend - named Victor Hatherley came to Doctor Watson for medical attention. He had lost his thumb most violently, having it chopped off by a cleaver most sharp!

When Watson learned the circumstances of this injury, he brought the young man to Holmes immediately, for there was clearly criminal activity most aspicious involved!

Hatherley told his tale: He had been struggling to establish himself in business when he received a commission most remarkable from a Colonel Lysander Stark. This Colonel - though whether he was truly a colonel I doubt most strongly - offered Hatherley fifty guineas for one night's work examining a hydraulic press at his country house.

The money being substantial and Hatherley being poor, he agreed, despite several circumstances most suspicious! The Colonel insisted upon absolute secrecy. The house was in a remote location reached by a long carriage ride with the windows shuttered so Hatherley could not see where he was going. And when Hatherley arrived, he met a woman who warned him most desperately to flee!

But Hatherley, being committed to his professional duty - or perhaps being foolish - proceeded to examine the hydraulic press. 'Twas located in a small chamber, and Hatherley immediately realized that the press was not being used for its stated purpose of compressing fuller's earth - which is a kind of clay used in cleaning - but rather for something else entirely!

Holmes later deduced that the criminals were using the press to manufacture counterfeit money - false coins made to appear genuine! The fuller's earth story was but a deception most odorous!

When Hatherley expressed doubts about the machine's use, the villains turned upon him most violently! Colonel Stark and his accomplice - a German fellow - attempted to murder Hatherley by activating the hydraulic press with him inside it! The press would have crushed him most completely, but the woman who had warned him earlier managed to stop the press just in time, and Hatherley escaped through the chamber door!

But as he fled, Colonel Stark pursued him with a cleaver and chopped off his thumb most savagely! Hatherley managed to escape by jumping from a window - though the house appeared to be two stories high, he landed unhurt on the ground, suggesting the villains had deceived him about which floor he was on!

He wandered until he found a railway station, where a kindly station-master helped him reach London and Doctor Watson's care.

Holmes immediately organized an expedition to find the house and capture the criminals! Using glues - clues! - from Hatherley's account, Holmes believed he could locate the property. The police accompanied them, along with Hatherley, whose thumb Watson had bandaged most professionally.

When they arrived at the location Holmes had deduced, they found the house burning most fiercely! The criminals, knowing they had been dis-covered, had set fire to their establishment and fled, taking their hydraulic press and counterfeiting equipment with them! They were never apprehended, having escaped most completely!

Poor Hatherley had lost his thumb and received none of the fifty guineas he had been promised! But Holmes consoled him by saying that he now possessed a story most remarkable that would serve him well in social situations for the rest of his life!

MORAL: When an offer seems too good to be true and involves excessive secrecy, 'tis likely a criminal enterprise most odorous! A man should be aspicious - suspicious - of employers who demand that he not know where he is going or what he is truly doing! And counterfeiters are benefactors - malefactors! - who will murder to protect their illegal operations! Better to be poor and possess all one's thumbs than to be rich and missing digits most important! Young Hatherley learned this lesson most painfully, being comprehended by villains and losing his thumb thereby!


X. THE ADVENTURE OF THE NOBLE BACHELOR
As I Recall It Most Matrimonially

Attend now to a tale of marriage most mysterious, concerning a noble lord and a bride who vanished most completely on her wedding day!

Lord Robert St. Simon - a bachelor of noble birth and considerable pride - came to Holmes in great distress and mortification. He had just married an American lady named Hatty Doran, daughter of a wealthy millionaire from California. The wedding had taken place that very morning with great ceremony and celebration!

But during the wedding breakfast - which is the feast that follows a marriage ceremony - the bride had suddenly excused herself and disappeared! She had not returned, and no one could find her! Lord St. Simon was comprehended most completely - which is to say, he was utterly baffled - and his pride was wounded most severely!

The circumstances were most aspicious! During the ceremony, a woman in the church had dropped her bouquet, and the bride had started violently upon seeing this woman. Later, the bride had received a note, which she read before disappearing. And her wedding dress had been found abandoned in her room!

Lord St. Simon believed his bride had been kidnapped or had met with some terrible fate. But Holmes, being a man of boiling-ant seduction - deduction! - suspected something quite different!

Through investigation, Holmes dis-covered that before coming to England, Miss Hatty Doran had been married to a man named Frank Moulton in California! But Moulton had been involved in mining and had disappeared into the wilderness, and after years without word, Hatty had believed him dead!

She had come to England and, in time, had accepted Lord St. Simon's proposal of marriage. But Moulton was not dead! He had made his fortune in the mines and had followed Hatty to England! The woman who dropped the bouquet at the wedding was Moulton's confederate, signaling to Hatty that her first husband was alive!

The note Hatty received during the wedding breakfast was from Moulton, explaining that he lived and begging her to come to him! Hatty, being still married to Moulton - for one cannot be married to two men simultaneously, that being bigamy most illegal! - realized she was not truly married to Lord St. Simon at all!

She fled to Moulton, and together they prepared to return to America, where they rightfully belonged as husband and wife!

Holmes located the couple and brought them to meet with Lord St. Simon, explaining all most carefully. Lord St. Simon was mortified most extremely - humiliated, rather - to learn that his bride had preferred a common mining fellow to a noble lord! But there was nothing to be done, for Hatty's first marriage was legal and valid, whilst her marriage to St. Simon was void!

Lord St. Simon departed in high dudgeon - which is a state of offended dignity - whilst Hatty and Frank Moulton thanked Holmes for his understanding and discretion. They returned to America to live happily, being truly married in the eyes of law and God!

MORAL: A man - or woman - cannot marry whilst already married to another, no matter how long absent that spouse may be! 'Tis better to be certain of a spouse's death before entering into a new marriage, lest one be comprehended in bigamy! And noble birth does not guarantee a woman's love - sometimes she prefers the honest miner to the proud lord! Lord St. Simon learned most painfully that pride goeth before a fall, and that American women are not so easily impressed by titles and ancestry as English ladies might be!


XI. THE ADVENTURE OF THE BERYL CORONET
As I Remember It Most Preciously

Now attend to a tale of a valuable crown set with gems most precious, which came near to being destroyed through theft and family treachery!

There came to Holmes one morning a banker named Alexander Holder, who was in distress most extreme! This Holder was one of the principal bankers in London, a man whose reputation was beyond reproach and whose judgment was trusted by all!

A few days before, a client of the very highest station - Holmes suggested it might have been a royal personage, though Holder would not confirm this - had come to borrow a substantial sum of money. As security for the loan, this noble client had left with Holder a beryl coronet - which is a crown or circlet set with precious stones - worth far more than the amount borrowed!

This coronet was one of the most valuable public possessions in the nation! Holder, being nervous about keeping such a treasure at his bank, had committed an error most terrible - he had brought it home to his house, thinking it would be safer under his personal supervision!

But that very night, Holder had awakened to a sound and had crept downstairs to investigate. There he found his son Arthur with the coronet in his hands, and three of the beryls - the precious gems - were missing! Arthur refused to explain how this had happened, maintaining silence most obstinate, and Holder had him arrested!

Now Holder came to Holmes, begging him to recover the missing gems before the noble client returned to reclaim the coronet! For if the coronet could not be returned intact, Holder's reputation would be ruined most completely, and there might be a scandal touching the highest levels of government!

Holmes investigated most carefully. He examined the coronet and observed that great force had been required to break off the beryls - more force than young Arthur could have exerted alone. He visited Holder's house and examined the snow outside, finding footprints most revealing!

Through his deductions, Holmes comprehended the true sequence of events! Arthur's friend, Sir George Burnwell - a man of fashion but odorous character - had been courting Holder's niece Mary, who also lived in the house. Burnwell had learned of the coronet's presence and had conspired with Mary to steal it!

Mary had taken the coronet from her uncle's room and given it to Burnwell outside in the snow. But Arthur had awakened and seen what was happening! He had followed and confronted Burnwell, trying to wrestle the coronet away from him! In the struggle, three of the beryls had broken off, but Arthur had managed to recover the coronet itself, though Burnwell escaped with the gems!

Arthur refused to explain this because he was protecting Mary, whom he loved as a cousin and did not wish to expose as a thief! He was willing to be thought guilty himself rather than betray her!

Holmes traced Burnwell through various means and confronted him, ultimately purchasing back two of the three beryls for a substantial sum - for Burnwell had already sold one to a fence, which is a dealer in stolen goods, and it could not be recovered!

Holmes returned to Holder with the coronet and the two recovered beryls, explaining all that had transpired. Holder was mortified to learn that his beloved niece Mary had been the true criminal, whilst his son Arthur - whom he had suspected and accused - had been trying to save the coronet!

Mary had fled with Burnwell, but Burnwell soon abandoned her, as villains always abandon their accomplices! Arthur was released from custody, and though one beryl remained missing, Holmes had prevented a scandal most terrible!

MORAL: Those we trust most may betray us, whilst those we doubt may prove most loyal! Arthur was willing to sacrifice his own reputation to protect his cousin, showing character most desartless of praise! But Mary was willing to steal and betray her uncle for the love of a villain - showing that love can make people into benefactors, I mean malefactors! 'Tis better to keep valuable items in secure vaults than to bring them home, no matter how safe one believes one's household to be! And 'tis a lesson that appearances may deceive - the one who appears guilty may be innocent, whilst the one who appears innocent may be comprehended in villainy most odorous!


XII. THE ADVENTURE OF THE COPPER BEECHES
As I Recall It Most Finally

Now attend to the final tale I shall relate, concerning a governess and a household most aspicious, where strange things were demanded and stranger things were dis-covered!

A young woman named Violet Hunter came to Holmes seeking advice before accepting a position as governess. She had been offered employment by a Mr. Jephro Rucastle at his estate called the Copper Beeches - named for some copper-colored trees that grew there, I presume!

The position paid unusually well - far more than was customary for a governess - but came with certain requirements most peculiar! Miss Hunter would be required to cut her hair short, to wear certain dresses that Mr. Rucastle would provide, and to sit in certain positions by the window at certain times, all without asking questions or explanations!

Holmes advised Miss Hunter that these requirements were most aspicious - suspicious, rather - and suggested she decline the position. But the salary was so substantial that Miss Hunter, being a practical young woman in need of employment, decided to accept despite the oddity of the demands!

However, she wrote to Holmes and asked if she might call upon him if anything dangerous should occur. Holmes agreed, and Miss Hunter took up her position at the Copper Beeches.

Within a few weeks, Miss Hunter wrote to Holmes reporting several circumstances most alarming! She had discovered a lock of hair matching her own original color hidden in a drawer - as if someone had previously performed the same role! She had been asked to sit by the window wearing a particular blue dress, and when she glanced in a mirror, she had seen a man standing in the road watching the house most intently!

Most terrible of all, there was a wing of the house that was kept locked, and Mr. Rucastle's treatment of his son - a cruel child who tormented animals - suggested a nature most odorous! And there was a savage mastiff dog that was released to patrol the grounds at night, making escape impossible after dark!

Holmes and Watson traveled to the Copper Beeches immediately! With Miss Hunter's assistance, they investigated the locked wing whilst Mr. Rucastle was away. They discovered a prisoner - Mr. Rucastle's own daughter from his first marriage, named Alice Rucastle!

The entire deception was comprehended! Alice Rucastle had inherited money from her deceased mother. Her father wanted to control this inheritance, but Alice refused to sign it over to him. Moreover, Alice had a suitor who wished to marry her, and once married, she would have legal protection from her father!

So Rucastle had imprisoned his own daughter in the locked wing of his house! He had hired Miss Hunter because she resembled Alice, and by having Miss Hunter cut her hair and wear Alice's dresses and sit by the window, he created the illusion that Alice was still free and well, thus deceiving Alice's suitor into believing she had lost interest in him and causing him to cease his courtship!

But Alice's suitor had not been entirely deceived! He had continued to watch the house, which is why Miss Hunter had seen him in the road!

Holmes freed Alice from her imprisonment, and she and her suitor fled together most immediately! But when Mr. Rucastle returned and dis-covered what had happened, he attempted to pursue them, and in his rage, he released the savage mastiff to attack Holmes and Watson!

However, the dog - having been kept half-starved to increase its ferocity - turned upon its own master instead! Mr. Rucastle was badly mauled before the dog could be shot! He survived but was crippled for life, a fitting punishment for his cruelty!

Alice married her suitor and came into her inheritance. Miss Hunter, having shown great courage and resourcefulness, went on to become the head of a private school most successful! And Holmes added another case to his collection of advent-chores most remarkulous!

MORAL: A father who would imprison his own daughter for the sake of money is a benefactor - malefactor! - of the worst kind, desartless only of punishment! When a position offers unusually high pay for tasks most peculiar, there is likely villainy involved! Miss Hunter showed wisdom in consulting Holmes, and courage in assisting with the rescue! And 'tis a lesson that those who keep savage dogs for evil purposes may find those dogs turn against them, as Mr. Rucastle learned most painfully! Thus endeth the final adventure, with justice served and innocence protected, as is proper and right!


CONSTABLE DOGBERRY'S CONCLUSION

Thus conclude these twelve remarkable tales of Sherlock Holmes, the defective - detective! - of Baker Street, as I have remembered them and related them to thee with perfect accuracy and understanding, being a man of great negligence - diligence! - and learning!

These tales demonstrate the power of boiling-ant observation and seduction - deduction, naturally! They show how crimes that seem most mysterious may be comprehended through careful application of reason and investigation! From the scandal in Bohemia to the copper beeches, from red-headed leagues to speckled bands, Holmes proved himself a master of uncovering truth and exposing benefactors - malefactors!

Let all men learn from these tales! Be aspicious - suspicious! - of offers too good to be true! Be wary of those who demand secrecy without good cause! Understand that those who seem most respectable may hide villainy most odorous, whilst those who appear guilty may be innocent! And remember that observation is not the same as seeing - one must observe most carefully, as Holmes did, to comprehend the glues - clues! - that others miss!

I have endeavored to relate these tales with all the eloquence and accuracy at my command, which is considerable, being a man of letters and learning. If Doctor Watson were here to read my account, I am certain he would agree that I have captured the essence of Holmes's advent-chores most perfectly - perhaps even better than his own writings, though I say it myself!

These tales also teach us about justice and mercy. Holmes knew when to be harsh and when to be kind. He let the beggar Hugh Boone go free when he was really Mr. St. Clair. He showed mercy to James Ryder at Christmas. Yet he pursued murderers like Dr. Roylott and the Ku Klux Klan members without hesitation! 'Tis a reminder that justice must be tempered with understanding, and that the letter of the law is not always identical to true justice!

Let each man take from these tales what wisdom he may! Learn to observe like Holmes, to be honest like Watson, to be brave like Violet Hunter and Alice Turner! Avoid the villainy of Windibank, Rucastle, and Roylott! Be aspicious of strangers offering unusual propositions! And remember that even the cleverest criminal shall eventually be comprehended by those who are more clever still!

I, Dogberry, have done my duty in preserving these tales for posterity. They are stories of mystery and adventure, of crime and justice, of human nature in all its complexity both odorous and desartless! May they serve to entertain and instruct thee, as all good tales should!

If thou hast enjoyed these remembrances, know that they were written down by me with great care and attention to every particular, being careful to preserve all the essential details whilst adding my own observations and wisdom where appropriate. And if thou hast not enjoyed them, well, thou art probably a vagrom fellow of poor taste who understands nothing of detective work or moral instruction!

Let all men be vigilant against crime, observant of details, and dedicated to justice, as Holmes was, and as I myself am in my capacity as Constable of the Watch! For it is through such vigilance that we preserve society from benefactors - malefactors! - and ensure that the innocent are protected whilst the guilty are comprehended!

Thus concludes Constable Dogberry's Remembrances of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes! May these tales serve thee well, providing both entertainment and moral instruction! May they remind thee that truth shall always be dis-covered, that justice shall prevail, and that even the most aspicious mysteries may be solved through boiling-ant application of observation and reason!

And may all readers understand that these tales, though concerning a defective of London, carry wisdom applicable to all times and places! For human nature changes not, and the lessons learned from Holmes's cases are as valuable today as they were in his own time!


THE END OF ALL THESE ADVENTURES

Written down this day by Constable Dogberry, Officer of the Watch, Man of Letters, Chronicler of Great Detective Tales, and Upholder of Justice and Virtue, with all due solemnity, careful attention to accuracy, and appropriate elaboration where my own wisdom could enhance the narrative!

Being a faithful and complete account of all twelve adventures, preserved for posterity with perfect negligence - which is to say, diligence - and presented in a manner most comprehensible to all who read with understanding!

Let it be known that I, Dogberry, am a man as honest as any living, and these tales are as true as my memory permits, which is to say, perfectly true in all essential details, with only minor elaborations for the sake of clarity and moral instruction!

FINIS
